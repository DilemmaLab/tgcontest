    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia Banned From Olympics and Global Sports for 4 Years Over Doping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Global antidoping leaders agreed unanimously on Monday to banish Russia from international sports — including next summer’s Olympic Games in Tokyo — for four years, the latest and severest punishment yet connected to a yearslong cheating scheme that has tarnished global sport.
The World Anti-Doping Agency’s punishment means that Russia’s flag, name and anthem will not be allowed at the Tokyo Games, though the practical competitive effects may be minimal: Russian athletes not implicated in doping could compete in the Olympics and other world championships, but only under a neutral flag. The agency also barred Russian sports and government officials from the Games and prohibited the country from hosting international events.
The move, which comes four years after the first details of the scheme that peaked at the 2014 Sochi Olympics were made public, was hailed by WADA as a tough step, though some antidoping leaders questioned that.
“For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,” WADA president Craig Reedie said at a news conference. “Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and rejoin the global antidoping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.”
To some, including many athlete groups and national antidoping agencies, the punishment does not go far enough, because it leaves open the possibility that hundreds of Russian athletes can appear in Tokyo, just as they did at the Winter Olympics in South Korea last year.
The decision is unlikely to surprise many given the scale of Russia’s attempt to conceal, obfuscate and frustrate attempts to unmask the beneficiaries of a state-powered doping program, remarkable for its sophistication and scope.
Still, Russia is almost certain to contest the decision. It continues to steadfastly deny many of the allegations, even after several independent investigations that have revealed a welter of evidence against it.
Russian officials have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after the announcement from the antidoping agency, which convened for a special meeting near the International Olympic Committee’s headquarters in Lausanne.
The Russian prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, encouraged an appeal, saying that the antidoping agency’s decision looked to him like a “continuation of anti-Russian hysteria.”
But he offered a concession. “The Russian side, too, — by that I mean our sports community — still has significant problems with doping,” he said. “This is undeniable.”
The WADA board agreed to a suite of punishments detailed in a report from a committee led by the British lawyer Jonathan Taylor that it received late last month. The penalties include forcing Russian athletes who have not been implicated in doping to compete at a second consecutive Olympic Games in neutral uniforms and to collect any medals they win without the raising of the nation’s flag or the playing of its anthem.
They also bar Russian government officials and representatives from attending major events or from serving on the board of any organization that has signed the global antidoping code, prevent Russia from bidding on new championships, and require moving any international events the country was set to host during the four-year period.
Linda Helleland, a Norwegian who is the outgoing vice president of the antidoping agency, expressed frustration at the decision, saying she wanted the punishment to ensure that Russian athletes would not be able to compete independently, as they did in South Korea, during the ban.
But Helleland said that was not an option for what she called “the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen,” because the board was limited to two choices: Agree with the punishments recommended by Taylor’s committee, or reject them.
“I am not happy with the decision we made today,” Helleland told reporters at the conclusion of the hourlong meeting. “This was as far as we could go.”
Travis T. Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said: “To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law. And, in turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.”
If Russia is unable to have the ruling overturned, the country’s ouster from the world of international sport would stretch to events well beyond the Olympics, including soccer’s World Cup.
WADA officials said the practicalities of Russia’s ban still needed to be worked out with individual sports federations. For example, Russia would be allowed to compete in the qualification matches for the 2022 World Cup, though should it progress to the tournament the team would be allowed to participate only as a neutral, without any insignia that would identify the team as being Russian.
What has angered many is Russia’s mendacity in the face of efforts to rehabilitate the country after whistle-blower evidence helped unravel a meticulously planned — and ultimately successful — scheme in which Russian antidoping experts and members of the country’s intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
As part of the resolution of that case, Russia agreed to provide a set of testing results to doping regulators from its Moscow laboratory. It is that database, which Russia was found to have manipulated, that is at the heart of a crisis that threatens its sporting future.
Taylor, who will be stepping down from his role at WADA at the end of the year, told The New York Times that he could understand why some people would think the penalties did not go far enough, but he insisted that the measures meted out in Switzerland on Monday amounted to a humiliation for the Russian authorities.
“Don’t tell me that doesn’t affect them,” he said. “There’s national pride; what happens if this neutral team wins the World Cup and Putin’s not there? Don’t tell me it doesn’t mean anything.”
While the pressure has been ratcheting up on Russia from the outside, inside the country there has been a propaganda campaign that has attempted to discredit the findings as just another Western plot.
One Russian talk show described the revelations as an attempt by Russia’s rivals to eliminate a potential medal-winning opponent, while a documentary tried to lay the blame on the whistle-blower, Grigory Rodchenkov, who helped mastermind the scheme from his position as the head of the Moscow laboratory. The claims mirror those of Russian officials who were proved by WADA investigators to frame Rodchenkov and hide the identity of the true culprits.
Russia’s denials and manipulations of data continued well after WADA had gone public in September with confirmation that thousands of crucial Russian files had been deleted or manipulated, and that the data that was provided did not match a database on Russian athletes that it received in 2017.
In a follow-up meeting in October to help explain the discrepancies, Russia’s sports minister provided WADA with fresh data, which when studied revealed yet more manipulation.
Taylor used an expletive to describe Russia’s efforts to frame Rodchenkov, which involved fabricating messages between the former laboratory director and his staff, to suggest they were plotting to extort Russian athletes by falsely accusing them of failing drugs tests. Details of that scheme and other manipulated evidence were brought to WADA’s attention by the sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov. “I don’t know if he is corrupt or incompetent,” Taylor said of Kolobkov, a former fencer who was appointed to his post after revelations of Russia’s vast doping scheme.
“After all of this, who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost?” Rodchenkov said in a statement. “Russia dug its own grave and has ruined the chances for any clean Russian athlete to compete. If the files were deleted, how can any athlete credibly prove its innocence?”
A rare voice of dissent in Russia has come from the current head of its antidoping agency, Yuri Ganus. For months, as the crisis has grown, Ganus has spoken out against his country’s handling of the scheme, telling the world that he believed thousands of athlete files had likely been deleted to save the reputations of some of Russia’s most significant figures.
He told The New York Times that the punishment was logical, but he would back an appeal he went on to describe a “mission impossible” to prevent a generation of clean athletes from being punished for a scheme they had no part in. Ganus called on Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to personally become involved. “I think there is only one person who can change the situation,” Ganus said.
Margarita Pakhnotskaya, the deputy head of Russia’s antidoping agency, said that the ban should prompt action by officials in her country who have suggested that Russia was being unfairly targeted.
“This is another reason for sports executives to think about whether we are moving in the right direction,” the Interfax news agency quoted her as saying. “I’m hearing presidents of federations and experts proudly trumpet their activities — ‘We have given all the answers, we’re surrounded only by enemies who are attacking our athletes.’ This all shows that there has been no change in our antidoping culture.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia banned from 2022 FIFA World Cup and 2020 Olympics following doping decision</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia are set to miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulating laboratory data after the doping scandal that has rocked sport.
Their executive committee concluded Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify cheats.
The WADA board convened for a special meeting on Monday close to the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and ruled unanimously in favour of the global ban.
It is the most severe punishment yet connected to the cheating scheme, which peaked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
However, the football team is set to be clear to compete in Euro 2020 - with Saint Petersburg a host city - as the competition is organised by UEFA, who are not defined as a "major event organisation" with regards to anti-doping breaches.
The punishments come four years after details of the doping scheme were made public, with specific bans on Russian sports and government officials which prohibits the country from hosting international events.
Russia could still contest the decision and look set to do so as it continues to deny many allegations despite several independent investigations finding wrongdoing.
Officials from the country have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but if unsuccessful then they face missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the Olympics in Tokyo 2020.
Many athletes have been sidelined from the past two Olympic games and the country was stripped of its flag at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as punishment for its Sochi cover-ups.
The latest sanctions were recommended by WADA's compliance review committee and effectively strip Russia's anti-doping agency, RUSADA, of its accreditation.
Last month, Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory date to technical issues.
The punishment does not put a blanket ban on clean Russian athletes, leaving them said to be clear to compete without their flag or anthem as they did in Pyeongchang.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA imposes four-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency has imposed a four-year ban on Russia using its flag, anthem and team names at Olympic and other major sports events.
The ban means Russia will be unable to formally compete in next summer's Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.
Other major events that fall during the four-year period include world championships and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
WADA's executive committee voted in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday and concluded that officials in a Moscow anti-doping laboratory had tampered with data.
The tampering -- before and while the data was being forensically copied by WADA -- included planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. System messages were also fabricated in an effort to hamper the work of WADA investigators.
The executive committee's decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, an agency spokesperson said. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem, as was the case during the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
When asked for clarification on Russia's participation in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup and the tournament itself, a FIFA spokesperson told ESPN: "FIFA has taken note of the decision taken by WADA's Executive Committee today. FIFA is in contact with WADA and the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football."
ESPN also reached out to the International Olympic Committee, which responded that it supports WADA's decision.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency has 21 days to appeal the sanctions, and if it does so, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, WADA has said.
"The position of Russia's Olympic Committee remains unchanged -- sanctions are inadequate, illogical and excessive," Russia's Olympic Committee President Stanislav Pozdnyakov said in response to the sanctions.
"Of course, we are disappointed, but we initially assumed that the recommendations of the WADA Executive Committee would be approved without change, especially after the main points were made public."
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals, notably since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes banned from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but was reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
Sports minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the lab data to technical issues and on Monday told reporters that "everything possible was done to resolve this situation."
The consequences of WADA's ruling dictate that no Russian government representatives may participate in or attend any Olympic or other sports event put on by a major event organisation over the four-year period. As such, Russian president Vladimir Putin will not be able to attend the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, nor the 2022 World Cup -- should the ban affect that tournament.
Additionally, Russia may not host any major event in the four-year period, and where the right to host such an event has already been awarded to Russia, that right must be withdrawn and re-assigned to another country as far as is legally or practically possible.
The 2020 European Championship football tournament, in which Russia's Saint Petersburg Stadium is set to host several games, is not considered a major event by WADA, therefore Russian participation and hosting will not be affected.
As part of Monday's ruling, Russia also is not permitted to bid for the right to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, irrespective of whether the bidding takes place during or after the four-year period.
Some Russian officials have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
But WADA president Craig Reedie said: "The ExCo's strong decision today shows WADA's determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA's reinstatement conditions ... demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered today.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA bans Russia from Olympics over doping scandals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia will be barred from competing in next year’s Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned the powerhouse from global sports for four years as punishment for tampering with a Moscow lab database.
WADA’s executive committee decided during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, that Russia be suspended after the agency accused Moscow of falsifying doping data handed over to investigators earlier this year, according to Agence France-Presse.
Not only will the country have no formal presence in the next Olympic cycle, but government officials will be barred from attending any major events, while Russia will lose the right to host, or even bid for, tournaments.
“WADA’s executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years,” WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said.
Under the sanctions, Russian athletes will still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what WADA believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
“They are going to have to prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation,” Fitzgerald said.
The committee made the decision after concluding that Moscow had tampered with lab data by planting fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats, WADA investigators and the International Olympic Committee said last month.
“Flagrant manipulation” of the Moscow lab data was “an insult to the sporting movement worldwide,” the IOC said last month.
It remained unclear how the ruling will affect Russian teams taking part in world championships such as soccer’s World Cup in 2022.
Russia’s anti-doping agency RUSADA can appeal WADA’s decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of RUSADA — which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year — had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the lab data. The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.
RUSADA head Yuri Ganus could not be immediately reached for comment. His deputy, Margarita Pakhnotskaya, told the TASS news agency that WADA’s decision had been expected, according to Reuters.
Last month, Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov attributed the discrepancies in the lab data to technical issues.
“I’m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,” said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian lawmaker who serves on the WADA executive committee and has long urged a tougher line against Russia.
“This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologize on all the pain all the athletes and sports fans have experienced,” Helleland added.
The perennial global sports power has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Many Russian athletes were sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country was stripped of its flag altogether at last year’s PyeongChang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
In PyeongChang, 168 Russians who had not been implicated in the country’s state-sponsored doping scheme competed as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”
Former WADA president Dick Pound, who chaired the commission that in 2015 alleged mass doping in Russian athletics, said Moscow had gone “too far” this time.
“The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer,” Pound told AFP.
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia — which hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the World Cup in 2018 — “on many levels” in the sporting world.
“On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it’s among the sporting giants, so that’s influential,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian athletes banned for 4 years on doping charges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia was banned from the world's top sporting events for four years on Monday, including the next summer and winter Olympics and the 2022 soccer World Cup, for tampering with doping tests.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee acted after concluding that Moscow had planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests in laboratory data that could have helped identify drug cheats.
The decision was a huge blow to the pride of a nation that has traditionally been a powerhouse in many sports but whose reputation has been tarnished by a series of doping scandals.
“For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,” WADA President Craig Reedie said after a meeting of WADA's executive committee in the Swiss city of Lausanne.
He said in a statement Russia's actions had demanded a robust response and added: “That is exactly what has been delivered today.”
WADA confirmed the Russian national team could not take part in the 2022 World Cup soccer in Qatar under the Russian flag and could participate only as neutrals.
It was not clear how competing as neutrals at the World Cup might work in practice. FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said it was in contact with WADA to clarify the extent of the decision.
The ban also means Russian sportsmen and sportswomen will not be able to perform at the Olympics in Tokyo next year under their own flag and national anthem.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has come under attack for not taking a harder line on Russian doping, said it fully backed the ruling by the Swiss-based WADA. The 2020 Tokyo Olympic organising committee said it would welcome all athletes as long as they were clean and work with other organisations to fully implement anti-doping measures, Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya said.
Russia has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Many of Russia's athletes were sidelined from the past two Olympics and Russia was stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions, which also include a four-year ban on Russia hosting major sporting events, were recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, suspended in 2015 but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
The sanctions in effect strip the agency of its accreditation.
The punishment leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at big international events without their flag or anthem for the next four years, something they did at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials have tried to cast WADA's behaviour as part of what they say is a broader Western attempt to hold back Moscow.
Igor Lebedev, a lawmaker and deputy speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, said the move was a serious blow to Russian sport that required a tough response from Russian authorities, the RIA news agency reported.
If RUSADA appeals WADA's punishment, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Some sport officials wanted tougher action. Travis Tygart, head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), said the failure to impose a complete ban was “yet another devastating blow to clean athletes.”
Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow's suspended anti-doping laboratory, said that without the complete data from the Moscow laboratory there was no telling how many athletes were still competing doped.
“Russia's falsifications and cheating continued in 2019 even when Russia was under scrutiny,” Rodchenkov, now in hiding in the United States, said in a statement.
Noting that many files had been deleted and results lost, he said: “Who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA imposes four-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency has imposed a four-year ban on Russia using its flag, anthem and team names at Olympic and other major sports events.
The ban means Russia will be unable to formally compete in next summer's Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.
Other major events that fall during the four-year period include world championships and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
WADA's executive committee voted in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday and concluded that officials in a Moscow anti-doping laboratory had tampered with data.
The tampering -- before and while the data was being forensically copied by WADA -- included planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. System messages were also fabricated in an effort to hamper the work of WADA investigators.
The executive committee's decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, an agency spokesperson said. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem, as was the case during the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
When asked for clarification on Russia's participation in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup and the tournament itself, a FIFA spokesperson told ESPN: "FIFA has taken note of the decision taken by WADA's Executive Committee today. FIFA is in contact with WADA and the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football."
ESPN also reached out to the International Olympic Committee, which responded that it supports WADA's decision.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency has 21 days to appeal the sanctions, and if it does so, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, WADA has said.
"The position of Russia's Olympic Committee remains unchanged -- sanctions are inadequate, illogical and excessive," Russia's Olympic Committee President Stanislav Pozdnyakov said in response to the sanctions.
"Of course, we are disappointed, but we initially assumed that the recommendations of the WADA Executive Committee would be approved without change, especially after the main points were made public."
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals, notably since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes banned from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but was reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
Sports minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the lab data to technical issues and on Monday told reporters that "everything possible was done to resolve this situation."
The consequences of WADA's ruling dictate that no Russian government representatives may participate in or attend any Olympic or other sports event put on by a major event organisation over the four-year period. As such, Russian president Vladimir Putin will not be able to attend the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, nor the 2022 World Cup -- should the ban affect that tournament.
Additionally, Russia may not host any major event in the four-year period, and where the right to host such an event has already been awarded to Russia, that right must be withdrawn and re-assigned to another country as far as is legally or practically possible.
The 2020 European Championship football tournament, in which Russia's Saint Petersburg Stadium is set to host several games, is not considered a major event by WADA, therefore Russian participation and hosting will not be affected.
As part of Monday's ruling, Russia also is not permitted to bid for the right to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, irrespective of whether the bidding takes place during or after the four-year period.
Some Russian officials have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
But WADA president Craig Reedie said: "The ExCo's strong decision today shows WADA's determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA's reinstatement conditions ... demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered today.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wada bans Russia from international competitions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE
Russia will miss next year's Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned the powerhouse from global sporting events for four years over manipulated doping data.
Wada's executive committee, meeting in Lausanne, decided that Russia be handed the four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory doping data handed over to investigators earlier this year.
Not only will Russia be ruled out of the next Olympic cycle, but Russian government officials will be barred from attending any major events, while the country will lose the right to host, or even bid, for tournaments.
"Wada's executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years," Wada spokesman James Fitzgerald said.
Under the sanctions, Russian sportsmen and women will still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what Wada believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
"They are going to have prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation," Fitzgerald said.
The independent report by Richard McLaren, released in 2016, revealed the significant extent of state-sponsored doping in Russia, notably between 2011 and 2015.
It led to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) being suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations of a vast state-supported doping programme.
REINSTATEMENT
Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's controversial reinstatement by Wada in September 2018.
The Wada decision was widely predicted, with the body's president, Craig Reedie, having made a presentation Saturday to the Olympic Summit, participants of which "strongly condemned those responsible for the manipulation of the data from the Moscow laboratory".
"It was agreed that this was an attack on sport and that these actions should lead to the toughest sanctions against those responsible," the IOC said in a statement.
"It was stressed by the participants that full justice must be finally done so that the guilty ones can be properly punished and the innocent ones are fully protected."
The IOC (International Olympic Committee) asked that the Russian authorities deliver the "fully authenticated raw data".
Former Wada president Dick Pound, who chaired the commission that in 2015 made damning accusations of mass doping in Russian athletics, said Moscow had this time gone "too far".
"The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer," Pound told AFP.
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia -- which in recent years hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the football World Cup in 2018 -- "on many levels" in the sporting world.
"On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it's among the sporting giants, so that's influential," he said.
"It's (also) influential because Russia hosts and is willing to host many competitions for international federations, especially those who don't have much money of their own, so they have a considerable influence among the international federations.
"And they've been quite strategic about making sure that they get Russians into positions on international federations. So they have an impact from inside as well as from outside."
A majority of Wada's influential athlete committee had called overnight for a "complete ban on Russian participation", nine members of the 17-strong group saying such a move was "the only meaningful sanction".
"We maintain that the fraud, manipulation and deception revealed to date will only be encouraged and perpetuated with a lesser response," they said.
"To date, the Russian doping saga has dominated three Olympic and Paralympic Games, with a fourth on the horizon. Russia's ongoing and intentional acts of deception, fraud and corruption have made a mockery not only those who play by the rules, but those who create and safeguard them."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia to discover sporting fate as WADA meets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE: Russia faces a four-year ban from international sporting competitions, including the Olympic Games, when the World Anti-Doping Agency hold a crucial meeting in Lausanne.
WADA's executive committee is expected to approve a recommendation by its Compliance Review Committee that Russia be handed a four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory doping data handed over to investigators earlier this year.
Such a heavy sanction would see Russia ruled out of next year's Tokyo Olympics and the Winter Games in Beijing in 2022.
Russian government officials would be barred from attending any major events, while the country would lose the right to host, or even bid, for tournaments.
Under the proposed sanctions, Russian sportsmen and women would still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what WADA believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's controversial reinstatement by WADA in September 2018.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) had been suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations of a vast state-supported doping program.
Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, refused to speculate on the outcome of the WADA meeting, but asked for a "clear" answer for events that might be affected.
"I'm not in a position to speculate," said Bach on Thursday (Dec 5) after a meeting of the IOC's own Executive Board. "I don't know the details of the decision WADA could take.
"I hope that WADA will be clear on the events to which this decision will refer and why it applies or not.
"This is in the hands of WADA and in particular the CRC (Compliance Review Committee)," Bach added, making clear the decision would be binding on the IOC as "a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code".
"ATTACK ON SPORT"
WADA president Craig Reedie made a presentation Saturday to the Olympic Summit, participants of which "strongly condemned those responsible for the manipulation of the data from the Moscow laboratory".
"It was agreed that this was an attack on sport and that these actions should lead to the toughest sanctions against those responsible," the IOC said in a statement.

"The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer," Pound told AFP.
"Much of the stuff we are looking back now is 2011, 2015. We are years later and many of those athletes are no longer competing and there is a new generation of athlete, many of whom have been regularly tested."
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia - which in recent years hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics as well as the football World Cup in 2018 - "on many levels" in the sporting world.
"On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it's among the sporting giants, so that's influential," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anti-doping agency imposes 4-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND -- Russia was slapped Monday with a four-year ban from international sports events, including next summer's Tokyo Olympics, over a longstanding doping scandal, although its athletes will still be able to compete if they can show they are clean competitors.
The ruling by the World Anti-Doping Agency's executive committee means that Russia's flag, name and anthem will not appear at the Tokyo Games, and the country also could be stripped of hosting world championships in Olympic sports.
The sanctions are the harshest punishment yet for Russian state authorities who were accused of tampering with a Moscow laboratory database. Russia's anti-doping agency can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days -- an action it has signalled it would take.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order ... but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial," WADA president Craig Reedie said.
Russian athletes can compete in major events only if they are not implicated in positive doping tests or if their data was not manipulated, according to the WADA ruling.
For soccer's 2022 World Cup, WADA said the Russian team will play under its name in the qualifying program in Europe. If it qualifies to play in Qatar, the team name must be changed to something neutral that likely would not include the word "Russia."
At the past two track and field world championships, Russians competed as "Authorized Neutral Athlete." A softer line was taken ahead of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games, when the International Olympic Committee suspended the Russian Olympic body yet allowed athletes and teams to compete as "Olympic Athlete from Russia."
Going forward, "they cannot use the name of the country in the name of the team," WADA president-elect Witold Banka told The Associated Press.
Legal fallout from the WADA ruling at CAS seems sure to dominate preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which open July 24.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged sports organizations to appeal and said WADA's ruling was "a continuation of this anti-Russian hysteria which has already become chronic."
The latest round of sanctions were imposed because tampering with the Moscow data was a new violation of anti-doping rules committed as recently as January.
Handing over a clean database to WADA was a key requirement given to Russia 15 months ago to help bring closure to a scandal that has tainted the Olympics over the last decade.
WADA investigators and the IOC agreed that evidence showed Russian authorities corrupted data from the Moscow lab that was long sealed by security forces. Hundreds of potential doping cases were deleted and evidence falsely planted to shift the blame onto whistleblowers.
"Flagrant manipulation" of the data was "an insult to the sporting movement worldwide," the IOC said last month.
Athletes whose data was manipulated in the 2012-15 testing period now face disciplinary cases by their sport's governing body.
"Yes, we do know who those athletes are. They will be kept out of the (Tokyo) Games," said British lawyer Jonathan Taylor, chairman of the WADA panel whose proposed sanctions were unanimously approved Monday.
However, the doping watchdog's outgoing vice-president was left frustrated by an unwillingness to fully expel Russia from the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games.
"I'm not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go," said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian lawmaker who has long pushed for a tougher line against Russia. "This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologize on all the pain all the athletes and sports fans have experienced."
Although the IOC has called for the strongest possible sanctions, it wants those sanctions directed at Russian state authorities rather than athletes or Olympic officials.
That position was opposed by most of WADA's athlete commission. It wanted the kind of blanket ban Russia avoided for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games when a state-run doping program was exposed by media and WADA investigations after Russia hosted the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.
The decision to appeal has been stripped from RUSADA chief executive Yuri Ganus, an independent figure criticizing Russian authorities' conduct on the doping data issue. Authority was passed to the agency's supervisory board after an intervention led by the Russian Olympic Committee.
The ROC on Saturday labeled the expected sanctions as "illogical and inappropriate."
Russia has stuck to its claim that deceptive edits in the data were in fact made by WADA's star witness, Grigory Rodchenkov. The former Moscow lab director's flight into the witness protection program in the United States was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary.
"As usual, Russia has disregarded all of its promises and obligations to clean sport," Rodchenkov said Monday in a statement from his lawyers.
Sports fans worldwide will still be watching top-tier events from Russia in the next four years despite the hosting ban.
In soccer, St. Petersburg will still host four games at the 2020 European Championship and the 2021 Champions League final, because European soccer body UEFA is not bound by the ruling. Nor is the Formula 1 racing series, which goes to Sochi's Olympic Park for a race each year.
"The contract is valid through 2025," Russian Grand Prix spokeswoman Tatyana Rivnaya told the AP in a telephone interview.
World championships in lower-profile Olympic sports -- including luge in two months and wrestling in 2022 -- could stay in Russia due to legal difficulties moving them.
"There will be practical issues," Taylor acknowledged, "and we can't ignore those."
However, Taylor said a block on Russia bidding for or being awarded sports events in the next four years would have a longer effect beyond the ban.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC reports that Russia has been handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
It means the Russia flag and anthem will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and football’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal will be able to compete under a neutral flag.
Wada’s executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
It comes after Russia’s Anti Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.
It had to hand over data to Wada as a condition of its controversial reinstatement in 2018 after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.
It has 21 days to appeal against the ban.
A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned at the 2014 Games in Sochi.
Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.
Despite the ban, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 – in which St Petersburg will be a host city – as European football’s governing body Uefa is not defined as a ‘major event organisation’ with regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND -- The Russian flag and national anthem were banned from next year's Tokyo Olympics and other major sports events for four years on Monday.
Russia's hosting of world championships in Olympic sports also face being stripped after the World Anti-Doping Agency executive committee approved a full slate of recommended sanctions as punishment for state authorities tampering with a Moscow laboratory database.
Russian athletes will be allowed to compete in major events only if they are not implicated in positive doping tests or if their data was not manipulated, according to the WADA ruling.
Still, it is unclear how the ruling will affect Russian teams taking part in world championships such as soccer's World Cup.
Russia's anti-doping agency can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days.
Legal fallout from the WADA ruling seems sure to dominate preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which open on July 24.
Evidence shows that Russian authorities tampered with a Moscow laboratory database to hide hundreds of potential doping cases and falsely shift the blame onto whistleblowers, WADA investigators and the International Olympic Committee said last month.

Although the IOC has called for the strongest possible sanctions, it wants those sanctions directed at Russian state authorities rather than athletes or Olympic officials.
That position was opposed by most of WADA's athlete commission. It wanted the kind of blanket ban Russia avoided for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games after a state-run doping program was exposed by media and WADA investigations after Russia hosted the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.
"This entire fiasco created by Russia has cheated far too many athletes of their dreams and rightful careers, for far too long," the WADA athlete panel said in a statement ahead of the meeting.
Russia previously signalled it would appeal the ruling. That must be filed by the Russian anti-doping agency, known as RUSADA. That body was declared non-compliant on Monday, 15 months after it was reinstated by WADA in defiance of athlete opposition.
The decision to appeal has been stripped from RUSADA chief executive Yuri Ganus, an independent figure criticizing Russian authorities' conduct on the doping data issue. Authority was passed to the agency's supervisory board after an intervention led by the Russian Olympic Committee.
The ROC on Saturday labeled the expected sanctions as "illogical and inappropriate."
Russia has stuck to its claim that deceptive edits in the data were in fact made by WADA's star witness, Grigory Rodchenkov. The former Moscow lab director's flight into the witness protection program in the United States was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary.
Technical reasons were claimed -- and debunked by WADA investigators -- for why the data appeared to have been edited shortly before the delayed handover in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia are banned from all international sport for next four years over doping failures... but they could still farcically be allowed to compete at Qatar 2022 as 'NEUTRALS'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia have been banned from the world’s top sporting events for four years, including next summer’s Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Qatar World Cup, for tampering with doping tests.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee acted after concluding that Moscow had planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests in laboratory data that could have helped identify drug cheats.
‘For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,’ said WADA president Craig Reedie, adding that Russia’s actions had demanded a robust response.
But it emerged that the Russian football team will be permitted to take part in World Cup qualifiers next year and, if successful, is likely to compete in the 2022 tournament under a neutral flag despite the four-year ban.
FIFA would only say on Monday that it is ‘in contact with WADA to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football’.
But it is understood the world governing body are set to apply the same rationale that enabled 30 Russian athletes to compete at this year’s World Athletics Championships as ‘Authorized Neutral Athletes’ even though the country have been banned from the sport since 2015 for their state-sponsored doping programme.
Russia’s national side will suffer the embarrassment of being forced to compete as a neutral team four years after hosting a World Cup in which they reached the quarter-finals. They will be prevented from playing the national anthem and using their national flag during Qatar 2022 but the players will not be punished by exclusion.
There will be no restrictions at all during the qualifying process, as that is regarded as a regional tournament run by UEFA.
As a result of that distinction Russia will also be able to compete at Euro 2020, with St Petersburg one of 12 host cities in the first pan-European tournament, as UEFA is not deemed a ‘major event organisation’ with regard to rulings on anti-doping breaches.
The decision to ban Russia was made unanimously at a meeting of WADA’s executive committee in Lausanne on Monday, but the anomalies which will allow athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal to compete at the Tokyo Olympics under a neutral flag were widely criticised.
The ruling follows a judgement in September when Russia’s Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data of drug tests handed over to WADA investigators in January 2019.
The International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee welcomed the decision that is likely to result in them inviting Russian athletes to compete as neutrals in Tokyo next year. RUSADA have been given 21 days to appeal the ban, which would be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
However, WADA vice-president Linda Helleland said the ban was insufficient as Russian athletes and national teams will still be able to compete.
A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at last year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned following the 2014 Games, which it hosted in Sochi.
‘I wanted sanctions that cannot be watered down,’ said Helleland. ‘We owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible.’
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency behind the four-year ban given to Mo Farah’s former coach Alberto Salazar for doping violations earlier this year, said WADA’s decision proved the system was flawed and called for a blanket ban on Russian athletes.
‘To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law,’ said Tygart.
‘In turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.’
Whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian anti-doping official who fled to the United States after his allegations about a state-sponsored doping programme, said in a statement: ‘Finally, fraud, lies and falsifications of unspeakable proportions have been punished in full swing.
‘Those involved in the corruption of certain sports such as track and field, weightlifting, skiing, biathlon and bobsled should be punished retroactively. The results of the London and Sochi Olympic Games should be reanalysed with the new knowledge available today.
‘We only have a few months to reanalyse the samples from the 2012 London Games because according to Wada rules, we only have eight years to review.
‘There is a whole generation of clean athletes who have painfully abandoned their dreams and lost awards because of Russian cheaters. We need to take the strongest action to bring justice.’
Rodchenkov said ‘doped athletes do not work alone’ with ‘medical doctors, coaches and managers’ providing substances, advising and protecting them.
He added: ‘In Russia’s state-sponsored doping scheme, there is also a state-sponsored defence of many cheaters including state officials, witnesses and apparatchiks who are lying under oath and have falsified evidence.’
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev complained that the ban was the result of anti-Russian hysteria in a strong indication that RUSADA are planning to appeal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia hit with four-year Olympic and World Cup ban over doping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia was banished from the Olympics and other international competitions for four years on Monday over a persistent doping scandal, a decision that also threatens to turn President Vladimir Putin and top Kremlin officials into global sporting pariahs.
The World Anti-Doping Agency banned Russia’s national team after officials in Moscow were accused of fabricating evidence to cover up the use of banned substances by the country’s athletes. Individual athletes who comply with strict conditions will be allowed to compete under a neutral flag, while WADA ordered a ban on Russian government officials or representatives attending events.
The measures were “approved unanimously,” WADA said after a meeting of its executive committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, according to Russia’s state-run Tass news service. Russia can appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days.
The punishment means Russia will be kept out of next year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and the 2022 soccer World Cup in Qatar. The ban may also prevent Russia hosting matches in the UEFA Euro 2020 soccer championships next summer, for which the national team has qualified. Russia will also be barred from bidding to host any major championships during the four-year period, extending to include the 2032 Summer Olympics.
Test Anomalies
WADA’s decision followed recommendations last month from its compliance review committee after experts found anomalies in drug test results recovered from a Moscow laboratory in January, under an agreement in September 2018 to lift a previous three-year ban imposed over Russia’s state-backed doping program. The Russian anti-doping chief Yuriy Ganus, who has backed the tough international response, said thousands of doping tests were deleted or modified and he blamed influential former athletes for the deception.
The penalties are a humiliation for Putin, who personally oversaw the spending of tens of billions of dollars to host the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 soccer World Cup as part of his efforts to restore Russia’s Soviet-era image as a sporting superpower. After placing first in the medals table at Sochi, the most expensive Winter Games in history, Russia has since been stripped of 13 of its 33 medals as the scale of its doping program at the games emerged.
Russian track and field athletes were subsequently barred from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. At the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the Olympic flag.
The Kremlin denies the doping allegations, denouncing what it says is an anti-Russian campaign. But the International Olympic Committee has backed WADA, describing the test tampering as a “flagrant manipulation” that is an “attack on the credibility of sport.”
An independent investigation commissioned by WADA found in 2016 that Russian sports officials oversaw a vast program to manipulate doping test results from 2011 to 2015, and that athletes’ positive urine samples were swapped out during the Sochi Olympics.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia to miss Tokyo 2020 Olympics after four-year ban from major sporting events by Wada</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned Russia from global sporting events, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, after accusing Moscow of falsifying data from an anti-doping laboratory.
The ban means that Russia will not be allowed to compete at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and football’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar, according to a report by BBC Sport.
Not only will Russia be ruled out of the next Olympic cycle, but Russian government officials will be barred from attending any major events, while the country will lose the right to host, or even bid, for tournaments.
“Wada’s executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years,” Wada spokesman James Fitzgerald said.
Under the sanctions, Russian sportsmen and women will still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what Wada believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
“They are going to have prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation,” Fitzgerald said.
The independent report by Richard McLaren, released in 2016, revealed the significant extent of state-sponsored doping in Russia, notably between 2011 and 2015.
It led to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations of a vast state-supported doping programme.
Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia’s controversial reinstatement by Wada in September 2018.
The Wada decision was widely predicted, with the body’s president, Craig Reedie, having made a presentation Saturday to the Olympic Summit, participants of which “strongly condemned those responsible for the manipulation of the data from the Moscow laboratory”.
“It was agreed that this was an attack on sport and that these actions should lead to the toughest sanctions against those responsible,” the IOC said in a statement.
“It was stressed by the participants that full justice must be finally done so that the guilty ones can be properly punished and the innocent ones are fully protected.”
The IOC asked that the Russian authorities deliver the “fully authenticated raw data”.
Former Wada president Dick Pound, who chaired the commission that in 2015 made damning accusations of mass doping in Russian athletics, said Moscow had this time gone “too far”.
“The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer,” Pound told AFP.
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia – which in recent years hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the football World Cup in 2018 – “on many levels” in the sporting world.
“On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it’s among the sporting giants, so that’s influential,” he said.
“It’s (also) influential because Russia hosts and is willing to host many competitions for international federations, especially those who don’t have much money of their own, so they have a considerable influence among the international federations.
“And they’ve been quite strategic about making sure that they get Russians into positions on international federations. So they have an impact from inside as well as from outside.”
A majority of Wada’s influential athlete committee had called overnight for a “complete ban on Russian participation”, nine members of the 17-strong group saying such a move was “the only meaningful sanction”.
“We maintain that the fraud, manipulation and deception revealed to date will only be encouraged and perpetuated with a lesser response,” they said.
“To date, the Russian doping saga has dominated three Olympic and Paralympic Games, with a fourth on the horizon. Russia’s ongoing and intentional acts of deception, fraud and corruption have made a mockery not only those who play by the rules, but those who create and safeguard them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">World Anti-Doping Agency imposes 4-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — Russia was slapped Monday with a four-year ban from international sports events, including next summer’s Tokyo Olympics, over a longstanding doping scandal, although its athletes will still be able to compete if they can show they are clean competitors.
The ruling by the World Anti-Doping Agency’s executive committee means that Russia’s flag, name and anthem will not appear at the Tokyo Games, and the country also could be stripped of hosting world championships in Olympic sports.
The sanctions are the harshest punishment yet for Russian state authorities who were accused of tampering with a Moscow laboratory database. Russia’s anti-doping agency can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days — an action it has signaled it would take.
Russian athletes will be allowed to compete in major events only if they are not implicated in positive doping tests or if their data was not manipulated, according to the WADA ruling.
For soccer’s 2022 World Cup, WADA said the Russian team will play under its name in the qualifying program in Europe. If it qualifies for Qatar, the name will have be changed to something neutral that likely would not include the word “Russia.”
Legal fallout from the WADA ruling seems sure to dominate preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which open on July 24.
Evidence shows that Russian authorities tampered with a Moscow laboratory database to hide hundreds of potential doping cases and falsely shift the blame onto whistleblowers, WADA investigators and the International Olympic Committee said last month.
“Flagrant manipulation” of the Moscow lab data was “an insult to the sporting movement worldwide,” the IOC said last month.
WADA’s inability to fully expel Russia from the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games frustrated the doping watchdog’s vice president.
“I’m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,” said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian lawmaker who serves on WADA executive committee and has long pushed for a tougher line against Russia. “This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologize on all the pain all the athletes and sports fans have experienced.”
Handing over a clean database to WADA was a key requirement for Russia to help bring closure to a scandal that has tainted the Olympics over the last decade.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia are set to miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulation of laboratory data after the doping scandal that has rocked sport. Their executive committee concluded Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify cheats. The WADA board convened for a special meeting on Monday close to the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and ruled unanimously in favour of the global ban.

It is the most severe punishment yet connected to the cheating scheme, which peaked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The punishments come four years after details of the doping scheme were made public, with specific bans on Russian sports and government officials which prohibits the country from hosting international events. Russia could still contest the decision and look set to do so as it continues to deny many allegations despite several independent investigations finding wrongdoing. Officials from the country have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but if unsuccessful then they face missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the Olympics in Tokyo 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA executive committee bans Russia from Olympics, world championships for 4 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports for four years on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, a WADA spokesman said.
WADA's executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats.
The WADA committee's decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, the spokesman said.
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Russia's doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.
Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.
The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA's executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.

Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.
The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA’s executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia banned from Olympics and World Cup for doping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia has been banned from major international sports events for four years by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in the latest development in the years-long doping scandal which has seen the country stripped of 30 medals since 2008.
The ban was imposed by WADA’s Executive Committee at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday. The 12-member committee's decision was unanimous.
The ruling comes after the WADA's compliance committee found "Moscow data was intentionally altered prior to and while it was being forensically copied by WADA in January 2019."
The ban means the Russian flag and anthem will not be allowed at major events like the 2020 Olympics to be held in Tokyo as well as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Russia hosted the last World Cup in 2018.
WADA President Sir Craig Reedie said Russia had missed its chance to get its house in order.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport," Sir Craig said.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial."
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts."
Russia must pay WADA's costs incurred since January 2019 plus the lower of either a fine of 10 per cent or USD $100,000 within four years.
Russia has 21 days to appeal.
Russian athletes who are untainted by the country's years-long doping scandal can still compete but may not represent the Russian Federation.
Jonathan Taylor from the compliance committee said a blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing would be unfair.
"While I understand the calls for a blanket ban on all Russian athletes whether or not they are implicated by the data, it was the unanimous view ... that ... those who could prove their innocence should not be punished," Taylor said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shocking! World Anti-Doping Agency bans Russia from Tokyo Olympics, World Cup Football in Qatar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a huge blow to Russia’s future sporting ambition, the World Anti-Doping Agency, also known as WADA, on Monday banned the country from taking part in all major sporting events such as the next year’s Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Football World Cup scheduled to be held in Qatar for the next four years.
The WADA, however, said that the Russian athletes can still part in these competitions if they are able to demonstrate that they have been untainted. These athletes, if allowed, will have to take part under neutral flags.
Taking the remarkable decision unanimously in Lausanne in Switzerland, Wada’s executive committee handed out a four-year ban to Russia. This came months after the WADA declared the Russian anti-doping body non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.
Rusada boss Yuri Ganus, according to BBC, has since confirmed that someone altered or deleted ‘thousands’ of entries.
Russia may also be barred from hosting or bidding for or be granted the right to host any major events for four years, during the ban period. Russia may also not be allowed to bid for the right to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, irrespective of whether the bidding takes place during or after the four-year period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BREAKING: Russia banned from all major sporting events for four years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia are set to miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulation of laboratory data after the doping scandal that has rocked sport. Their executive committee concluded Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify cheats. The WADA board convened for a special meeting on Monday close to the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and ruled unanimously in favour of the global ban.

It is the most severe punishment yet connected to the cheating scheme, which peaked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The punishments come four years after details of the doping scheme were made public, with specific bans on Russian sports and government officials which prohibits the country from hosting international events. Russia could still contest the decision and look set to do so as it continues to deny many allegations despite several independent investigations finding wrongdoing. Officials from the country have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but if unsuccessful then they face missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the Olympics in Tokyo 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia banned from major sporting events for four years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency has voted unanimously to ban Russia from international sport for four years for doping offences.
Russia now have 21 days to appeal against the sentence, which would see the country banned from participating at next summer’s Olympics in Tokyo and the Qatar 2022 World Cup.
They will, however, still be able compete in next year’s European football championships, where they will also be one of the host countries. As for the World Cup, Fifa said it was in discussions with Wada “to clarify the extent of the decision”. Individual Russian athletes will furthermore be able to compete under a neutral banner at the Olympics, providing they can prove they are drug free. Under similar conditions, 30 Russians competed at this year’s World Athletics Championships as “Authorized Neutral Athletes”.
The new punishment was agreed by Wada’s executive committee (ExCo) at a special meeting convened at the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland. It is the most severe sanction yet against the country, which has been accused of running a systemic doping programme and deleting crucial laboratory evidence.
Wada’s president Sir Craig Reedie said: “For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
“As a result, the Wada ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.”
Some within Wada were more critical of the decision, saying it fell short of the ultimate sanction of a blanket ban for Russia and its athletes.
“I’m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,” said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian politician who is the Wada vice-president and a vocal critic of Russian doping.
”This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologise [FOR]all the pain athletes and sports fans have experienced.”
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of Usada who had previously said anything but a blanket ban on all Russia athletes would be “inadequate”, said Wada’s decision proved the system was flawed. “To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law,” Tygart said. “And, in turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.”
Russian authorities have strongly criticised the decision. The country’s ruling party described the ban as “politicised” and the deputy speaker of Russia’s parliament called it “a way of ousting Russian competitors from global sports.”
The head of Russia’s biathlon federation, Vladimir Drachev, called the decision “extremely wrong and biased” during a live interview broadcast on Russian state television. “Much has been done in Russian sport recently, athletes have undergone tests for doping, all the cases [OF DOPING]in Russia are part of the past.”
Evidence of wide-spread Russian doping was first revealed by Wada four years ago with a report claiming that at least 643 positive tests had been hidden by authorities. That resulted in the suspension of the Russian Athletics Federation (Rusaf) and 111 individual athletes being banned from the 2016 games in Rio.
Last year Wada made the controversial decision to reinstate the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) on the condition that it complied with requests to share its laboratory results. Those results were subsequently found to have been tampered with, and led to renewed calls for punishment. “Flagrant manipulation” of the Moscow lab data was “an insult to the sporting movement worldwide,” the IOC said last month.
If Russia, as is likely, does choose to appeal the punishment, it will subsequently be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In a statement, the UK anti-doping body Ukad called for any appeal to be heard as quickly as possible.
“This was the only possible outcome that the WADA ExCo could take to reassure athletes and the public and continue the task of seeking justice for those cheated b Russian athletes”, said Ukad ’s chief executive Nicole Sapstead.
“We know however that this is not necessarily the end of the matter. If RUSADA choose to appeal this decision to CAS, this must be carried out with minimal delay, especially in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.” - Guardian

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia's four-year ban from all major sporting events branded as 'not enough' by WADA vice-president</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia has been banned from the 2020 Olympics and the 2022 football World Cup.
The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday confirmed a four-year ban from all major global sporting events, after considering recommendations from its independent compliance review committee (CRC) that Russia had manipulated laboratory doping data.
However, WADA's vice-president Linda Helleland said the ban was "not enough".
"I wanted sanctions that can not be watered down," she said. "We owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible."
The judgement means Russia will be banned from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar.
WADA said the decision was unanimous and its president Craig Reedie accused Russia of choosing "deception and denial" rather than getting its house in order.
Russia has 21 days to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, while individual Russian athletes untainted by the scandal will be able to compete independently under a neutral flag.
Reedie said: "The ExCo's (executive committee) strong decision today shows WADA's determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis, thanks to the agency's robust investigatory capability, the vision of the CRC, and WADA's recently acquired ability to recommend meaningful sanctions via the compliance standard which entered into effect in April 2018.
"Combined, these strengths have enabled the ExCo to make the right decisions at the right time.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA's reinstatement conditions, approved by the ExCo in September 2018, demanded a robust response.
"That is exactly what has been delivered today. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and rejoin the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.
"On behalf of the ExCo, and of the many WADA stakeholders that supported the CRC recommendation, I would like to thank the members of the CRC for their expert and considered recommendation, as well as WADA I&I and the forensic experts for their skill, diligence and perseverance in getting to the bottom of this highly complex case."
However, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 next summer, having qualified for an event that will see some games take place in St Petersburg.
European football's governing body does not fall under the definition of a Major Events Organisation under the international compliance code.
The CRC made its recommendations based on evidence presented to it by WADA's intelligence and investigations (I&I) team.
The I&I team found there were inconsistencies in data handed over to WADA in January 2019 by Russia under the terms of its reinstatement to compliance in September 2018.
The data provided was inconsistent with a copy of the database supplied to WADA by a whistleblower in 2017, in that positive findings present in 2017 were missing from the 2019 data.
The I&I team found that some of the manipulation and deletion had occurred as recently as December 2018 and January 2019 - after reinstatement.
Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015 when it was first declared non-compliant.
UK Anti-Doping welcomed the ban on Russia in a statement by saying it was the "only possible outcome".
UKAD chief executive Nicole Sapstead said: "We welcome today's decision to declare RUSADA non-compliant, and the decisive action by WADA's executive committee to impose four-year sanctions on Russian athletes and support personnel.
"This was the only possible outcome that the WADA ExCo could take to reassure athletes and the public and continue the task of seeking justice for those cheated by Russian athletes.
"We know however that this is not necessarily the end of the matter. If RUSADA choose to appeal this decision to CAS, this must be carried out with minimal delay, especially in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.
"We welcome the clear and detailed communication from WADA today which is vital in helping to maintain confidence in the global anti-doping system."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arlene Foster accuses PM of breaking his word over Brexit deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUP leader says Boris Johnson has betrayed unionist voters in Northern Ireland
Boris Johnson has been accused of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, three days before the general election
The Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, said the prime minister betrayed unionist voters in Northern Ireland when he sealed a deal with the EU that would introduce a trade barrier down the Irish Sea, contrary to a personal promise he had made when he spoke at their annual conference last year.
It meant the party could no longer take Johnson at his word. Foster said in future the party, if returned to Westminster, would have to check if what he said “was actually factually correct”.
She added: “Once bitten, twice shy, we will certainly be looking for the detail of what this [Brexit] is going to look like,”
Her comments put Johnson on notice once again that his Brexit deal is under threat if a hung parliament is returned on Thursday and the DUP’s votes hold the balance of power.
When Johnson announced his deal in October, the DUP was told by HM Revenue & Customs that it would entail new checks on goods, Foster told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“We asked them a number of questions on goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB, and they were very clear with us that all of the goods would have to be checked. Of course, only the goods going to Republic of Ireland would have tariffs, but that would be the default position,” she said.
Her comments came as a freshly leaked document, written by officials in the government’s Brexit department, warns that Johnson’s aim to implement his deal by the end of 2020 presents a major challenge because of the need to create new protocols and systems for business in Northern Ireland.
The document, obtained by the Financial Times, claims that 98% of export businesses are “likely to struggle to bear the cost” of the extra paperwork, fuelling concerns of increased prices for consumers.
The government dismissed a similar document leaked to the Labour party on Friday as instant analysis done when Johnson brought home his Brexit deal in October.
The further document leaked to the FT over the weekend raises doubts that the new controls for Northern Ireland could be in place by the end of 2020, when Johnson pledges to have completed his exit deal
The Department for Exiting the EU document was circulated last week and warns that in order to meet the December deadline, “delivery on the ground” of the new protocols and systems would have to take place before officials know the outcome of the next stage of negotiations.
“Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge,” it said.
With three days to go until the election, the Conservative party has stuck rigidly to its claim, with the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, saying on Monday morning there would be no checks.
Only a month ago, Johnson told businesses in Northern Ireland he was so sure there would be no checks and that if they got any forms they could “throw them in the bin”.
Foster was asked how it felt to be hailing Johnson as “the saviour of the union” one moment and then for him to do a deal that her party believes is “betraying the union”. “I think it says more about who broke their word than me and the leadership of the unionist party,” she said.
On Sky News on Sunday, Johnson went so far as to say a leaked Treasury document claims by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, that exit declaration forms would be required on goods from Northern Ireland to GB were “wrong”.
Pressed on the document stating there would be “checks both ways”, Johnson said: “That’s wrong because there won’t be checks”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DUP accuses Boris Johnson of breaking his word on union commitment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PM is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands as the election campaign enters its final few days.
Boris Johnson has been accused of breaking his word over his commitment to protect the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
As the Prime Minister faced fresh questions over trade within the UK after Brexit, Arlene Foster said Government officials had told her there would need to be checks.
Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about the sense of some in the unionist community that Mr Johnson’s deal was a “betrayal”, she said: “I think it is right for the leadership of unionism in Northern Ireland to try to work with the prime minister of the day to get the best deal for Northern Ireland.
“We will always do that. We will continue to do that. I think it says more about the person who broke their word than me and the leadership of the… Democratic Unionist Party.”
She said the DUP had been told by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials before the PM announced his deal that there would be checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland.
Mrs Foster said a lack of free-flowing trade would cause “economic instability in Northern Ireland, which will lead to higher costs for retailers which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland”.
“And all of that leads me to say that we need to – after this election is over, and I’m not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count – but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland.”
Mrs Foster has kept a low profile in the election campaign thus far, and her intervention will be seen by some as an attempt to highlight a need for the DUP’s role in holding sway in the event of a hung parliament.
Her comments came after Labour released a leaked Treasury report last week that concluded customs checks and possibly even tariffs could be required on goods travelling in both directions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But Mr Johnson told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme over the weekend that the report was “wrong” and added that the six counties would have “unfettered access” to the UK market.
With just a few days to go until polls open, the PM is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands in a bid to convince Leave voters that Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position is akin to a “great betrayal”, and will say there are just “three days to get Brexit done”.
He has consistently vowed to take the UK out of the EU by January 31 and then finalise a trade deal with Brussels within 11 months to meet the transition period deadline.
Arrangements would also need to be signed off that allow Northern Ireland to continue to follow Brussels and Dublin rules on the trade of goods to ensure there is no hard border.
But a Whitehall report seen by the Financial Times highlights the difficultly involved for the Government in bringing in the infrastructure in time for the UK to leave when the PM has pledged.
A Department for Exiting the European Union document, according to the FT, states that: “Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the (Northern Ireland) protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.”
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will set out his party’s main priorities for the first 100 days of a Labour government.
He will say that the first priority for the Treasury under Labour will be ending the Conservatives’ programme of cuts to public spending and social security.
“In our first hundred days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership,” he will say.
“We’ll set up boards to run them made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.
“We’ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services – those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before.
“So you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we’ll create new People’s Assemblies to hold these boards to account and give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run.”

She said the DUP had been told by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials before the PM announced his deal that there would be checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland.
Mrs Foster said a lack of free-flowing trade would cause “economic instability in Northern Ireland, which will lead to higher costs for retailers which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland”.
“And all of that leads me to say that we need to – after this election is over, and I’m not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count – but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland.”
Mrs Foster has kept a low profile in the election campaign thus far, and her intervention will be seen by some as an attempt to highlight a need for the DUP’s role in holding sway in the event of a hung parliament.
Her comments came after Labour released a leaked Treasury report last week that concluded customs checks and possibly even tariffs could be required on goods travelling in both directions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But Mr Johnson told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme over the weekend that the report was “wrong” and added that the six counties would have “unfettered access” to the UK market.
With just a few days to go until polls open, the PM is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands in a bid to convince Leave voters that Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position is akin to a “great betrayal”, and will say there are just “three days to get Brexit done”.
He has consistently vowed to take the UK out of the EU by January 31 and then finalise a trade deal with Brussels within 11 months to meet the transition period deadline.
Arrangements would also need to be signed off that allow Northern Ireland to continue to follow Brussels and Dublin rules on the trade of goods to ensure there is no hard border.
But a Whitehall report seen by the Financial Times highlights the difficultly involved for the Government in bringing in the infrastructure in time for the UK to leave when the PM has pledged.
A Department for Exiting the European Union document, according to the FT, states that: “Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the (Northern Ireland) protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.”
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will set out his party’s main priorities for the first 100 days of a Labour government.
He will say that the first priority for the Treasury under Labour will be ending the Conservatives’ programme of cuts to public spending and social security.
“In our first hundred days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership,” he will say.
“We’ll set up boards to run them made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.
“We’ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services – those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before.
“So you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we’ll create new People’s Assemblies to hold these boards to account and give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Once bitten twice shy': Arlene Foster warns Boris Johnson he may not be able to count on DUP support after the election as she demands written guarantees there will not be customs checks between the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arlene Foster has warned Boris Johnson he may not be able to count on the DUP's support unless he provides them with cast iron guarantees there will not be customs checks between the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit.  
Mr Johnson said yesterday that 'there's no question of there being checks on goods' travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK or the other way around. 
But there is growing confusion over whether that would be the case with suggestions that the Prime Minister's Brexit deal would see checks carried out on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. 
Ms Foster said today her party would continue to oppose the premier's divorce accord as she said Mr Johnson's statements were not enough to win the DUP's support. 
She suggested her party would need something in writing to confirm Mr Johnson's claims before it would consider backing another Tory government as she accused the PM of breaking his word on Brexit.  
Mr Johnson had stood alongside the DUP leadership at the Conservative Party's annual conference in October and stressed the importance of the Union. 
But the DUP believe Mr Johnson effectively sacrificed the Union in order to secure a deal with Brussels which the party believes will see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK. 
Asked this morning if she would take Mr Johnson at his word, Ms Foster told the BBC: 'I think once bitten twice shy we will certainly be looking for the detail of what this is going to look like. 
'That is why in the week leading up to the deal we were engaged with trade officials, we were engaged with officials from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to make sure that what was being said was actually factually correct. 
'We will continue to do that.'
Opinion polls suggest Mr Johnson is on course to win a majority at the general election on Thursday. 
But should the polls narrow and the PM fail to win a majority then the DUP and its likely handful of MPs could be key to whether he is able to stay in power. 
But as it stands the party is adamant that it cannot support Mr Johnson's Brexit agreement.    
Ms Foster said: 'It is very important for us in Northern Ireland not just to have the word but to have the detail. 
'We want to see the detail. We did see the detail of that week when we spoke to HMRC officials and they said that this would be what would happen, that there would be checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland, something which will cause economic instability in Northern Ireland which will lead to higher costs for retailers, which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland. 
'All of that leads me to say that we need to, after this election is over, and I am not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count, but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland. 
'Because in the event of a hung Parliament or in the event even of a small majority for a Conservative leader we will be wanting clarity and we will be wanting to make sure that we deal with this customs issue.'
It came as a leaked government document suggested delivering the customs arrangements related to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit relationship with the UK by December 2020 would be a 'major challenge'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EU approves 3.2 billion euro state aid for battery research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission approved on Monday 3.2 billion euros ($3.53 billion) of state aid from seven European Union countries for research and innovation in battery technology.
The approval is for projects in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden to support research and innovation in the common European priority area of batteries.
The 3.2 billion euro in public funding, is expected to unlock an additional 5 billion euro in private investments. The completion of the overall project is planned for 2031.
“Battery production in Europe is of strategic interest for our economy and society because of its potential in terms of clean mobility and energy, job creation, sustainability and competitiveness,” said Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President responsible for competition.
“The approved aid will ensure that this important project can go ahead without unduly distorting competition,” she said.
The Commission said the project involved “ambitious and risky” research and development across the batteries value chain, from mining and processing the raw materials, production of advanced chemical materials, the design of battery cells and modules and their integration into smart systems, to the recycling and repurposing of used batteries.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EU unveils €3bn research fund to develop batteries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The EU has approved a €3.2bn fund to promote the research and development of batteries as it targets strategic areas in which to help European companies develop new technology to keep up with global competition.
Seven EU countries — Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden — will provide funding of up to €3.2bn for the project, set to be completed by 2031. The European Commission said it expected a further €5bn in private investment.
Announcing the initiative on Monday, Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of promoting technology in Europe and the EU’s competition commissioner, said: “Battery production in Europe is of strategic interest for our economy and society because of its potential in terms of clean mobility and energy, job creation, sustainability and competitiveness.”
She added: “The approved aid will ensure that this important project can go ahead without unduly distorting competition.”
Maros Sefcovic, vice-president for interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: “Thanks to intensive efforts by seven member states, industry and the commission, Europe’s first major pan-European battery ecosystem is emerging, with lead projects in all segments of this strategic value chain.”
The plan will involve 17 direct participants, mostly industrial actors, including small and medium-sized businesses, the commission said. Representatives from the member states will monitor the project.
Peter Altmaier, Germany’s economic affairs minister, called it “a big success for Germany and Europe as a destination for investments in the auto industry”.
He added: “We want to produce the most innovative and sustainable batteries in Germany and Europe and so secure added value and jobs in Europe. That is why we are pursuing a comprehensive approach with our concept, from material to production to recycling. Now it’s up to us to get concrete projects off the ground.”

Mr Altmaier said German companies BASF, BMW, Opel, and Varta were involved in the initiative, which he called “the first success of an ambitious European industrial policy”.
Chemicals group BASF will contribute battery materials. BMW will be involved in developing the chemical composition, cell mechanism, cell designs and the production process.
Carmaker Opel will set up a joint venture with its French parent PSA and the French battery producer Saft to produce innovative battery cells in Kaiserslautern in south-west Germany.
The plan is for Germany to produce battery cells on an industrial scale by the mid-2020s at the latest.
Separately, Ms Vestager said EU regulators would review 20-year-old rules defining market power for companies to take into account advances in technology and a more globalised economy.
Speaking at the Chillin Competition Conference in Brussels, she said: “Changes like globalisation and digitisation mean that many markets work rather differently from the way they did 22 years ago.
“So the time has come to review the market definition notice. We want to be sure that the guidance it gives is accurate and up to date, and sets out a clear and consistent approach to both antitrust and merger cases across different industries, in a way that’s easily accessible,” she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timothy Ginter, who said he had ‘no knowledge’ of Project Blitz, was listed as co-chair of state branch of group behind the campaign
An Ohio legislator who said he had “no knowledge” of a rightwing Christian bill mill called Project Blitz is, in fact, the co-chair of the state branch of an organization behind the campaign.
The Ohio state representative Timothy Ginter sponsored a bill called the Student Religious Liberties Act. Opponents argued the bill would provide students with a religious exemption to facts, and would frighten teachers and school administrators into including religion in school functions.
The Guardian revealed the bill was nearly identical to one promoted by Project Blitz, a state legislative project guided by three Christian right organizations, including the Congressional Prayer Caucus (CPC), WallBuilders and the ProFamily Legislators Conference. Project Blitz aims to promote and help pass conservative legislation across the US to fulfil its rightwing Christian agenda.
When initially approached, Ginter told the Guardian in an email from a legislative aide that he had “no knowledge of ‘Project Blitz’ and has not been working with WallBuilders or the Congressional Prayer Caucus”.
However, a screenshot shows Ginter was listed as the co-chair of the Ohio Prayer Caucus, the state chapter of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, as recently as January 2019. Ginter’s former chief of staff, Chris Albanese, is currently listed as the state director of the state chapter of CPC, Ohio Prayer Caucus.
“I would call it an outright lie,” said Frederick Clarkson, a senior research analyst with Political Research Associates, and an expert on the Christian right. “The Prayer Caucus in the states are the action arm of Project Blitz – it is Project Blitz,” he said. “When he told you, ‘I’ve never heard of Project Blitz,’ that was a lie,” said Clarkson.
The Guardian repeatedly called and emailed both Ginter and the the Republican Ohio house speaker, Larry Householder. Neither responded to these phone or email requests.
In a statement at the time, Ginter argued the bill was necessary because, “well-funded groups” were intimidating school officials with “the thread of litigation”. His bill, he argued, would clarify their responsibilities.
Ginter also argued the Student Religious Liberties Bill was not a Christian bill, because it does not explicitly mention Christianity. However, the Ohio Prayer Caucus he co-chaired explicitly lays out that it support legislators “who are standing for faith, morality and Judeo-Christian principles”.
The Congressional Prayer Caucus also circulated an Ohio Prayer Proclamation. Among its signers are Ginter; the former representative Bill Hayes, who originally sponsored the bill; and the former House speaker Cliff Rosenberger. Rosenberger resigned in 2018 after a search warrant and subpoena revealed the FBI was investigating Rosenberger for corruption involving three payday lending representatives, according to the Dayton Daily News.
Prominent defenders of religious liberties, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League, oppose the legislation. Republicans in the Ohio House passed the legislation with a party-line vote in November. It has not yet been taken up by the Ohio senate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sanna Marin of Finland to Become World’s Youngest Prime Minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HELSINKI, Finland — Sanna Marin, 34, is set to become the world’s youngest sitting prime minister when she is sworn in this week in Finland, after being elected to the position by her party late Sunday.
The country’s coalition government consists of five parties, four of which are led by women, with Ms. Marin now at the helm. Four of the women are under the age of 35, which Finnish political experts say is more significant, symbolic of the rise of a new generation of politicians in the Nordic nation, which has had strong female representation for decades.
“The past week has been extraordinary,” she told reporters, according to Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper. “Now is the time to look ahead. What is needed now is action beyond words to build trust from all government parties.”
Formerly the country’s transportation minister, Ms. Marin was voted in by fellow lawmakers in her Social Democratic Party after a turbulent week in which Prime Minister Antti Rinne resigned over his handling of a postal workers strike.
Although Mr. Rinne will continue as head of the party, Parliament is expected to confirm Ms. Marin as prime minister as soon as Tuesday, depending on how quickly the other coalition parties name their ministers. Once sworn in, she will be Finland’s youngest prime minister to date and its third female prime minister.
Ms. Marin, a left-leaning liberal, has been a member of Parliament since 2015. She began her political career in 2012, when she was elected to the local council in the southern city of Tampere. Most recently she was minister of transportation and communications in Mr. Rinne’s government.
Serving as Mr. Rinne’s deputy when he took an extended sick leave earlier this year, she helped lead their party to a narrow win in national elections.
Alexander Stubb, who was Finland’s prime minister from 2014 to 2015, posted on Twitter that having a government led by women “shows that #Finland is a modern and progressive country.”
“One day, gender will not matter in government,” he wrote. “Meanwhile pioneers.”
Of the five women in leading ministerial positions in the coalition, four are under 35. Asked about her age after it was announced that she would be prime minister, Ms. Marin reiterated what she has said numerous times: Age doesn’t matter.
“I have not actually ever thought about my age or my gender,” she said, according to the national news outlet YLE. “I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate.”
She outlined her political ethos in a letter to fellow party members ahead of the decision on Sunday, asking for their support. She noted that she had benefited from the welfare state throughout her life, especially during “difficult times” and said that ensuring its strength was a priority for her.
“I got to live a safe childhood, have an education and pursue my dreams,” she wrote. “Enabling it for everyone has driven me into politics.”
While Ms. Marin’s new role has drawn attention globally, Anne Holli, a political science professor at the University of Helsinki, said it was unsurprising, in Finland where women’s representation in Parliament has been strong for decades.
In the 1983 election, women held 30 percent of the seats. By the 2007 election, they made up more than 40 percent of lawmakers, and they make up 47 percent in the parliamentary term that began this year.
“We have actually a very broad base of women in politics, and we have had a pretty equal situation in the political sphere for more than 35 years,” Ms. Holli said. “I think one can kind of expect this sooner or later.”
She said the sudden attention to the young female lawmakers has been jarring. “Nobody has been calling me when there are young male party leaders,” she said.
Ms. Holli said it was the youth of Ms. Marin and her fellow government leaders that was unusual, rather than their gender.
“It’s kind of a change of generations,” she said.
Ms. Marin won the leadership vote by a small margin, and her skills will be put to the test immediately as the country heads into a season of labor negotiations with the potential for strikes. Her predecessor, Mr. Rinne, was ultimately forced out of office after he made comments about a plan to cut wages for postal workers and his coalition partner, the Center Party, said it had lost confidence in him.
Despite his resignation, the coalition’s parties will remain unaltered: Ms. Marin’s Social Democratic Party as Finland’s biggest, the Center Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland.
The Social Democratic Party will vote at its convention next June to determine whether Mr. Rinne will continue to lead the party or whether Ms. Marin or someone else will formally take over. Many analysts say Ms. Marin is likely to win the contest for party leadership.
The coalition government under Ms. Marin is expected to continue prioritizing job creation and ambitious climate goals, seeking to render Finland carbon neutral by 2035.
Tuomas Yla-Anttila, an associate professor of political science at the University of Helsinki said that Ms. Marin’s appointment as prime minister has symbolic value in the country, but is also a reflection of strides in gender equality.
“For a long time we had the situation in Finland where there were only men, now there are women, sometimes it goes the other way round,” he said, pointing to the all-female government leadership.
He said Ms. Marin’s youth likely helped her win the support of the troubled Social Democratic Party as it looks to reform and move away from the politics of Mr. Rinne. In Finland, he added, her age was a more important political factor than her sex.
“The party surely wanted a younger prime minister,” he said. “Her young age is more important than being a woman. She represents a new generation of politicians.”
Jenni Karimaki, a senior researcher at the Center for Parliamentary Studies at the University of Turku, said that in many ways Ms. Marin was a natural choice. She is the first deputy of the party and has served as a government minister, positions that traditionally have been springboards to the prime minister’s office.
“There is demand at the moment for young women in key positions,” Ms. Karimaki said, and pointed to the fact that many other young, female politicians won office in April’s national election.
Ms. Karimaki said Ms. Marin also symbolized the new start that the Social Democrats have been looking for and represented “a strengthening of representative democracy.”
“Now the picture is changing of what kind of people can bear high-level political responsibility,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India Steps Toward Making Naturalization Harder for Muslims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HYDERABAD, India — India took a major step toward the official marginalization of Muslims on Tuesday as one house of Parliament passed a bill that would establish a religious test for migrants who want to become citizens, solidifying Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.
The measure would give migrants of all of South Asia’s major religions a clear path to Indian citizenship — except Islam. It is the most significant move yet to profoundly alter India’s secular nature enshrined by its founding leaders when the country gained independence in 1947.
The bill passed in the lower house, the Lok Sabha, a few minutes after midnight, following a few hours of debate. The vote was 311 to 80. The measure now moves to the upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where Mr. Modi seems to have enough allies that most analysts predict it will soon become law.
Muslim Indians are deeply unsettled. They see the new measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, as the first step by the governing party to make second-class citizens of India’s 200 million Muslims, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and render many of them stateless.
“We are heading toward totalitarianism, a fascist state,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim lawmaker, who on Monday dramatically tore up a copy of the bill while giving a speech in Parliament. “We are making India a theocratic country.”
The legislation goes hand in hand with a contentious program that began in the northeastern state of Assam this year, in which all 33 million residents of the state had to prove, with documentary evidence, that they or their ancestors were Indian citizens. Approximately two million people — many of them Muslims, and many of them lifelong residents of India — were left off the state’s citizenship rolls after that exercise.
Now, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is hoping to expand that kind of citizenship test to other states. And the new legislation would become a guiding principle for who could hope to call themselves Indians.
Mr. Modi and his party are deeply rooted in an ideology that sees India as a Hindu nation. And since the B.J.P.’s landslide re-election win in May, Mr. Modi’s administration has celebrated one Hindu nationalist victory after another, each a demoralizing drumbeat for Muslims.
First came the Assam citizenship tests. Then Mr. Modi stripped away autonomy and statehood for Kashmir, which used to be India’s only Muslim-majority state. And last month, Hindu fundamentalists scored a big court victory allowing them to build a new temple over the ruins of a demolished mosque in the flash point city of Ayodhya.
With the new citizenship bill, Mr. Modi’s party says it is simply trying to protect persecuted Hindus, Buddhists and Christians (and members of a few smaller religions) who migrate from predominantly Muslim countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan.
But the legislation would also make it easier to incarcerate and deport Muslim residents, even those whose families have been in India for generations, if they cannot produce proof of citizenship.
Under Mr. Modi’s leadership, anti-Muslim sentiment has become blatantly more mainstream and public. Intimidation and attacks against Muslim communities have increased in recent years. And overt displays of Hindu piety and nationalism have become central in pop culture and politics.
Mr. Modi’s fellow lawmakers in the B.J.P. are unapologetic about their pro-Hindu position.
“There are Muslim countries, there are Jew countries, everybody has their own identity. And we are a billion-plus, right? We must have one identity,” said Ravi Kishan, a famous action-film hero and member of Parliament who is a central supporter of the citizenship legislation.
When asked if he was trying to turn India into a Hindu nation, he laughed. “India has always been a Hindu nation,” he said. “The Muslims also are Hindus.” (This is a common Hindu nationalist belief: that India’s Muslims are relatively recent converts, even though Islam arrived in India hundreds of years ago.)
Even before lawmakers in the Lok Sabha voted, protests were breaking out.
In Assam, where the citizenship program began last summer, thousands of people have marched in the streets, hoisting placards and torches and shouting out their opposition to the bill.
People are talking of mass fasts and boycotts of schools and markets. On Monday, some hanged effigies of Mr. Modi and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister.
The leaders of the opposition Indian National Congress party are trying to paint the bill as a danger to India’s democracy. After India won its independence, its founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru among them, made a clear decision: Even though the country was 80 percent Hindu, it would not be an officially Hindu nation. Minorities, especially Muslims, would be treated equally.
Rahul Gandhi, a party leader and great-grandson of Mr. Nehru, said, “India belongs to everybody — all communities, all religions, all cultures.” Shashi Tharoor, the party’s intellectual heavyweight, called the bill an “all-out assault on the very idea of India.”
But the Congress party is at a low point in its 100-year-plus history. And Mr. Modi’s party has the numbers: With allies, it controls nearly two-thirds of the seats in the lower house.
Some of Mr. Modi’s critics believe the bill is serving to distract the public from another pressing issue: the economy. For the first time in decades, India’s economy is slowing significantly. It is still huge, but several big industries, like car and motorcycle manufacturing, have seen sales plummet like never before.
“The economy is in tatters,” said Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer in Assam. The bill, he said, was “the only issue left to polarize the country and distract people.”
But forging India into an overtly Hindu nation has been a core goal of Mr. Modi’s party and of the R.S.S., a right-wing volunteer group whose ranks Mr. Modi rose up through and which provides him a backbone of support. And India’s recent moves in Kashmir, along with the Ayodhya temple ruling and the Assam citizenship tests, have been hugely popular with the prime minister’s base.
Earlier this year, Mr. Modi’s government tried to push similar citizenship legislation. The bill sailed through the lower house but stalled after many politicians in Assam said they did not like the religious dimension the B.J.P. was injecting — or the possibility that a large number of Hindu Bengalis would be made citizens and would be able to legally acquire land in Assam.
The bill gathered new momentum this fall, after the citizenship test in Assam. Assam has witnessed waves of migration over the years, and many of those people whose citizenship was being questioned were migrants, both Hindus and Muslims, from neighboring Bangladesh.
Mr. Shah, the home minister and architect of the B.J.P.’s recent political victories, promised to protect the Hindus and other non-Muslims. He has called illegal migrants from Bangladesh “termites,” and along with his other statements made clear that Muslims were his target. Mr. Shah has also promised to impose the citizenship test from Assam on the entire country.
The citizenship bill is a piece of the campaign to identify and deport Muslims who have been living in India for years, critics of the bill say. It lays out a path to Indian citizenship for migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they can prove they have been in India for at least five years and ascribe to the specified religions.
To overcome the resistance from politicians in Assam, who do not want Hindu or Muslim migrants taking their land, the new version of the bill carves out special protections for areas predominated by indigenous people.
Mr. Modi’s supporters employ a certain logic when defending the bill’s exclusion of Muslims. They say Muslims are not persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, which is mostly true. They also say that when India and Pakistan were granted independence in 1947, the British carved out Pakistan as a haven for Muslims, while India remained predominantly Hindu. To them, the extension of that process is to ask illegal Muslims migrants to leave India and seek refuge in neighboring, mainly Muslim nations.
Article 25 of the Indian Constitution says, “All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.” Given that, many opponents of the bill say the citizenship legislation is patently unconstitutional. But the Hindu nationalists have an answer for that, as well.
“We are not talking about citizens,” said Ramesh Shinde, a spokesman for the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, a Hindu organization that is considered a far-right group. “We are talking about migrants.”
Both sides agree on one thing: The bill could have far-reaching consequences.
The Indian government is already racing to build an enormous network of prisons to house thousands of migrants. If immigration law is applied selectively, Hindu migrants who are swept up in raids may be released and allowed to apply for citizenship, while Muslim migrants could instead be sent to detention camps, opponents say.
“In every state, Muslims are running around for papers,” said Mr. Wadud, the human rights lawyer in Assam. “An environment of fear has been created.”
Mr. Kishan, the action hero turned politician, said he would next push to change India’s name to Bharat, the traditional Hindi word for India. But he said that he was not anti-Muslim, and that Muslims living in India legally had nothing to fear.
“How can I be anti-Muslim? My staff in Mumbai is Muslim,” he said.
“Hindus and Muslims in India are like this,” he said, interlacing his fingers. “But,” he added with a big smile, “I love Hindus.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘The Ferrante Effect’: In Italy, Women Writers Are Ascendant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ROME — In Italy, literary fiction has long been considered a man’s game. Publishers, critics and prize committees have dismissed books by women as chick lit and beach reads. They scoffed at Elena Ferrante, the author of “My Brilliant Friend,” as the writer of mere page-turners.
Then Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels became an international sensation, selling over 11 million copies, inspiring an acclaimed HBO series and cementing her reputation as the most successful Italian novelist in years. Her ascent, and the rediscovery of some of the last century’s great Italian female writers, has encouraged a new wave of women and shaken the country’s literary establishment. Women writers here are winning prestigious prizes, getting translated and selling copies.
Their achievements have set off a wider debate in Italy about what constitutes literature in a country where self-referential virtuosity is often valued over storytelling, emotional resonance and issues like sexism or gender roles.
“Once we were more reluctant to write about certain topics, fearing they could be labeled as ‘women’s stuff,’” said Veronica Raimo, author of the novel “The Girl at the Door,” an exploration of marriage, pregnancy and sexual assault allegations that was translated into English this year. “There was this idea that stories told by women couldn’t be universal. But that’s changing.”
One author to see the progress firsthand is Helena Janeczek, who has been publishing for decades but who last year became the first woman in 15 years to win the Premio Strega, the country’s top literary award.
“That was quite a time gap, wasn’t it?” she said. “But I wasn’t that surprised. The times are changing.”
The book that won her the award, published in October in English as “The Girl With the Leica,” is a historical novel about the war photographer Gerda Taro, who was killed in 1937 while documenting the Spanish Civil War with her more famous boyfriend and colleague, Robert Capa.
In the past two years, novels by women have accounted for roughly half of Italy’s top 20 best sellers in fiction — nearly double the percentage from 2017, according to data released by Informazioni Editoriali, which surveys sales in the country’s bookshops.
In interviews, Italian authors, editors, critics, translators and publishers said that women writers have gained extraordinary attention. Some call it “the Ferrante effect.”
“My Brilliant Friend” and the other Ferrante novels (her latest, “La Vita Bugiarda Degli Adulti,” came out in Italian last month and is slated for publication in English as “The Lying Life of Adults” next year) showed that “there is a market for fiction by women,” said Daniela Brogi, a contemporary literature scholar at the University for Foreigners of Siena. “And they also gave literary dignity to fiction about women.”
Establishment critics were previously quick to disregard stories about the bonds between women. That has changed.
Three much-discussed recent books delve into mother-daughter relationships. Donatella Di Pietrantonio’s “A Girl, Returned,” released last summer in English, is a coming-of-age story set in rural Southern Italy. Claudia Durastanti’s “La Straniera” (“The Stranger”) recalls her upbringing in a dysfunctional family between Brooklyn and Basilicata. Nadia Terranova’s novel “Addio Fantasmi” (“Goodbye Ghosts”) tells the story of a 30-something woman facing her painful past on a trip home to see her mother. Both of those are being translated into English.
Raimo, the author of “The Girl at the Door,” said that younger readers in Italy have become more open to women writers partly as a result of having read women in translation.
“They know there are countries in which having someone like Jennifer Egan or Zadie Smith is normal,” she said.
But many of the new wave of women writers attribute their momentum to the pseudonymous Ferrante, who has guarded her anonymity even as her books have become best sellers. (Some people speculate that Ferrante could be Anita Raja, a prominent literary translator married to the novelist Domenico Starnone, and they have looked for evidence of his hand in her work.)
Beyond the guessing game, Ferrante has generated international interest in Italian writers overall.
“There’s a global buzz about contemporary Italian writers, including many women and even minorities, and we owe a lot to her for that,” said Igiaba Scego, a Somali-Italian writer. Her novel “Beyond Babylon,” which explores the traumas of the immigrant experience through the eyes of two women, was translated into English this year after being published in Italy a decade ago.
Some new translations of Italian works reach back even further.
A new English translation of “Family Lexicon,” the 1963 masterpiece by Natalia Ginzburg, came out in 2017. Three more of her novels were reissued this year, two of them in new translations. Another major writer from Italy’s postwar period, Elsa Morante (whom Ferrante has cited as a source of inspiration), is likewise getting a fresh look, with a new translation this year of her coming-of-age classic, “Arturo’s Island.”
And yet, Italian women writers still face obstacles.
“The problem is not getting published or selling copies,” Janeczek said. “It’s getting recognition.”
She said that women have generally been kept far from the Italian canon, and that Ferrante’s success overseas is not likely to get her much closer. “When she had all that recognition abroad, our critics said ‘Look, those Americans think she’s a great writer,’” Janeczek said.
In 2015, as Ferrante was receiving enormous acclaim, the novelist Francesco Longo wrote in the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero that “Ferrante is a powerful storyteller. But not a writer.”
Some of Italy’s female critics think their male counterparts are missing the point.
Tiziana de Rogatis, a critic whose book on Ferrante’s diction came out in the United States this month, said that Ferrante, like Morante, is a sophisticated thinker and writer who chooses to write plainly and empathetically to be understood. Academia, she said, eventually catches up with great authors “first popular with the public.”
Some writers and literature professors argue that dusty elitism, more than overt sexism, hinders women from being recognized.
“There is a widespread idea here that literary fiction should be virtuoso and self-referential,” said Elisa Gambaro, a scholar at the University of Milan. As a result, fiction that is commercially successful is often disparaged.
But some women say it should be the other way around.
“To put it bluntly, women writers tend to be less self-referential, because they’re less used to thinking of themselves as the center of the world,” said Brogi, the contemporary literature scholar at the University for Foreigners of Siena. She said women developed literary language to make themselves better understood — and incidentally, easier to translate — because they were so often ignored. It was a condition, she said, that Ferrante had eloquently coined as “smarginatura,” or, roughly put, being pushed to the margins.
But this new crop of women writers is pushing toward the center.
“We are standing up for each other, and calling out the double standards,” Durastanti said. “This sense of sisterhood wasn’t there a few years ago.”
Terranova said the results were already there to see.
“Italy always had great women writers,” she said. “The truly new thing is that, for the first time, they’re getting recognition.”
Correction: Dec. 9, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the setting of the book “La Straniera.” It is between Brooklyn and Basilicata, not Brooklyn and Abruzzo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michelle Wolf Doesn’t Want to Be Your Folk Hero</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It seems like every comic has a routine that deals with outrage culture. But when Michelle Wolf addresses it, you can be sure she is speaking from experience.
She opens her new Netflix stand-up special, “Joke Show,” with an observation. “Over the past couple of years,” she says, “we’ve developed this amazing ability to get mad at anyone for any reason.”
This is Wolf’s way of setting up a joke that leads her into the unpredictable minefield of comments on her Instagram feed. But as she said in a recent interview, her lesson about a culture that has become quick to anger is also a sly acknowledgment of all the tumult that’s recently transpired in her comedy career.
It was April 2018 when Wolf, an audacious if not yet widely known performer from “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” delivered a now-famous routine at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
Treating the event like a comedy roast, as past performers have, Wolf said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary at the time, “burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,” and said of CNN, “You guys love breaking news, and you did it, you broke it.”
Some viewers found it a hilarious exercise in speaking truth to power, but there was also swift and vocal condemnation of the routine from other constituencies. Wolf was disparaged by journalists, former White House officials and President Trump himself, who wrote in a tweet that she was “filthy” and that she had “totally bombed.” And the White House Correspondents’ Association said in a statement, “Unfortunately, the entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of that evening.”
The next month, Netflix introduced Wolf’s weekly topical comedy series, “The Break” — only to cancel the show that summer, providing more ammunition to the comedian’s detractors.
A year and a half later, Wolf is hardly chastened by these events. “Joke Show,” which Netflix will release Dec. 10, is not a direct response to her recent brush with notoriety but it is brimming with the same fierce candor that inspired it.
In this hourlong set, which only briefly addresses the correspondents’ dinner, Wolf dives headlong into topics that she expects will inflame some viewers, including her story about having an abortion.
With her newfound visibility, Wolf wants to show people who she really is as a stand-up: not a political comedian, but one who doesn’t mind being provocative to prove that she can find the humor in almost any subject.
“I say this all the time: Don’t bring your baggage into my joke,” Wolf told me. “A comic’s job isn’t to be right or wrong. They’re just supposed to be funny.”
On an afternoon in early November, Wolf, 34, was in Manhattan’s West Village, enjoying a breather from a barrage of stand-up dates that have lately taken her from Rochester, N.Y., to Sacramento, Calif.
She has only been working as a comedian for about a decade after leaving a career in finance. As in her act, the authentic Wolf has a wryness to her, but she also allows herself to take genuine pleasure in things. She said she enjoyed traveling widely and challenging the preconceptions of her audiences, whatever their political persuasions.
“It’s been making comedy really fun to do that,” she said with no evident sarcasm. “People have such strong beliefs, and you’re like, ‘All right, but — .’ That tension is perfect for comedy.”
If her scorched-earth approach to the correspondents’ dinner irritated so many of its attendees, Wolf wondered why she had been asked to address them in the first place.
“What did they think I was going to do?” she said. “I genuinely think they were like, ‘We’ll hire a woman, there’s no way this can go terribly — she’ll be soft.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, you hired the wrong woman.’”
Looking back on that set, Wolf said she had only one regret — “I would maybe go harder” — and felt that the firestorm of reaction had given her a new boldness. “It’s made me a lot less scared of opinions,” she said. “A lot of people hate me, and I’m alive. It’s fine.”
But she also said the controversy took some of her focus off “The Break,” a mix of stand-up and sketches, and that the show had suffered as a result. “It wasn’t the right time,” she said. “I don’t think I had a clear enough idea of what I really wanted to do.”
“The Break” is one of several attempts at topical comedy programming that Netflix has struggled with in its brief history. (A rare exception has been “Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj,” which has a more global perspective.)
Wolf said she sensed early on in the 10-episode run of her show that Netflix wouldn’t extend its order. “After the first two,” she said, “I was pretty sure they weren’t going to give us more, because we didn’t get any sort of pop.”
Still, the abrupt cancellation of “The Break” generated headlines — some of them arriving before Wolf could share the announcement with staff members — and seemed to leave the impression that Netflix was siding with critics of her correspondents’ dinner performance.
“It really gave people a lot of ammunition to be like, ‘Look at you, you’ll never work again,’” Wolf said. Even so, she said the end of the series was hardly a death sentence for her career. “A lot of great people have had shows canceled,” she said. “But also, so what? Now I just go back to doing stand-up? My favorite thing in the world? Too bad.”
Netflix declined to respond to Wolf’s comments on “The Break,” but Robbie Praw, the streaming service’s director of original stand-up comedy programming, said that he and his colleagues were committed to “making sure that our stand-up slate has the world’s most important voices and the world’s funniest people.” Wolf, he said, is “both of those things.”
He continued, “It’s not enough for her to be the funniest person in the room. It’s also important to her that every premise within that set is unbelievably unique. And then when it comes to putting a special together, you can be sure that every inch of material that she uses, she’s workshopped over 100 times. Every word, every inflection.”
Jared Freid, a friend and fellow comic who often opens for Wolf, said he had seen her become more energized and focused since she resumed touring.
Invoking Wolf’s passions for track and field and distance running, Freid said, “Michelle’s an athlete. I feel like that became motivating for her.”
Sam Morril, a stand-up comic who has known Wolf since the start of her career, said that Netflix had mistreated her in its handling of “The Break” and the show’s cancellation.
“She didn’t want to make a political show, and after the correspondents’ dinner, they completely kneecapped her with that,” said Morril, who did not work on the show.
Wolf, he said, has never been interested in being reaffirmed by any group that already shares her viewpoints and would much rather venture into unknown territory to win over skeptics.
“She’s become a folk hero to Burlington, Vt., and Portland, Ore., but she doesn’t want to be told that you’re my hero,” Morril said. “She wants to hear, ‘You’re so funny.’”
Wolf said she also wanted to feel that she could talk onstage about any of her opinions or experiences, no matter how potentially polarizing. That includes her abortion. In “Joke Show,” she says she believes women “should be able to get an abortion for any reason you want” and recounts how simple and uneventful the experience was for her.
As she says in the bit, “I left work. I got an abortion. I drank half a LaCroix and then I went back to work. Not a big deal and I also think a pretty good advertisement for LaCroix.”
Wolf told me that “as someone who is very, very much pro-choice,” she would have been a hypocrite if she hadn’t addressed this in her act.
“If I didn’t feel comfortable talking about it, and talking about it in such a casual way,” she said, “then I have no right to yell at people for disagreeing with me.”
She added that by sharing her own story, she hoped to make it easier for other women to do the same. “Women try to be very stoic and strong about it,” she said, “when we should talk about it and be very open, because it’s such a big part of life.”
Freid, who toured with Wolf as she worked on the set for “Joke Show,” said her abortion material was not recklessly provocative. “Whether you agree or disagree with anything she says, that bit was created with care while checking, in every part of the country, that it’ll get laughs,” he said.
And then, just at that moment in “Joke Show” when viewers might feel certain they have a handle on Wolf’s perspectives, she veers off into a routine in which she states that men are inherently stronger and faster than women, and how she expects to catch flak for saying this.
Wolf told me, “I think trying to make it seem like women are the same as men takes away from women. Stop trying to compare the two.” After a short pause, she chuckled and added, “Also, it’s just fun to make people a little mad.”
She can cite statistics that she says prove her point about the athletic superiority of men. Whether you accept her premise, it would seem a strange symptom of modern life that a comedian’s act must now be as thoroughly sourced and footnoted as a Wikipedia page.
Wolf said she actually enjoyed fact-checking her routine, awaiting the inevitable pushback from her audience and “arguing it like a legal case.”
“It’s fun to do, but I also make sure I have the logic and the facts to back me up,” she said. “Where you’re like, ‘You’re wrong about that’ and I’m like, ‘I’m actually very right.’ You might feel a certain way but I’m still correct.”
Not every routine has to be a political treatise or a term paper — it can also be an expression of pure silliness, and Wolf said she would like to get back to more of this type of comedy. “There’s plenty of jokes that are absurd and crazy and aren’t in the real world, and those are also really fun too,” she said.
“Hopefully I’ll get more and more confident and not feel like I need to back up all my jokes like that,” she said. “Just sometimes say something ridiculous and be like, well, if I’m wrong, I’m wrong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jeff Bezos says employee activists are wrong and Silicon Valley firms should feel comfortable doing business with the US military</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos threw his weight behind the US Department of Defense on Friday, saying that unless big tech companies collaborated with the US military, "this country is in trouble."
Bezos was being interviewed at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in California, and he discussed employee movements within big tech companies to block contracts with the US military.
"One of the things that's happening inside technology companies is there are groups of employees who for example think that technology companies should not work with the Department of Defense," Bezos said.
The most notable example of this was Google's military drone contract Project Maven, which the company abandoned after intense employee backlash.
"I think it's a really important issue, and people are entitled to their opinions, but it is the job of a senior leadership team to say no," Bezos said.
"It's the senior leadership's team to say to people: 'Look, I understand these are emotional issues, that's OK and we don't have to agree on everything, but this is how we're going to do it. We are going to support the Department of Defense.' This country is important," he added.
Amazon has also had its fair share of employee outrage for its work with government agencies. Amazon employees have petitioned the company's leadership to end its relationship with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So far these efforts have been unsuccessful.
Bezos framed big tech's involvement with the military as a national security issue. "My view is if big tech is going to turn their backs on the Department of Defense, this country is in trouble. That just can't happen," Bezos said.
"We are the good guys," he added. "I really believe that. And I know it's complicated, but do you want a strong national defense or don't you? I think you do."
Amazon is protesting a decision by the Pentagon to award a $10 billion cloud contract, known as JEDI, to Microsoft. Amazon had been expected to get the contract, and court documents unsealed last week show Amazon is alleging bias against it on the part of President Donald Trump.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England will play a friendly against Italy at Wembley in March as part of their preparations for Euro 2020.
Italy are ranked 13th in the world, nine places below England, and finished qualification for the European Championships with a 100% record.
The meeting on Friday 27 March will be the first of four friendlies for Gareth Southgate's side ahead of the Euros.
England also play Denmark at Wembley on 31 March, Austria in Vienna on 2 June and Romania at home on 7 June.
The Italy fixture will also be designated as 'The Heads Up International' in support of the Football Association's partnership with The Duke of Cambridge's Heads Together mental health initiative.
It will be the 28th meeting between England and four-time World Cup winners Italy, with the most recent a 1-1 draw at Wembley in 2018.
The Azzurri are managed by former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England will host Italy in an international friendly at Wembley on March 27 as part of their preparations for Euro 2020.
The fixture, which has been named The Heads Up International in support of The Duke of Cambridge's Heads Together mental health initiative, will be the first of four warm-up matches for the Three Lions ahead of the tournament.
England also face Denmark at Wembley on March 31 before travelling to face Austria in Vienna on June 2.
Gareth Southgate's side will then take on Romania in their final warm-up match on June 7, at a home venue outside of London.
The last meeting between England and Italy ended in a 1-1 draw at Wembley in 2018, while the last competitive match between the two sides was a 2-1 win for the Azzurri at the 2014 World Cup.
Both sides are among the favourites to win Euro 2020.
England will face Croatia and Czech Republic in Group D alongside the winner of play-off C, while Italy will play Turkey, Switzerland and Wales in Group A.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City 'planning on life without Pep Guardiola' amid uncertainty over his future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City have already begun making arrangements in preparation for Pep Guardiola's departure.
The City boss has been in the hotseat at the Etihad since 2016, and is said to be open to extending his deal with the club beyond its current 2021 expiration.
However it is felt Guardiola could call time on his spell at City at the end of this season, particularly if they manage to win the Champions League.
Guardiola has never spent more than four seasons as manager of one club, with him now into his fourth campaign at City.
And the Athletic report that this is something the City hierarchy are now planning for, after sounding out potential candidates for a backroom role.
City are believed to be looking to fill a position which would see the successful candidate work closely with the medical and fitness departments aligned with the first team.
The role would initially be limited, but would become very hands-on if Guardiola were to depart.
In discussions with potential candidates, it is said to have been made clear that this could be Guardiola's last season in charge.
Contingency plans to replace managers are not uncommon, but an appointment of this nature would likely cause some friction with Guardiola and his backroom team.
For this reason City are keen for the role to be more of an opportunity for the candidate to become familiar with the processes currently in place at the club, rather than to impact the team in any way.
Guardiola's position at City has becoming an increased topic of debate following City's poor start to the season.
Defeat to rivals Man Utd at the weekend leaves them 14 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool , and City's squad is starting to show the first signs of needing to rebuild and replace aging stars such as Fernandinho and David Silva - which Guardiola may not wish to oversee.
When quizzed on his future at the end of last month, Guardiola said: "I'm so comfortable working with this club.
"When you are [somewhere for] five years it depends on the results. We will see what happens this season and next season."
Speaking about the prospect of staying on, he added: "I'm open [to it], yes. It is not about what the club wants or not. For me, I want to see my players and the reaction of my players and everything.
"It is not as simple as I want to extend. I want to see the club, I want to see the players, I want to see how we are still working together.
"That is the most important thing after five years together. You have to feel like we can do it together and enjoy to work together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brit arrested after 'two-mile wrecking spree' with 'stolen coach' in Benidorm</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A British man has been arrested after he allegedly went on a near two-mile wrecking spree with a stolen coach in Benidorm.
CCTV footage shows the coach smashing into mopeds and cars parked by the side of the road.
A police car was also damaged during the drama, which happened around 3.30am on Sunday morning.
The coach was driven at speed through the Spanish holiday resort after being taken from a depot where it had been left for the night.
The suspect is alleged to have accessed a room where the key was kept.
Do you know the British suspect? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.
Police sources confirmed the suspect is a British national.
One local said: “It was lucky there were few people around at that time of the night otherwise things could have turned out a lot worse.
“A lot of cars and motorbikes have been damaged but no-one fortunately has been hurt that I know of.”
The coach was taken from a car park near a sports centre known locally as the Palau d’Esports l’Illa on the outskirts of Benidorm.
It was driven towards the town centre and into a neighbourhood known as Els Tolls, even passing by the local police HQ at one point before being stopped in a road.
The exact number of vehicles damaged has yet to be disclosed.
The suspect has been handed over to the National Police force and is expected to appear in court later on Monday or Tuesday on suspicion of stealing a vehicle and road traffic offences.
He would have been breathalysed and made to take a drugs test, but the results of the tests have not been made public yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moment 'drunken' British tourist steals a coach in Benidorm and goes on a wild two-mile, high-speed wrecking spree</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A British tourist allegedly stole a coach in Benidorm before going on a two-mile, high-speed wrecking spree and smashing into cars and motorbikes.  
The vehicle was taken from a depot on the outskirts of the Spanish town where it had been left for the night before being driven at speed through the holiday resort.
The unnamed 27-year-old, believed to be a drunken tourist although officials have yet to comment, is said to have got into a room where the key was kept before making off with one of the vehicles.
Footage of his wild drive showed him smashing into mopeds and cars parked by the side of the road.
A police car was also damaged during the drama, which happened around 3.30am on Sunday morning.
Overnight reports citing local council sources pointed to the detainee possibly being a foreign tourist.
Police sources confirmed this morning he was a British national, although they offered no information on his age and what might have prompted his wrecking spree.
One local said: 'It was lucky there were few people around at that time of the night otherwise things could have turned out a lot worse.
'A lot of cars and motorbikes have been damaged but no-one fortunately has been hurt that I know of.'
The coach was taken from a car park near a sports centre known locally as the Palau d'Esports l'Illa on the outskirts of Benidorm.
It was driven towards the town centre and into a neighbourhood known as Els Tolls, even passing by the local police HQ at one point before being stopped in a road called Belgium Avenue which is Avenida de Belgica in Spanish.
Separate footage showed the coach on the kerb after it was brought to a stop surrounded by several police cars.
The witness who took the video said: 'There it is. I don't know if someone stole it. It was driven up three or four streets the wrong way.
'It was absolute madness. He's destroyed everything, a load of cars and this is where he has parked it. The side of the coach is really damaged.'
Another witness called Chris Garrido said: 'I saw it enter my street last night from my flat. I saw everything, how it smashed up mopeds in front of the police station and smashed a wing mirror and the back of a police van.
'It crashed into three cars at the start of the street and several mopeds and cars as well as metal bollards, and that was just in Grecia Street.
'I don't know if it was the normal driver of the vehicle and he was p***ed up or someone who was also p***ed up and had stolen it.'
Local Francisco Medina added on social media: 'Benidorm doesn't change.
'Us Spanish are being hit with taxes everywhere and the English do what they like and nothing happens.'  
The exact number of vehicles damaged has yet to be disclosed.
The suspect has been handed over to the National Police force and is expected to appear in court later today or tomorrow on suspicion of stealing a vehicle and road traffic offences.
He would have been breathalysed and made to take a drugs test, but the results of the tests have not been made public yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tourist tweets escape from New Zealand's White Island volcano</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Tourist Michael Schade stood at the crater of New Zealand’s White Island volcano minutes before it erupted on Monday and shared his terrifying experience in a series of messages and videos posted on social media.
“My God, White Island volcano in New Zealand erupted today for first time since 2001. My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it,” he tweeted.
“Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable.”
Several people were killed and injured and others were reported missing when the volcano erupted apparently without warning off the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island.
In video Schade posted on Twitter as he sped away from the island in a boat, a huge plume of white ash soars into the sky as a group of frightened tourists huddle close to the shore.
A helicopter parked nearby on the island looks crumpled and covered in ash.
“Those are some of the people (our) boat picked up. Praying for them and their recovery. Woman my mom tended to was in critical condition but seemed strong by the end,” Schade tweeted to his 2,570 followers.
“The helicopters on the island looked destroyed.”
Schade describes himself in his Twitter handle as someone who likes “helping people, photography, reading, gym, traveling, and learning new things”. He says he lives in San Francisco.
“This is so hard to believe. Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before,” he tweeted.
“My thoughts (are) with the families of those currently unaccounted for, the people recovering now, and especially the rescue workers.”
He also praised tour operators who helped tend to people in the minutes after the eruption.
“Endless gratitude to that crew for stepping up as first responders,” he wrote.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China says people held in Xinjiang camps have 'graduated', condemns U.S. bill</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING (Reuters) - People held in camps in China’s Xinjiang region have now “graduated” and new trainees will have the freedom to come and go, the regional governor said on Monday.
Governor Shohrat Zakir also hit out at Western criticism of the camps and said the United States had launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It describes the detainees as students.
“At present the trainees who have participated...have all graduated,” Zakir told a news conference in Beijing. “With the help of the government, stable employment has been achieved and their quality of life has been improved.”
Xinjiang will continue with training based on “independent will” and “the freedom to come and go”, he said.
China has not provided any official figures on how many people have been held in the camps but Zakhir said foreign estimates were “pure fabrication”. He gave no details.
He also called a measure passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that condemned China’s treatment of the Uighur minority a severe violation of international law and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs.
“The U.S. is getting restless and has launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang,” Zakir said. “But no force can stop Xinjiang’s progress toward stability and development.”
Claims about the camps are hard to verify as China only allows periodic supervised visits and gives little information on their operations.
In July, a Xinjiang official said most people had returned to society from the camps. Asked on Monday how many people had completed the training, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she could not give an exact number.
“Because the number of people participating in these training centers is dynamic, there’s coming and going, so it’s very difficult to give an exact number,” Hua told reporters at a separate briefing.
Human rights groups and former detainees have said conditions in the camps are poor, with inmates subject to psychological and physical abuse.
At Zakir’s news conference, images of past violence were displayed in excerpts from an English-language documentary, “Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang” aired on state broadcaster CGTN last week.
Hua expressed disappointment at the lack of foreign media coverage of the documentary despite the intense concern over the Xinjiang issue.
She said there had been no terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years due to the success of the camps.
The U.S. Uighur Act passed by the House of Representatives last week requires the U.S. president to condemn abuses against Muslims and calls for the closure of the camps in Xinjiang.
It also calls on President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on a member of China’s powerful politburo, Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo.
The issue, along with Washington’s support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, complicates prospects for a near-term deal to end a 17-month long trade war between China and the United States.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, the TASS news agency reported.
WADA’s executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Japan PM Abe discussing Japan visit by Iranian President Rouhani</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that Tokyo is in discussions about a visit to Japan by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this month, an attempt to try to resolve Iran’s nuclear impasse with the United States.
He also said Japan wants to make every possible effort to promote Middle East peace.
Japan maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran, and has tried to ease tension between the countries, which broke off diplomatic relations after Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution.
Citing a senior diplomatic source, Kyodo news agency reported last week that Iran had proposed the visit and that the proposal was relayed during a two-day visit to Japan by Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs Abbas Araqchi.
Abe said Japan would make every effort to promote peace in the Middle East but did not specify when there might be a decision on sending Japanese seamen to the region to guard ships supplying Japan.
“As one of those efforts, we are currently in talks about a visit by President Rouhani to Japan,” he added.
Abe did not give details but local media reported the visit could take place on Dec. 20 or 21.
The Nikkei business daily said last week the government would propose deploying one escort ship and a patrol aircraft from the Maritime Self-Defense Force on a one-year mission that could be renewed annually. It plans to finalize the plan by year-end, the Nikkei said.
Abe visited Iran in July and met with Rouhani and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during which Khamenei reiterated Iran’s stance that it has no intention of making or using nuclear weapons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian forces enter former Islamic State stronghold in Syria after U.S. pullback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian forces have entered Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the Islamic State caliphate, in one of the starkest examples yet of how Moscow has filled the vacuum created by President Donald Trump’s decision to pull U.S. forces from northern Syria.
Russian troops were shown in footage on the defense ministry’s Zvezda TV channel shaking hands with Syrian children and unloading humanitarian aid bundles with the slogan “Russia is with you” from the back of trucks.
Raqqa was captured two years ago by U.S. troops and their Kurdish-led Syrian allies in the biggest victory of Washington’s campaign against Islamic State in Syria. But since Trump abruptly ordered a pull-out in October, Moscow has swiftly advanced into territory where U.S. troops had operated.
Russia is a close battlefield ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, which was invited by the Kurds into territory they controlled after Trump pulled his forces out of the way of a Turkish assault against Kurdish-held areas.
Russian troops in Raqqa were handing out humanitarian aid and its military doctors were offering residents medical attention, Vladimir Varnavsky, a defense ministry officer, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.
“Work in the city to get rid of the rubble and clear the area (of bombs or mines) is not yet complete and there is a shortage of clean water, medicine and food,” he said.
Russia last month set up a helicopter base an airport in a northeastern Syrian city and also landed forces at a sprawling air base in the region that had been vacated by U.S. forces.
Russia and Turkey are carrying out joint patrols along Syria’s northern border with Turkey as part of a deal struck between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan.
After saying all U.S. troops would leave northern Syria, Washington has left some behind for now at some bases but rolled back most of their operations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey says it has deported 11 French terrorist suspects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday it had deported 11 French nationals back to France as part of a program to extradite what it says are foreign terrorist fighters.
Turkey’s Interior Ministry, which made the announcement, gave no details. France’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment, but diplomatic sources said the 11 included four women and seven children.
Turkey is holding hundreds of Islamic State suspects and last month launched a program to repatriate detainees that has caused friction with its NATO allies.
Ankara has accused European countries of being too slow to take back citizens who traveled to the Middle East to fight.
Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said in November that Ankara would repatriate most detainees with suspected links to Islamic State by the end of this year.
The move is forcing European governments to decide how to handle the return of radicalized militants, including those with battlefield experience.
Paris signed an agreement with Ankara five years ago for French nationals arrested by Turkish authorities to be deported in coordination with the French authorities. Turkey has expelled almost 300 French nationals since then, French officials say.
France’s Center for Analysis of Terrorism said one of the newly deported women was Amandine Le Coz, who had been married to a Moroccan militant killed in Syria. She joined Islamic State with her husband in 2014.
It said another was Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old French national who lived in Britain before joining Islamic State in 2015 and who recruited several teenage women. Gondal is banned from re-entering Britain.
France’s foreign ministry and interior ministry declined to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Swelling U.S. IPO backlog points to crowded 2020 field</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - More and more companies are putting plans for U.S. initial public offerings (IPO) on ice this year because of investor pushback against their valuations, creating a backlog that could make stock market debuts more challenging in 2020.
While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs, investor sentiment quickly soured. Shares of high-profile startups such as Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) languished in the months following their listings, culminating in office-sharing startup WeWork cancelling its IPO in September.
This has led to companies’ postponing listing plans. Some 44 companies withdrew their IPO registration in 2019 as of Dec. 3, up almost 50% on 2018 and the highest level since 2016, according to IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.
Proceeds from new U.S. listings in 2019 through to November are down 7% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv data. Last month was the third-slowest November for U.S. IPOs in the last 10 years.
Online mattress retailer Casper, clothing company Madewell, cybersecurity firm McAfee and Reynolds Consumer Products are among a growing number of companies putting plans for a U.S. stock market debut on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.
Casper, McAfee, Reynolds and J. Crew Group Inc, which owns Madewell, declined to comment.
Companies eyeing a 2020 listing will have to grapple not just with a busy runway but with potential market volatility fueled by the heated political rhetoric of the U.S. presidential election.
“Everybody is assuming a lot of unpredictability because of the elections next year, so there is likely to be a much bigger chilling effect than anything that has happened with companies until this point with valuations or performance,” said Kenneth Guernsey, a capital markets partner at law firm Cooley LLP.
A stock market rally that has pushed corporate valuations to historic highs should have supported many of these IPOs this year. However, the shares of many newly listed companies, which in many cases have yet to turn a profit, traded poorly, causing investors to fret that they overpaid in their IPOs.
“It’s very hard for normal investors to determine the actual value of these companies, because most of them don’t go public with profits,” said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.
To be sure, some companies have indicated a willingness to press on with IPO plans, despite the challenging conditions, with the likes of payments platform Bill.com Holdings and XP Inc, Brazil’s largest digital broker, slated to complete public listings in New York next week.
But in the absence of easy access to public markets, some companies are debating whether to go back to private market investors for fresh funding, given that many venture capital and private equity investors are searching for deals.
“The private market is currently flushed with trillions of dollars of dry powder to continue funding private companies,” said Rashaun Williams, general partner of the All-Star Fund at Manhattan Venture Partners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tighter climate policies could erase $2.3 trillion in companies value: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Tighter government climate regulations by 2025 could wipe up to $2.3 trillion off the value of companies in industries ranging from fossil fuel producers to agriculture and car makers, an investor group warned in a report.
Rules aimed at lowering carbon emissions are expected to accelerate in the coming years as countries scramble to meet obligations under the 2015 Paris climate agreement limiting global warming.
Any abrupt policy shifts risk severely disrupting current investment strategies, U.N.-backed Principles of Responsible Investing (PRI), a group representing investors with $86 trillion of assets under management, said in a report.
“As the realities of climate change catch up, social pressure mounts, and low carbon solutions get cheaper, it’s highly improbable that governments will be allowed to let the world sleep-walk into greater rises in temperature without being compelled into forceful action sooner,” PRI Chief Executive Fiona Reynolds said.
“This poses huge threats for assets and for the wider system.”
Most exposed is the fossil fuel sector which could lose one third of its current value, the report said. Fossil fuels account for around two thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Coal firms could lose as much as 44% in value, while the world’s top oil and gas companies risk losing up to 31% of their current market share, according the report which forecasts oil demand peaking around 2027.
The analysis showed that broad index-based funds such as the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI.O) could lose up to 4.5% or $2.3 trillion in its value under the most extreme scenario.
The shift would nevertheless also lead to winners.
Auto makers heavily invested in electric vehicles and electric utility firms using low-carbon power could more than double their values, the report said.
The report came out as world leaders meet in Madrid for the 2019 United Nations climate change conference, known as COP25.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This was supposed to be the climate crisis election. So what happened?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The public want action, but with the Tories obsessed with Brexit, the issue hasn’t gained traction in the media
The moment I began to lose hope that this really would be “the climate election” came the day after Channel 4 hosted its climate debate. For the first time in British history, party leaders had gathered to discuss how to tackle the climate crisis. Yet the papers and morning TV and radio shows didn’t seem particularly interested in the discussion: they spent more time talking about Michael Gove and Stanley Johnson’s Borat-esque attempt to storm the doors with a camera crew.
It’s useless to waste energy blaming Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, for this. There is a term used in basketball to explain the behaviour of an incorrigible gunner who hoists a shot at every opportunity: shooters shoot. It’s just their nature. Gove goves, meaning if you trot him out, he does personally and professionally debasing things in front of television cameras to lock down their attention.
Besides, this isn’t just about the media’s weakness for the stuntmen of British politics – Boris Johnson, Gove and Nigel Farage chief among them. It’s part of a larger failure to seriously report on or analyse climate policy during this election campaign. It is, admittedly, difficult to cover the climate crisis: no journalist or organisation has yet nailed the perfect balance of scientific perspective and personal connection, of apocalyptic warning and hope.
But the situation in this election seems particularly straightforward. There is a public galvanised by a year of popular protest, who consistently say that they care deeply about the climate crisis and want it addressed – that it will influence their vote. There are also multiple political parties that have committed to bold, transformative climate policies, but with markedly different approaches. If only there were some institution in public life to bridge that gap, to mediate that conversation.
So far, it hasn’t happened. There has been a steady drip-feed of straight reporting of the parties’ policies, and the Channel 4 climate debate was a big step forward. But across the media landscape there is remarkable resistance to having a serious discussion about climate politics and how far they’ve come. The incredible scale of the proposals makes this especially baffling. Just on the plain numbers, Labour has committed to £250bn in public spending to fight the climate crisis, the Liberal Democrats to £100bn, and the Greens £1tn. To give a sense of scale, the Iraq war cost the UK £9.6bn, the war in Afghanistan £20.6bn and bank bailouts between 2008 and 2011 cost the UK taxpayer £124bn. I believe all of those things were widely talked about.
In the policies themselves, there are commitments to epochal, systemic changes that would transform the landscape of this country and the daily lives of its inhabitants. Labour’s green new deal would shift nearly a million workers into new industries and slate nearly every home in the UK for refurbishment. The Lib Dems have broached the possibility of a flight tax to reduce aviation emissions, something no other country has yet instituted. Yet despite the novelty and scale of the proposals, the British media has shown frustratingly little curiosity in analysing or unpacking them. This isn’t really so surprising. The media has come in for plenty of criticism in this election cycle, and much of that criticism applies equally to its climate reporting. There is a deep conservatism in the British press that tends towards dismissing or resisting potential changes to the current order – and in most cases, avoids discussing them at all. It is as if it lacks the theory or the language to do so.
There are established narratives about the issues, about politicians and about the electorate that can’t be dislodged. The recent tectonic shift in public opinion and political will on climate over the past year can join the polarisation of the electorate, the “Faragisation” of the Conservative party, and even the longrunning and obvious push to privatise the NHS, as issues the media seems incapable of grappling with.
And then there is the fact that climate reporting has always proceeded on a separate track, in a silo apart from mainstream concerns. Facts are reported, but in discussion and analysis, there is a pervasive sense that things aren’t about to change – despite all evidence to the contrary. We are told by scientists, activists, and now by the majority of our politicians that we face perhaps the greatest crisis in human history, and that immense upheaval is coming. For all the impact this has made on the coverage of this campaign, you’d think it was happening on another planet.
When this contest was called journalists initially asked if it would be the “climate election”. They then failed to live up to their own promise. The climate crisis is already part of the election – it’s time the media treated it that way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crossword blog: the New Yorker's cryptic puzzles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year, we were delighted to see that the New Yorker had begun a crossword series, which has since gone twice-weekly. I feigned annoyance that the puzzles weren’t cryptic; they are, in fact a challenging and literate take on the American puzzle style, which often misleads in a way that’s not a million miles from our own crosswords.
The New Yorker did have a cryptic – in the 1990s. Last month, the magazine created the post of puzzles-and-games editor. Liz Maynes-Aminzade is the inaugural honcho and, she tells me, was persuaded by her colleague Nick Henriquez to try solving some of the cryptics in the archive. “I had to really sweat through the first five or so,” she says, “but then something clicked. Now, of course, I love them.”
A batch of the old puzzles has reappeared as a kind of Thanksgiving gift, with more to follow weekly. They’re very moreish, partly because they use 10-by-8 grids (in “portrait” orientation); I presumed that this was solely to give newcomers a gentler solving experience, but there’s more to it. Says Maynes-Aminzade:
Of course the visuals were part of the decision. And in terms of construction, the clues are closer to the Guardian’s quiptic (“for beginners and those in a hurry”) than, say, an Enigmatist workout. I wondered what would be the American equivalents of all those British abbreviations from cricket and the armed forces that make UK cryptics that little bit tricker for non-native solvers. Letters denoting things from private healthcare, sports leagues and the way they name their radio stations, perhaps?
But the hurdle isn’t there. “When our puzzles use abbreviations and initialisms,” says Maynes-Aminzade, “they tend to be common ones: periodic table elements, cardinal directions, etc. In other words, our puzzle is easier than yours!”
“Maybe the closest analog,” she adds, “would be names of American actors – I’ve seen multiple puzzles that play on SLY for Sylvester Stallone, for instance. But I imagine even these references to the Italian Stallion will be legible to British solvers.”
They are, and it’s worth noting here that it’s a shame that I come across the fine Irish actor Stephen RAE more often in American puzzles than I do in the film pages of British papers. And in the New Yorker’s cryptics, there are more British bits and pieces – ETON collars, say – than I had expected to find. Does the American cryptic community overlap with the anglophone gang?
Yes, we know the type. Some of them probably even read the Guardian. Two of the paper’s setters, Anna Shechtman and Erik Agard, have made a video guide to cryptic wordplay. Depending how the old puzzles go down, we may be seeing some new cryptics from the likes of that pair. I hope we do.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two Wolves supporters arrested for homophobic abuse at Brighton game</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">• Brighton confirm arrests during 2-2 draw on Sunday• ‘We simply won’t stand for it at the Amex’
Brighton have announced that two visiting supporters were arrested on suspicion of homophobic abuse during Sunday’s match with Wolves at the Amex Stadium.
Two men, aged 46 and 48 from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, were ejected from the away section during the 2-2 draw and later arrested by Sussex Police outside the ground. They have since been released pending investigation.
The incident was one of several cases of alleged homophobic abuse at top-flight matches during a week in which the Premier League has backed Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport.
Brighton’s chief executive and deputy chairman, Paul Barber, told the club’s official website: “It’s both sad and depressing that once again we find ourselves having to address another situation of discriminatory abuse. Prior to kick-off, we had a huge show of support for the Rainbow Laces campaign brilliantly backed by the vast majority of people inside the stadium, and yet before the game is over, we are forced to deal with these two individuals, who think it’s OK to behave in this way.
“Working with Sussex Police, I’m pleased to report that once again our staff were able to take swift action, which hopefully will increase the chances of a conviction. We simply won’t stand for it at the Amex. Once again, it’s very hard to comprehend why some individuals think it’s acceptable to behave in this way, but we are very clear that neither Brighton and Hove Albion, nor the wider football community, will tolerate homophobia or discrimination at any time, in any form. We would urge any fans confronted with similar discriminatory behaviour to report it immediately, either directly to a steward or via our anonymous hotline, and we will take strong action.”
Wolves have confirmed they will be supporting Sussex Police’s investigation into the incident and say they strongly condemn any form of discrimination.
A club statement said: “Wolves can confirm that there were two arrests for homophobic abuse at yesterday’s game against Brighton and Hove Albion. There is no room in football or society for discrimination of any kind, and the club strongly condemns such behaviour.
“Our ethos at Wolves is about being ‘One Pack’ – an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch. The club is now offering its support to Sussex Police in what is a criminal investigation.”
A Sussex Police statement said: “Two football fans were arrested following reports of homophobic gestures made at the Amex Stadium on Sunday 8 December. The suspects – both away fans during Brighton and Hove Albion’s match against Wolverhampton Wanderers – were identified by club stewards and arrested on suspicion of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
“The two men – aged 46 and 48, and both from Bridgnorth in Shropshire – have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.”
Monday’s announcements from Brighton and Wolves come after Everton launched an investigation on Sunday into reports of homophobic chanting aimed at Chelsea fans during the Toffees’ 3-1 victory at Goodison Park on Saturday. Also on Sunday, a 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence following Saturday’s Manchester derby between City and United at the Etihad Stadium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NSW fires: state faces 'lethal' conditions as temperatures forecast to soar past 40C</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RFS commissioner says despite lower wind speed on Tuesday, high temperature and low humidity will make it a ‘difficult day’ with the New South Wales bushfires
NSW is facing a potentially “lethal” cocktail of bushfire conditions with smoke pollution set to smother Sydney and temperatures to soar past 40C.
The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says wind speeds won’t be as high as previous dangerous days, but this will be cancelled out by high temperatures and low humidity.
“It’s not as bad as the catastrophic weather we had weeks ago, but it’s certainly going to be another difficult day, particularly given the scale and complexity of these fires and their proximity to so much more built up and populated areas,” he told reporters on Monday.
“We’ve got fires effectively stretching now from the Queensland border right down to our far south coast area.”
Fitzsimmons said his firefighting crews were beginning to feel the pinch amid an unprecedented NSW bushfire season in which six lives and more than 680 homes have been lost.
“They’ve been flogged now for months, particularly up in the north ... and [with] the fire activity extending further south, we’re literally rotating through thousands of people every day, every week,” he said.
Crews are working on a so-called mega-fire north-west of Sydney, which was formed when the huge Gospers Mountain blaze merged with the neighbouring Little L Complex, Paddock Run, Three Mile and Kerry Ridge fires.
The RFS says the mega-fire will continue to burn until it is doused with rain.
“[Tuesday] is a very dangerous day for NSW given the combination of very hot, windy conditions and that has been lethal in the last few months,” the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said.
“We know, given the horror summer we’re likely to have with hot, dry, drought conditions, everybody doing their bit is important.”
The NSW Health environmental health director, Dr Richard Broome, said Tuesday is likely to be “very hot and very smoky”.
“It’s going to be putting a lot of stress on vulnerable people, particularly elderly people who have existing heat and lung conditions.”
The NSW environment department says air quality will be poor in Sydney on Tuesday and could “cause symptoms, especially with people with heart or lung disease”.
Weather bureau state manager Jane Golding says temperatures could be higher than 40C in greater Sydney, the Hunter, the Illawarra and northern parts of the state.
There were almost 90 fires burning across NSW on Monday evening with 39 of those out of control.
The RFS is forecasting a “severe” fire danger for Greater Sydney, Illawarra-Shoalhaven, the Greater Hunter, the ACT and the southern and central ranges on Tuesday.
Total fire bans are in place for each of these regions, as well as the Monaro, the southern slopes, the eastern Riverina, and the north-western parts of the state.
The NSW Police deputy commissioner, Gary Worboys, reminded the public not to leave children or pets unattended in vehicles.
“Not only is it dangerous, it can be deadly,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp insists he has never doubted quality of £52.7m man Naby Keita</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insists he has never doubted the quality of £52.7million midfielder Naby Keita.
Keita, who arrived at Anfield to much fanfare in the summer of 2018, has been reduced to a peripheral figure and played a limited role in last season’s Champions League success and the club’s current 33-game Premier League unbeaten run.
The Guinea international gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday’s 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Reds boss Klopp, who has reassured the 24-year-old about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.
“Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?,” said Klopp.
“We are not flying, it’s not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.
“Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, ‘why don’t I play?’ I get all that.
“So we stayed in contact, we talked and we spoke a lot about it.
“But in the end of course a player needs to have this evidence that the manager still believes in you. I was never in doubt about that.
“It was just unlucky and in life you need luck always. He started (his Liverpool career) really well – everybody forgot that – then got injured. And again we had two really good seasons.
“(I was) never in doubt about his quality.”
Former RB Leipzig player Keita doubled Liverpool’s advantage at the Vitality Stadium and then slipped in Mohamed Salah for the third after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring.
Liverpool last lost a league game back in early January but, despite building a sizeable points advantage over Leicester and Manchester City at the top of the table, Klopp is not getting carried away.
“I don’t know if it’s so special because we don’t think about it,” he said of the unbeaten run.
“We get confronted with our winning streak always after the game, that’s the only moment. From that moment on, nobody thinks about it.
“It’s not that I have to keep myself together because I’m flying and want to constantly smile and run around.
“I’m pretty concerned about always the next game and that means we have to make sure that we’re always in the best possible shape.
“And the boys are in the same mood. The boys so far were 100 per cent serious and will stay (like that) and see where it leads us.”
The comfortable nature of the south coast success meant Klopp was afforded the luxury of giving breathers to unused substitutes Divock Origi – who scored twice in Wednesday’s Merseyside derby win over Everton – and Sadio Mane ahead of Tuesday’s crunch European clash with RB Salzburg.
Klopp also gave midfielders Adam Lallana and Georgino Wijnaldum the weekend off because of minor injury concerns.
He believes resting and rotating his players will be key to successfully negotiating a hectic December schedule and competing in five different competitions.
“It was wonderful – maybe the best thing of the (Bournemouth) game – we didn’t have to use Sadio Mane,” said the German, whose team must avoid defeat in Austria to reach the Champions League knockout stages.
“He was the all-time (ever-present) player in the last couple of weeks, so he could stay outside, Divock outside.
“The people were shouting for Divock Origi, I get that, I loved the performance of Divock Origi (against Everton) but bringing him on to say thank you or whatever, we have so many games.
“We will see how we start on Tuesday. I have no clue about that now.
“But (on Saturday) we could give at least one or two – plus Gini (Wijnaldum), plus Adam – kind of a rest, and hopefully they are all fit again on Tuesday and then we make a new decision.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Klopp never doubted Keita's quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he has never doubted the quality of midfielder Naby Keita despite the Guinea international's limited impact since his arrival at Anfield last year.
Keita has been confined to a bit-part role since his £52.75 million ($69 million) move from RB Leipzig in July 2018 and before Saturday had played just 14 minutes of Premier League football this season.
But the 24-year-old, whose Anfield career has been disrupted by injuries, gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday's 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Klopp, who has reassured Keita about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.
"Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?," said Klopp.
"We are not flying, it's not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.
"Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, 'why don't I play?' I get all that. So we stayed in contact, we talked and we spoke a lot about it."
Klopp said he never questioned the player's quality.
"It was just unlucky and in life you need luck always," he said. "He started (his Liverpool career) really well -- everybody forgot that -- then got injured. And again we had two really good seasons."
Liverpool last lost a league game in early January but despite an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester, Klopp is not getting carried away.
"I don't know if it's so special because we don't think about it," he said of the unbeaten run.
"We get confronted with our winning streak always after the game, that's the only moment. From that moment on, nobody thinks about it."
Klopp believes resting and rotating his players will be key to successfully negotiating a hectic December schedule, during which they are competing in multiple competitions.
"It was wonderful -- maybe the best thing of the (Bournemouth) game -- we didn't have to use Sadio Mane," said the German boss, whose team must avoid defeat against Salzburg on Tuesday to guarantee reaching the Champions League knockout stages."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Keita's ability has never been in question, says Klopp</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has made it clear that he never doubted the talent of industrious midfielder Naby Keita.
Keita, who arrived at Anfield to much fanfare in the summer of 2018, has been reduced to a peripheral figure and played a limited role in last season's Champions League success and the club's current 33-game Premier League unbeaten run.
The Guinea international gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday's 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Reds boss Klopp, who has reassured the 24-year-old about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.
"Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?" said Klopp.

"Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, 'why don't I play?' I get all that.
"So, we stayed in contact, we talked, and we spoke a lot about it.
"But in the end, of course, a player needs to have this evidence that the manager still believes in you. I was never in doubt about that.
"It was just unlucky and in life, you need luck always. He started (his Liverpool career) really well - everybody forgot that - then got injured. And again, we had two really good seasons.
"(I was) never in doubt about his quality."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2019 general election campaign is in full swing, and polling day is drawing closer. The deadline to apply for postal votes and proxy votes has now passed.
So if you are already registered for either a postal or proxy vote in this year's general election, read on to make sure your vote gets counted.
In England, Scotland and Wales, you can choose to vote by post if you cannot or do not wish to attend your polling station in person.  Different arrangements for postal voting apply in Northern Ireland. See here for further details.
No - the deadline in England, Scotland and Wales was 11.59pm on Nov 26. If you did not apply before this deadline, you won't be able to vote by post. 
There’s a different form to apply to vote by post or proxy in Northern Ireland. The deadline to register for a postal vote in Northern Ireland was 21 Nov. You can still apply for a temporary postal or proxy vote on the grounds of unforeseen circumstances related to health - head here for more information.
If you have registered to vote by post, your postal vote must arrive at your Electoral Office in the UK by 10pm on Dec 12, the day of the election. 
If you're unable to post your voting pack in time, you can take it to your local polling station on polling day by 10pm, or to your local Electoral Registration Office before they close.
Complete your ballot paper in secret, then put it in the envelope supplied and seal it tight.  
You must also remember to fill in and sign the accompanying postal voting statement.
Put both items into the larger envelope and post it back to your local electoral registration office. 
Yes. A postal vote can be sent to your home address, or any other address you provide. You just need to remember to allow enough time for it to be returned so it arrives back by 10pm on polling day otherwise your vote won't be counted.
If you're posting your vote from overseas you'll need to pay for postage. Otherwise there's a Freepost envelope provided for returns within the UK.
If you’re unable to vote in person you can ask someone to vote on your behalf. This is called a proxy vote.
You can only apply for a proxy vote under certain circumstances, including:
The deadline to apply for a proxy vote in this year's general election was 5pm on Dec 4. The deadline has now passed.
If you have an emergency that means you cannot vote in person, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote. This must be something you were not aware of before Dec 4. 
You can find more information about emergency proxy votes here.
You can ask anyone to act as your proxy - as long as they:

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to vote in the 2019 general election </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are two weeks left until the 2019 general election polling day. Here is everything you need to know about how to vote on Dec 12.
The general election is on Dec 12 2019. The votes will choose a total of 650 people to become members of Parliament (MPs), who will decide how to proceed with Brexit.
Usually general elections are held every five years, but this will be the third since 2015. 
Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, so long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. 
No - the deadline to register to vote was midnight on Tuesday Nov 26.  Anyone who missed this deadline will not be able to vote in this year's general election.
The deadline to apply to vote by post was also on Nov 26. If you are registered to vote by post, your postal vote must arrive at your Electoral Office in the UK by 10pm on Dec 12, the day of the election.
If you’re already registered to vote but unable to vote in person, there is still time to apply to vote by proxy. This means someone will vote on your behalf. You need to apply by 5pm on Dec 4 to vote by proxy in the general election in England, Scotland or Wales.
You can find more information on postal votes and proxy votes here.
To see who is standing in your part of the country, visit the Who Can I Vote For? website.

Still unsure who to vote for? If you're thinking of voting tactically to get your preferred Brexit outcome, try our tactical voting guide to get our recommendation on whether voting tactically could actually affect your seat. 
You will receive a polling card before the election telling you where to vote. It will be a local polling station, set up in places such as school halls or churches. You can only vote at the polling station location on your card.
When you arrive at the polling station, give your name and address to the staff members inside. They will give you a ballot paper to select your candidate on. Fold the ballot paper in half and put it in the ballot box after making your choice. 
The polling card is for your information only - you do not need to take it to the polling station and you can still vote if you have misplaced it. 
Polling booths will be open between 7am and 10pm on election day - 12 December. Counting of votes will begin when the polls close. 
If medical reasons or your occupation, service or employment means that you cannot go to the polling station, you can apply to vote by emergency proxy up until 5pm on polling day.
If you already know that you will not be able to make it to your polling station on 12 December, you can apply for a postal vote or register for a proxy vote in advance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jose Mourinho targets January swoop for ex-Man Utd star Marouane Fellaini</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly interested in bringing his former player Marouane Fellaini to the club in the January transfer window.
Fellaini is now at Chinese side Shandong Luneng after current Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer let him leave the club earlier this year, but the 32-year-old is thought to be open to a return to the Premier League.
Fellaini played under Mourinho during his time at United, and according to Les Sports Mourinho wants to reunite with the Belgian.
The towering midfielder has impressed during his spell in China, scoring 12 goals in 32 games, and helped his side to China's equivalent of the FA Cup final.
With Spurs' starting 11 generally made up of young, relatively inexperienced players, Mourinho is thought to be keen to add some more senior members to his squad, although he recently ruled out a move for another of his former players, the 38-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The Chinese league does not re-start until the end of February or beginning of March, meaning Fellaini has some time to consider his future and weigh up his options.
Despite rumours suggesting Mourinho is looking to bring in at least one or two new players in January, reports have claimed chairman Daniel Levy will not allow him to spend much money in the winter transfer window, with big repayments needed on Spurs' new stadium.
It remains to be seen whether Shandong Luneng demand a big transfer fee for Fellaini, but it is certainly a move which would be an interesting one to keep an eye on, with Mourinho and Fellaini known to have a good relationship stemming from their two-and-a-half years working together at United.
Spurs are next back in action in the Champions League against Bayern Munich on Wednesday, although they are expected to put out a youthful team having already secured qualification for the knockout stages.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Guardiola admits Manchester City standards have slipped</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MANCHESTER (United Kingdom): Pep Guardiola says Manchester City may no longer be able to match the standards of the best teams after a painful defeat against Manchester United left them 14 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
Guardiola's City have been the Premier League's outstanding side over the past two years, clocking up 100 points in 2017/18 and retaining the title last term during their treble-winning campaign.
Guardiola hopes City, who have now lost four of their 16 league games this season, will be able to learn from their setbacks.
"United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counter-attack and you have to accept that," said the City boss.
"That is the level we face against Liverpool, United, Barcelona, Madrid, Juventus. They are the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them.
"We have to improve and accept it and move forward. Maybe we need to live that as a club to improve, to accept the reality now and improve."
Guardiola, however, is not ready to give up on his side's title defence and there is also plenty more to play for in the remainder of the campaign.
City have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League ahead of Wednesday's final group game against Dinamo Zagreb, are through to the League Cup quarter-finals and have a kind draw for the start of their FA Cup defence next month.
"The reality is we are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially, as well, the things we cannot control," said Guardiola. "That is the reality but we have to continue.
"We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play in and other games to fight and improve on. Maybe this is going to help us for the future so we need to live this as a club to be better."

"United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counter-attack and you have to accept that," said the City boss.
"That is the level we face against Liverpool, United, Barcelona, Madrid, Juventus. They are the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them.
"We have to improve and accept it and move forward. Maybe we need to live that as a club to improve, to accept the reality now and improve."
Guardiola, however, is not ready to give up on his side's title defence and there is also plenty more to play for in the remainder of the campaign.
City have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League ahead of Wednesday's final group game against Dinamo Zagreb, are through to the League Cup quarter-finals and have a kind draw for the start of their FA Cup defence next month.
"The reality is we are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially, as well, the things we cannot control," said Guardiola. "That is the reality but we have to continue.
"We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play in and other games to fight and improve on. Maybe this is going to help us for the future so we need to live this as a club to be better."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harington Reacts to Golden Globe Nom: "I'm the Loner Throner"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In Game of Thrones' sixth season, Kit Harington's Jon Snow, recently brought back to life, stood with sword in hand facing down an army of enemies all on his own. The "Battle of the Bastards" war hero survived that day, and indeed survived the entire series — and for Harington, the actor is once again hitting the battlefield by himself, this time at the 2020 Golden Globes, the lone nominee for Thrones' final season.
"I'm the 'loner Throner,' it seems," Harington tells The Hollywood Reporter about his nomination, the only one Thrones received for its eighth and final season. "I just imagine myself sitting down at a table all by myself as the 'loner Throner!'"
Nominated in the best actor category alongside the likes of Succession star Brian Cox and Mr. Robot lead Rami Malek, Harington's nomination for the final Thrones season marks the actor's first ever Golden Globes nomination. Calling in from "the cold and wet streets of London," Harington says he was at home when the nominations rolled out, blissfully unaware "that it was so early in the U.S." (As he puts it: "I'm looking forward to sunny L.A., I'll tell you that much.")
"I didn't expect to be nominated," says Harington. "I thought the show might be, but I was just at home, learning lines, and then my publicists called. It was very unexpected and wonderful."
"Every time I go to say goodbye to this show, something comes along that reminds me of the story of it," he adds. "This is one of those moments. I have to say thanks to the HFPA for nominating me. We spent a lot of years with this thing. Obviously, I dearly loved it. I loved every moment of it. I loved the character. It's a weird feeling, but I feel kind of happy for him, the character, if that makes sense."
The rightful ruler of Westeros by bloodline if not desire, Harington's Jon Snow ended Game of Thrones alive, as far away from the King's Landing political machine as possible: the far North, well beyond the Wall, walking into the Haunted Forest alongside Free Folk and fellow members of the Night's Watch. It was not an entirely happy ending for the character, who plunged a dagger into the heart of Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in that final hour, but it was one Harington feels Snow very much earned. 
"For me, that's the perfect ending for him," he says. "It's where I wanted him to be. I didn't want him on the throne, and I didn't want him to be dead. I wanted him to be in the North, where he belongs. My feeling is where he ended in the show is exactly where he should have ended. There was a full-circledness to it. This [nomination] feels full circle, too. It's a lovely way to say goodbye to the character. It's a lovely way to say goodbye to the show. It's perfect, in my book."
Of course, as the sole Thrones nominee heading into Golden Globes night, Harington acknowledges some missing ingredients for the completely perfect ending: "Obviously, I'm sad I'm not going to be there with Emilia, Peter [Dinklage], the rest of the cast, or [David Benioff and Dan Weiss]… obviously, I wanted everyone to be nominated, and I feel like they should, as anyone who loves their show and loves their cast and crew would feel and want. I'm happy for my nomination, and I'd love the show to be represented [more], but it won an Emmy, and it wasn't nominated for a Globe. So I'll represent the show on my own. I'll do my best."
As for anyone who thinks the former Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and King in the North suddenly has unexpected open space at the Game of Thrones table on Golden Globes night? Think again.
"If [the cast and crew] can't make it, I'm just going to reserve the seats for no one," he says. "I think it's important that I look like I'm on my own." To riff on what one of his character's closest companions once said: "You know no one, Jon Snow."

    <h5 class="mb-1">London Bridge terror attack: Ex-convict sprayed fire extinguisher into Usman Khan's eyes so that man with narwhal tusk could stab him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former convict who tackled the London Bridge terrorist has revealed how he used a fire extinguisher in an attempt to blind Usman Khan so that a man wielding a narwahl tusk could stab him. 
John Crilly, who served 13 years in prison for murder before his sentence was quashed, was one of a group of people to take down Khan, who killed two people on November 29. 
Mr Crilly, 48, was convicted of murdering 71-year-old Augustine Maduemezia, but his conviction was rescinded after a Supreme Court ruling on joint enterprise law and he was released in 2018.
The court ruled the law on joint enterprise - where defendants were prosecuted for murder even if they did not strike the fatal blow - had been misinterpreted.
He told the Daily Mirror that he used the foam from a fire extinguisher he picked up at Fishmongers Hall as a weapon against Khan, who was wearing a hoax suicide belt.
"At first, I thought throw that at him, then I thought I could spray it and soak the belt, maybe short-circuit the belt," he said.
"I started spraying him and it seemed to do the job. I was spraying it in his eyes...he can’t see and that gives the whale guy a chance to give him a poke." 
Video footage from the terror attack shows a bystander holding a narwhal tusk, which had been ripped from a wall inside Fishmongers Hall where Khan, Mr Crilly and others were taking part in a prisoner rehabilitation conference. 
This is where Khan started his rampage, and Mr Crilly has shed light on the details of what happened inside the venue before the terrorist was chased out onto the street where he was shot dead by police. 
He told the Daily Mirror: "At the bottom of the stairs stood Usman Khan with his two knives out jumping about like a mad man. It didn’t take too long to realise what was going on.
"Without stereotyping, he had a big beard, two knives, shouting ‘Allahu akbar’. He was wearing a suicide belt."
Mr Crilly also said that an armed Khan told them: "I'm going to kill you all," before lunging at crowds with his knives.
Talking about the burglary in Manchester that went wrong and ended with one of his co-defendants killing a pensioner with a single punch, he said: "My life has been spent wishing that day never happened."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 10 biggest takeaways from NFL week 14: 49ers steal instant classic and Rams discover their horns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We’re in the endgame now, folks. There are just three weeks left of regular season action, as week 14 threw playoff standings into doubt in both the AFC and NFC.
Four huge fixtures failed to disappoint, but there was plenty to talk about in this week’s ‘lesser’ games too. Here are the 10 biggest takeaways from Sunday’s match-ups...
We hoped this would be a slobberknocker between two of the NFC’s very best, and we were not let down. The San Francisco 49ers edged the New Orleans Saints 48-46 thanks to a Robbie Gould field goal as time expired when the Saints thought - or at least hoped - they had won it when Tre’Quan Smith ran in a touchdown with less than a minute remaining.
Both quarterbacks were excellent in this one, combining for 10 total touchdowns (six for Drew Brees, five passing one rushing, and four for Jimmy Garoppolo), while Emmanuel Sanders added another through the air on a trick play. Sanders wreaked havoc all game, finishing with seven catches for 157 yards and a score, to go with that TD pass. He was helped by another strong performance from Raheem Mostert (averaging 6.9 yards per carry) on the ground.
This game treated us to a delightful back and forth, with Brees opening the affair with four straight touchdown drives, before Garoppolo led three straight to steal the lead before the half. Two of the league’s best defenses were regularly torched, showing there is rarely substitute for barn-burning offense in the modern NFL. San Francisco’s win - plus Seattle’s defeat - puts them back in charge in the NFC West, while New Orleans have dropped out of a playoff bye (for now).
Los Angeles Rams fans must be wondering if it’s too little too late, after a second straight excellent performance saw them comprehensively take down the soaring Seattle Seahawks 28-12. At 8-5 the Rams are still well in the NFC playoff hunt, but may need to win out to get there. If they keep playing like this it would be a shame to see them miss out.
Jared Goff (22 of 31, 293 yards, two TDs, two INTs) again looked to Tyler Higbee (seven catches, 116 yards) and Robert Woods (seven catches, 98 yards, TD) in the passing game, while Todd Gurley’s usage continued to improve - perhaps LA had been saving him for the late-season? Gurley rushed 23 times for 79 yards and a score, and added 34 more from four receptions to go over 100.
While the Rams moved the ball well and were efficient in the red zone, they owe much of this victory to their defense. They sacked Russell Wilson (22 of 36, 245 yards, INT) five times and picked him off once on a rare difficult night for the MVP candidate, and matters were made worse for Seattle when running back Rashaad Penny, who was just starting to look worthy of his first-round selection, went down with a torn ACL. The Seahawks slip out of top spot in the NFC West and out of a playoff bye with this defeat. Week 17 against the Niners is going to be huge.
The New England Patriots don’t tend to lose in December, but they’ve now lost two in a row against fellow AFC contenders, and once again they have their ailing offense to blame. The Pats could only muster 16 points against the Chiefs, falling 23-16 for their first home defeat in 22 games. Barring disaster they will still win the AFC East and look good for a bye, but if they cannot fix the offense it’s hard to see New England beating teams like these Chiefs and the Ravens come January.
The Pats, to be fair, got very unlucky with the officiating in this game, and had two likely touchdowns wiped out by bad calls. First, Travis Kelce was ruled down by contact when Devin McCourty forced a fumble which Stephon Gilmore was beginning to return to the house. The refs awarded the fumble on review, but Gilmore’s return had to come back. Then, late in the game, N’Keal Harry was incorrectly ruled out of bounds as he reached for the pylon, and Bill Belichick had no challenges left to try to reverse the call.
The Chiefs essentially won this game in the first half, going into the break with a 20-7 lead. Patrick Mahomes (26 of 40, 283 yards, TD, INT) comfortably outdueled Tom Brady (19 of 36, 169 yards, TD, INT) despite barely having a running game to lean on. Mecole Hardman’s 48-yard touchdown sprint was the highlight for the Kansas City offense, but it was a defensive play - a big pass break up from Bashaud Breeland late in the fourth quarter - which sealed the win.
Lamar Jackson is now just the second quarterback to ever rush for more than 1,000 yards in a single season, and had three games to pick up the handful of yards that will take him past Michael Vick’s record of 1,039. Jackson carried 11 times for 40 in a defensive 24-17 win over the Buffalo Bills, keeping the Baltimore Ravens on top in the AFC.
Jackson was efficient passing the ball, completing 16 of 25 for 145 yards, three touchdowns (to Nick Boyle, Hayden Hurst and Willie Snead) and an interception, but it was the Baltimore defense which shone. They sacked Josh Allen six times and held the Bills to just 209 yards on offense. The longer this season goes on, the more the Ravens are looking like the complete package, and the more they are looking like the team which might be celebrating with the Lombardi trophy in Miami.
What a disaster for the Houston Texans. They found themselves 38-3 down to the Denver Broncos early in the third quarter, and by then it was too late even for Deshaun Watson to mount such a large comeback. The Broncos stunned Houston from the offset, scoring on each of their first five possessions, as Drew Lock turned in another impressive performance which will give him hope of earning the starting QB job for next season. He finished an effective 22 of 27 for 309 yards, three touchdowns and an interception, connecting well with fellow rookie Noah Fant, who went for 113 yards and a touchdown from four catches.
Watson threw the ball 50 times in a desperate attempt to claw a result from nowhere, but two of the Texans’ three touchdowns came with his legs. He also threw two picks - which happens when you toss the ball so many times - one of which former Texans Kareem Jackson returned to the house. Houston’s place atop the AFC South is now in doubt...
The team who may steal it from them? The Tennessee Titans, who blew out an opponent for the third straight week - this time a 42-21 win over the Oakland Raiders. It’s hard to think of the perennially 9-7 Titans as a ‘good’ team, but that’s exactly what they’ve been since Ryan Tannehill took over at quarterback. He was on top form again, with 391 yards and three touchdowns, one of which was a 91-yard blitz from rookie receiver AJ Brown. He’s getting plenty of support from Mr December, Derrick Henry, who had 103 yards and two touchdowns from 18 carries.
For a while the Raiders looked like they might be one of the stories of the season, after a mid-season hot streak put them right in the AFC playoff picture, but Sunday’s defeat leaves them praying for a miracle. A January run would have been a magical way to cap their final season in Oakland, and while 6-7 is a marked improvement on the dross they turned out for much of last year, it is a shame their final game in the city is now unlikely to have any real January ramifications.
The Pittsburgh Steelers’ brilliant defense took down Kyler Murray’s Arizona Cardinals, holding them to little over 200 yards of offense in a 23-17 win that moves them to 8-5 after an 0-3 start. Pittsburgh sacked Murray five times, Joe Haden picked him off twice (including the game sealing interception late on), and TJ Watt added another at the goal line as they swarmed like angry bees all over Kliff Klingsbury’s attack. 
The Steelers’ offense may be deeply limited, but alongside this D all it needs to do is be efficient, and they achieved that on Sunday. Devlin Hodges went 16 of 19 for 152 yards and a score, though the lack of run game in the absence of James Conner continues to be a problem. It didn’t matter much here, thanks in part to Diontae Johnson’s 85-yard punt return helping Pittsburgh to an early lead they never surrendered. This is not the Steelers team we have been used to in recent years, but Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and company missed the playoffs last year. Duck Hodges’ men aren’t going to make the same mistake.
The Green Bay Packers now have possession of a bye in the NFC - at least for now - after a 20-15 victory over the Washington Redskins. The offense didn’t really roll on Sunday, but it was able to lean on Aaron Jones, whose electric form continued with 192 scrimmage yards and a touchdown from 22 touches. Jones led the team in rushing and receiving, averaging 8.4 per carry on the ground. He is becoming a bona fide star in Matt LaFleur’s offense, which only goes to show Mike McCarthy up for forcing him to split carries with Jamaal Williams for so long.
For Washington, Dwayne Haskins is yet to really convince under centre, and was sacked four more times here, taking his tally to 26 from just four games. He also has seven interceptions to just three touchdowns - the kind of numbers which may tempt this team to look elsewhere with the incoming high draft pick in a strong QB class next spring.
We heard this week that Philip Rivers has been in danger of losing his job in Los Angeles. He was relieved of his duties on Sunday, but that was only because he rolled back the clock - on his 38th birthday - to rip apart the Jacksonville Jaguars, and could be afforded a rest with the game comfortably won. 
Rivers went 16 of 22 for 314 yards and three touchdowns before Tyrod Taylor came in and added another score, capping off a 45-10 win which also belonged in part to Austin Ekeler. Ekeler had more than 200 yards from scrimmage and also added a touchdown from just 12 touches. Jacksonville game up more than 200 yards on the ground for the fourth time this season - a fatal flaw for a team not good enough to handle one.
Jameis Winston had the ultimate Jameis Winston game on Sunday (I feel like I’ve said that a lot this season), throwing for 456 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions (two to Darius Leonard) in an enjoyable 38-35 Tampa Bay Buccaneers win over the Indianapolis Colts. Winston orchestrated the winning drive late on, one which all but ends the Colts’ season, showing flashes of brilliance alongside the infuriating mistakes which are a hallmark of his game.
Leonard’s two picks (one of which he took 80 yards for a touchdown) kept the Colts in this game. They need far more firepower on offense if they are to help Jacoby Brissett succeed next year. Marcus Johnson did have 105 yards and a touchdown from just three receptions, but Indy’s receiver corps turns into a game of Guess Who? Whenever TY Hilton is out injured. In the end they have paid the price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everton investigating reports of homophobic chanting during win over Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everton are investigating reports of homophobic chanting during Saturday's Premier League game against Chelsea.
The abuse is alleged to have been directed at Chelsea fans during Everton's 3-1 win at Goodison Park.
"Everton is working in conjunction with Kick It Out and has commenced an investigation into homophobic chanting reported during Saturday's Premier League game against Chelsea," a club statement said.
"Both the club and Kick It Out have received reports of a homophobic chant being aimed at Chelsea's fans by a small section of the home crowd.
"Homophobia has no place within our stadium, our club, our community or our game. The club strongly condemns such behaviour and is carrying out a thorough investigation which will include liaison with Merseyside Police.
"Matchgoers who have information relating to any form of discrimination should email reportit@evertonfc.com."
The alleged abuse came during a week in which the Premier League has backed Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport.
Earlier on Sunday, a 41-year-old man was arrested in connection with allegations of racist abuse during Saturday's Manchester derby.
A video circulated on social media appeared to show a Manchester City supporter aiming monkey chants towards Manchester United players during the Red Devils' 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium.
City swiftly issued a statement after the match saying the club was working with Greater Manchester Police, who announced on Sunday morning that the man had been arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Yoko Ono describes 'hollowing experience' of losing John Lennon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday (8 December) marked the 39th anniversary of the death of John Lennon, with family, friends and fans all paying fresh tribute to the late Beatle.
Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono posted an emotional tribute to the musician on Twitter in which she described the process of losing a loved one as ‘a hollowing experience’.
‘After 39 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him,’ Yoko wrote, referencing Lennon’s two sons before quoting one of the most famous lyrics from Imagine: ‘Imagine all the people, living life in peace.’
Yoko also took a renewed stand against gun violence in the US, pulling up a statistic which claimed that over 1.4 million people have been killed a a result of gun violence in the US since Lennon’s murder in New York in December 1980.
‘Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed with guns,’ she wrote. ‘We are turning this beautiful country into a War Zone.
‘Together, let’s bring back America, the green land of Peace.’
Six hours on from her original post, Yoko heartbreakingly added: ‘It is always good to cry. Tears gives you immense health.’
Last month, Lennon’s Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr recalled being told the devastating news of Lennon’s murder, admitting that he ‘still well[s] up that some b*****d shot him’.
‘We got a plane to New York, and you don’t know what you can do,’ the drummer said about what he did in the immediate aftermath of Lennon’s death.
‘We went to the apartment. “Anything we can do?” And Yoko just said, “Well, you just play with Sean. Keep Sean busy.” And that’s what we did.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">John Lennon’s wife Yoko Ono has marked the 39th anniversary of the Beatles legend death by revealing she still feels “hollow” and misses him daily.
Lennon was shot outside the couple’s Dakota Building apartment in New York on December 8, 1980, and Ono says she and his sons still struggle with the untimely death of their beloved husband and father, reports aceshowbiz.com.
“After 39 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him. The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience,” she wrote on Twitter.
She went on to call on American politicians to change US gun laws, adding: “Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed with guns. We are turning this beautiful country into a War Zone. Together, let’s bring back America, the green land of peace.”
She also shared a statistic that said over 1,400,000 people have been killed by guns in America since Lennon’s death.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MANCHESTER
Harry Maguire has the top four in his crosshairs after Manchester United's thrilling derby triumph at Manchester City lifted them to fifth in the Premier League table.
A week that started with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer under pressure after a below-par performance in a home draw against promoted Aston Villa ended with a second memorable victory in a matter of days.
Fresh from deservedly seeing off Jose Mourinho's Tottenham 2-1 on Wednesday, United won by the same scoreline at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday thanks to a breathtaking start and impressive gameplan.
Solskjaer's side could have added to goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in a fine first half that laid the foundation for the 2-1 victory, which moved them to within five points of fourth-placed Chelsea.
"I think you need to look after your own results, don't look elsewhere, keep winning games," said Maguire, the world's most expensive defender.
"We've won back-to-back games against Spurs and City. We've got another big game next week now (at home to Everton).
"The top four is in sight but we just keep looking after our own results, keep trying to get the three points and keep improving."
United struggled to score goals in the early months of the season but Rashford, Martial and the fleet-footed Daniel James showed they can scare any side on Saturday.
"Over the last month or so, I feel like as a defender I look at the forwards and think they're going to score goals," Maguire told MUTV.
"At the start of the season we didn't really score more than one goal in a game but now I think it's a few games on the spin where we're back to scoring goals.
"They're a big threat, they're top players, great talent and I think it's all coming together now."
United are unbeaten in five Premier League matches and have secured their first back-to-back league wins since March.
There is a growing confidence within Solskjaer's squad and Maguire is targeting more improvements after captaining the side to victory in the blue half of Manchester.
"We feel like this year we haven't got results in some games where we feel we deserved the three points," he said.
"I think the last two games, I don't think anyone can question that we've deserved both victories."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Maguire says top four in sight for improving Manchester United</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MANCHESTER (United Kingdom): Harry Maguire has the top four in his crosshairs after Manchester United's thrilling derby triumph at Manchester City lifted them to fifth in the Premier League table.
A week that started with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer under pressure after a below-par performance in a home draw against promoted Aston Villa ended with a second memorable victory in a matter of days.
Fresh from deservedly seeing off Jose Mourinho's Tottenham 2-1 on Wednesday, United won by the same scoreline at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday thanks to a breathtaking start and impressive gameplan.
Solskjaer's side could have added to goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in a fine first half that laid the foundation for the 2-1 victory, which moved them to within five points of fourth-placed Chelsea.
"I think you need to look after your own results, don't look elsewhere, keep winning games," said Maguire, the world's most expensive defender.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Subprime lender Amigo’s chief executive and chairman quit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The chief executive and chairman of Amigo, Britain’s dominant provider of guarantor loans, have resigned in the latest sign of tumult at the high-cost credit provider that once commanded a stock market valuation of more than £1bn.
James Benamor, a self-confessed former petty criminal who founded Amigo in his twenties and briefly became an on-paper billionaire after its initial public offering, reasserted control of the business.
Chief executive Hamish Paton announced his resignation on Monday, less than two weeks after he declared the company was making good progress in its turnround efforts. Chairman Stephan Wilcke will also step down ahead of the company’s next annual meeting, and Clare Salmon — chair of the remuneration committee — will leave “at the first suitable opportunity”.
One person close to the company said the resignations followed a disagreement about strategy.
John Cronin, analyst at Goodbody, said: “The chair and CEO shared a view on Amigo’s strategic direction and there seems to be some disagreement with the founder.”
He added that Mr Benamor was “clearly unhappy with the share price performance in recent months and feels he needs to take more control”.
Amigo’s shares have lost about three-quarters of their value since the company went public in June 2018, but rose 13 per cent on Monday to 68.2p. The company’s market capitalisation has fallen from £1.3bn at its IPO to £325m.
Amigo and Richmond Group, Mr Benamor’s investment vehicle, declined to comment.
Mr Benamor, who owns 61 per cent of Amigo, quit the board shortly after the IPO, but will rejoin as a non-executive director immediately, subject to the completion of legal formalities. Kelly Black, an executive at Mr Benamor’s investment vehicle Richmond Group, will also join Amigo as a non-executive director.
Amigo lends to borrowers with bad credit histories if they have a friend or family member who can step in if they fail to repay. It controls the vast majority of the guarantor lending market and has grown rapidly in recent years due in part to a clampdown on alternatives such as payday loans. However, the FCA has questioned whether guarantors fully understand the risks they take on, whether the lender’s 49.9 per cent interest rates are too high, and whether it traps customers into persistent debt.
Mr Paton said shortly after he became chief executive that the company would overhaul its model to reduce its reliance on repeat borrowers and tighten its credit checking policies. The announcement, in August, caused Amigo’s share price to halve in a single day, but Mr Paton said the changes were essential to put the company on “firmer foundations”.
Amigo had also been considering further changes such as reducing interest rates for borrowers who have more creditworthy guarantors.
Speaking after the group reported its interim results last month, Mr Paton said Amigo was in a “better place in terms of clarity and business going forward”, but cautioned that “the FCA are continuing to look at a number of different areas across the alternative finance space”.
Mr Benamor’s Richmond Group declined to comment. Amigo said Mr Wilcke decided it would be “more appropriate” for the company to have a new chair, but declined to comment further on the reasons for the departures. Mr Paton declined to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">North Korea calls Trump ‘erratic old man’ after tweets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The comments came after Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un would not want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders.
North Korea has insulted US President Donald Trump, calling him a “heedless and erratic old man”.
The insult comes after Mr Trump tweeted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would not want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders and affect the American presidential election by resuming hostile acts.
A senior North Korean official, former nuclear negotiator Kim Yong Chol, said that his country would not cave in to US pressure because it has nothing to lose and accused the Trump administration of attempting to buy time ahead of an end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un for Washington to salvage nuclear talks.
On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted: “Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way … North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearise as promised.”
He was referring to a vague statement issued by the two leaders during their first summit in Singapore in June last year that called for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when or how it would occur.
Mr Trump added that Mr Kim “does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November.”
Kim Yong Chol said Mr Trump’s tweets clearly show that he is an irritated old man “bereft of patience”.
“As (Trump) is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we cannot but call him a ‘dotard’ again may come,” Kim Yong Chol said.
“Trump has too many things that he does not know about (North Korea). We have nothing more to lose. Though the US may take away anything more from us, it can never remove the strong sense of self-respect, might and resentment against the U.S. from us.”
Kim Yong Chol travelled to Washington and met with the US president twice last year while setting up the summits with Kim Jong Un.
The latest war of words came as diplomats said the US had changed its mind and is now refusing to sign a letter that would have authorised the UN Security Council to hold a meeting on the human rights situation in North Korea.
Without support from Washington, the diplomats said European and other supporters of holding a meeting cannot go ahead because they are one vote short of the minimum nine “yes” votes required.
Nuclear negotiations faltered after a February meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim in Vietnam broke down when the US side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.
Mr Kim has said North Korea will seek a “new way” if the US maintains its sanctions and pressure, and issued the deadline for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim met for a third time in June at the border between the two Koreas and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity winner Jacqueline Jossa doing 'fine' after 'tough time' in jungle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa is doing "fine" after her win, according to runner-up Andy Whyment.
The Coronation Street actor, who plays Kirk Sutherland on the ITV soap, revealed the former EastEnders actress had a "tough time" in the jungle.
Jacqueline broke down in tears as Ant and Dec crowned her Queen of the Jungle on Sunday night.
She then had an emotional reunion with husband Dan Osborne on the bridge, before finally being reunited with her two young daughters Ella and Mia at the hotel.
Andy and co-star Kate Garraway appeared on Good Morning Britain on Monday morning to discuss the final.
Fresh from the news that Jacqueline had cancelled all live TV interviews following her win, because of other filming and wanting to spend time with her family, Andy praised the star.
He said she was "fine" but "dazed" after winning the series, as he referenced her "tough time" in the jungle.
Andy told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: "She’s fine, we’ve just done some filming for the Coming Out show.
"She looks fine, she's got a magnificent dress on and she's still got her crown on. She had a tough time in there at times, she’s done really well."
Kate added that viewers will love the sweet moment when Jacqueline sees her children for the first time.
It comes after reports earlier on in the series, that Jacqueline's campmate Myles Stephenson spoke to her about rumours his ex Gabby Allen had slept with her husband Dan.
The fling claims emerged after pictures of the pair together at a bootcamp last year, with Dan and Gabby fiercely denying anything ever happened between them.
Jacqueline is said to have been threatening to quit the series after Myles apparently told her what he believed happened between Gabby and Dan.
Towards the end of the series, Dan was faced with fresh cheating claims by former CelebrityBig Brother co-star Chloe Ayling , who claimed she had a "threesome" with him and Natalie Nunn .
Dan hit back at the claims, denying anything happened, as he shared mass support for his wife online ahead of her win.
As the pair reunited on the bridge, Dan picked a sobbing Jacqueline up and embraced her, before the couple smiled for photos.
He then joined her as they made their way back to the hotel, where she ran to meet her young daughters who were waiting with her parents.
I'm A Celebrity's Coming Out show airs Thursday night at 9pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity's Jacqueline Jossa first winner to cancel live TV interviews</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an unexpected first for the show, Jacqueline Jossa looks set to be the first I'm a Celebrity winner not to take part in live TV interviews following her big win on Sunday night.
In a major upset to bookies who had runner-up Andy Whyment as the odds on favourite to triumph in the final, Eastenders actress Jacqueline topped the public vote and looked stunned at being announced as winner by Ant and Dec.
Jacqueline's victory, while well received by plenty of people who heralded her a well deserving winner, didn't go down too well with others who thought Andy should have won.
Some angry fans have even gone as far as saying the result was fixed.
Once the dust has settled on their jungle win and they've enjoyed a bit of R&R, it is customary for I'm A Celebrity champions to take part in a series of live TV interviews, on the likes of GMB and This Morning, but according to The Mirror,Jacqueline has decided against doing them.
A source close to Jacqueline has told Mirror Online that she has chosen to spend time with her kids, with her also busy filming for ITV.
They said: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.
"Jacqueline and Dan (husband) spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."
While she was getting stuck into everything jungle life had to throw at her, Jacqueline's TOWIE star husband Dan had to deny cheating claims from model Chloe Ayling, who he appeared in Celebrity Big Brother with in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson is an enemy to football and Gary Neville did not go far enough when condemning prime minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville did not go far enough. The Tories are the enemies of football. If Boris Johnson is given a working majority in Parliament on Thursday in the General Election, stadiums across the country will become more toxic. Neville pointed the finger at the Prime Minister after Fred, the Manchester United midfielder, was allegedly racially abused by a Manchester City fan at the Etihad on Saturday night. It was brave and necessary criticism from the former United full back. Johnson has a long history of making racist comments. It is hard to imagine how a man who wrote “tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles” came to lead a multicultural nation. He uses the language of the 19th century - not the 21st.
Yet over the past three years, since he got a sniff of Downing Street, the old Etonian has in my opinion upped the ante. Johnson appears to have deliberately sought to appeal to some of the worst characteristics of British culture. The 41-year-old man who was arrested after appearing to gesticulate in an offensive manner at the Manchester derbyappears to be precisely Johnson’s target market. Hell, if the Prime Minister can refer to black people as “piccaninnies,” what’s wrong with a monkey gesture? To me, it feels as though Johnson and his ‘bad boys of Brexit’ cronies have legitimised casual hate in a way that seemed unthinkable a decade ago.
It was sickening to see John Barnes in the company of the Conservative leader on Saturday at the Seashell Trust in Cheadle. Johnson was there to publicise the manifesto pledge to bring the World Cup to the UK and Ireland in 2030 and the promise to put £550 million into the grassroots game. Barnes, who ran the gauntlet of racist thugs throughout his playing career, has always taken a somewhat idiosyncratic approach to confronting bigotry. In normal circumstances it would have been a welcome development to see someone of Barnes’s experience meet the Prime Minister to explain what black players and people suffer on a daily basis. In the midst of an election campaign, however, it seemed like an endorsement. Just stand there for the photo op, John, and dazzle the cameras with that smile. My stomach turned watching it.
The former Watford and Liverpool winger was at his peak when a Tory government showed the most naked contempt for football and its fans. Margaret Thatcher, the demented patron saint of brutish Conservativism, hated the game. Under her regime in the 1980s, supporters were demonised and criminalised. How bad was it? After the Bradford Fire where 56 people died in a decrepit tinderbox of a stand at Valley Parade in 1985, The Sunday Times opined that football was “a slum sport played in slum stadiums increasingly watched by slum people, who deter decent folk from turning up.” This was not a reaction to hooliganism. It was a response to the deaths of innocent people in a completely avoidable inferno.
It is an accurate reflection of how Thatcherite acolytes viewed the game. Football was a working-class pursuit and one of the themes of the 80s was the assault on working-class culture. Supporters were part of Thatcher’s “enemy within,” to be monitored with identity cards and policed with a presumption that they were inclined to violence. These thought processes led to Hillsborough and allowed those in authority responsible for the 1989 disaster to believe that they could avoid any accountability for their behaviour. It turned out that they were right and there were no consequences for those who caused the deaths of 96 people.
Thatcher’s most famous assertion was “there is no society.” Her disciples claim the statement does not quite mean what it says. You have to understand the context, they claim. Well that’s nonsense. The so-called Iron Lady believed that individuals only had responsibility to themselves and their family. That in part explained why she could not understand football and why she feared it. Clubs grew out of churches, factories and workers’ associations and, even now, the sport remains underpinned by community spirit. It proves there is society
Johnson appears to have inherited Thatcher’s disdain for the game and her suspicion of civic togetherness. The evidence is clear in the infamous Spectator leader published during his editorship in 2004 after the murder of Kenneth Bigley by Jihadis in Iraq. The article talked of “tribal grievances.” We have already seen Johnson use the word “tribal” to imply that Africans are uncivilised. Now it was applied to football fans. The next paragraph expanded the thought. It said: “The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon.”
Johnson did not write this editorial – it is not uncommon for columnists to get someone else to pen their copy for them – but I believe it accurately reflected his views. The belief that the lower orders are predisposed to dangerous, alcohol-fuelled madness when they go the match is deeply ingrained in the Conservative psyche. It lingers today. And it was never just about Liverpool. The likes of Johnson hold their noses whenever they come across football supporters, no matter which part of the country the fans are from.
There are bigger issues at play in this crucial election – the future of the National Health Service, peace in Ireland, Britain’s relationship with Europe – but make no mistake: if Johnson wins, it is my belief that the experience of watching football live will deteriorate.
Racists and bigots will be empowered. Instead of accepting culpability for creating an environment where obscene attitudes thrive, Johnson and those around him will look down their noses at the perpetrators and attribute uncivilised behaviour to the unspeakable lower classes.
The mood of the game reflects the health of the country. Too many incidents over the past few years have shown a racist poison is growing stronger in the stands. Neville is correct to call the Prime Minister to account. The state is sick and in my view electing Johnson will make the illness even more vile. The nation deserves better – and so does football.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julia Louis-Dreyfus says people took ‘crazy drugs’ when she worked on SNL</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Julia Louis-Dreyfus has claimed people working on Saturday Night Live “were doing crazy drugs” during her tenure on the show.
The actor and comedian, who appeared on SNL between 1982 and 1985, also claimed the programme was “very sexist” at the time.
“I was unbelievably naive and I didn’t really understand how the dynamics of the place worked,” she told Stephen Colbert at a Q&A during the Montclair Film Festival.
“It was very sexist, very sexist. People were doing crazy drugs at the time. I was oblivious. I just thought, ‘Oh wow. He’s got a lot of energy.'”
When she joined the NBC variety show in 1982, Louis-Dreyfus became SNL’s youngest female cast member at that time and shared the stage with Eddie Murphy, Martin Short and Billy Crystal, among others.
“It was a pretty brutal time, but it was a very informative time for me,” she added.
“I learned I wasn’t going to do any more of this show-business crap unless it was fun,” she said. “I don’t have to walk and crawl through this kind of nasty glass if it’s not ultimately going to be fulfilling, and so that’s how I sort of moved forward from that moment.
"I sort of applied that ‘fun metre’ to every job I’ve had since and that has been very helpful.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rene Auberjonois death: Star Trek family pays tribute as Deep Space Nine actor dies, aged 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Trek: Deep Space Nineactor Rene Auberjonois has died, aged 79.
The prolific character actor, who also starred in sitcom Benson and Robert Altman film MASH (1970), died of metastatic lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles, his son Remy-Luc Auberjonois told PA.
Auberjonois' career spanned five decades, beginning with theatre in the 1960s before moving on to films in the 1970s and television shows in the 1980s.
He frequently collaborated with Altman, starring in his films McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971) and Images (1972).
In Benson – the ABC series whose title character was a butler played by Robert Guillaume – he played Clayton Runnymede Endicott III, the chief of staff at a governor’s mansion. 
For science-fiction fans and convention-goers ever since, he was Odo, the shape-shifting Changeling and head of space-station security on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
“I am all of those characters, and I love that,” Auberjonois said in a 2011 interview with the Star Trek website.
“I also run into people, and they think I’m their cousin or their dry cleaner. I love that, too.”
Auberjonois' Star Trek family, including his Boston Legal co-star William Shatner and George Takei, led tributes to the actor.
Takei called the actor's death "a real loss," writing: "Star Trek fans knew him as Odo from Deep Space Nine. We knew him as Rene. He was a wonderful, caring, and intelligent man. He shall be missed. When I look out to the stars, I shall think of you, friend."
Shatner wrote: "To sum up his life in a tweet is nearly impossible. To Judith, Tessa & Remy I send you my love and strength. I will keep you in my thoughts and remember a wonderful friendship with Rene."
Other stars to pay tribute include Gates McFadden, Larry Nemecek, Robert Hewitt Wolfe and Armin Shimerman.
Auberjonois'  was born in New York in 1940, the son of Fernand Auberjonois, Swiss-born foreign correspondent for US newspapers, and the grandson of a Swiss post-impressionist painter also named Rene Auberjonois.
After graduating from college at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon, Auberjonois hopped around the country joining theatre companies, eventually landing three roles on Broadway in 1968, including playing the Fool in a long-running version of King Lear.
The following year he would play Sebastian Baye opposite Katharine Hepburn in Coco, a play on the life of designer Coco Chanel that would earn him a Tony for best actor in a leading role in a musical.
He received Tony nominations for 1973’s The Good Doctor, 1984’s Big River, and 1989’s City of Angels.
Auberjonois' other film credits include the 1976 version of King Long, mystery thriller The Eyes of Laura Mars (1978) and Certain Women (2016).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologises for Christmas jumper 'showing Santa doing cocaine'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Walmart Canada has issued an apology for selling a jumper on its site that appears to show Santa Claus doing cocaine.
The item of clothing shows Saint Nicholas sitting behind a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him, captioned with the slogan: “Let it snow.”
The product’s description on the Walmart Canada website stated: “We all know how snow works. It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.
“That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.”
A spokesperson for Walmart has apologised for the sale of the product, adding that it has been removed from the company’s Canadian website.
 
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” the spokesperson told Global News.
“We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.”
The jumper was produced by clothing retailer Fun Wear.
Other items created by Fun Wear that are still available to purchase on Walmart’s Canadian site include a jumper depicting a mugshot of Santa Claus, a sweatshirt featuring an illustration of Santa engaged in a fight with a bear and a Chanukah sweatshirt designed with a menorah and captioned with the slogan: “Lit.”
Other items of clothing, including a sweatshirt that showed Father Christmas standing in front of a fireplace without his trousers on, have been removed from the Walmart Canada website.
A range of Christmas cards featuring the Virgin Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus recently sparked anger among members of the Christian community, who described them as “deeply offensive”.
One of the cards includes the caption: “Mary just needs to admit she slept with someone else.”
“It highlights a fundamental hypocrisy that Christianity is seen as fair game to mock, disparage and insult,” said James Mildred, communication manager of Christian Action Research and Education (CARE).
The Independent has contacted Walmart for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Over 750,000 applications for US birth certificate copies exposed online</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An online company that allows users to obtain a copy of their birth and death certificates from U.S. state governments has exposed a massive cache of applications — including their personal information.
More than 752,000 applications for copies of birth certificates were found on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage bucket. (The bucket also had 90,400 death certificate applications, but these could not be accessed or downloaded.)
The bucket wasn’t protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew the easy-to-guess web address access to the data.
Each application process differed by state, but performed the same task: allowing customers to apply to their state’s record-keeping authority — usually a state’s department of health — to obtain a copy of their historical records. The applications we reviewed contained the applicant’s name, date-of-birth, current home address, email address, phone number and historical personal information, including past addresses, names of family members and the reason for the application — such as applying for a passport or researching family history.
The applications dated back to late-2017 and the bucket was updating daily. In one week, the company added about 9,000 applications to the bucket.
U.K.-based penetration testing company Fidus Information Security found the exposed data. TechCrunch verified the data by matching names and addresses against public records.
Fidus and TechCrunch sent several emails prior to publication to warn of the exposed data, but we received only automated emails and no action was taken. We are not naming the company. When reached, Amazon would not intervene but said it would inform the customer.
We also reached out to the local data protection authority to warn of the security lapse, but it did not immediately comment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans just can't get enough of Deepika Padukone and her Instagram handle updates, they just keep on wanting more. Not just her Insta updates but special comments by her hubby Ranveer on her posts is also something fans await for with breathed breathe. Today, the actress through her social media handle, announced the trailer release of her upcoming film, 'Chhapaak' which is happening tomorrow. However, before the announcement, she treated her fans with a few throwback pictures which are noteworthy.
One of the throwback pictures which she shared has Deepika posing with her two besties and we bet you will not recognize the 'Padmaavat' actress at a first glance.
In the picture, we can see the three childhood friends, posing together. Interestingly, three of them are dressed in white and are sporting a similar hair cut which is making it more difficult for the fans to make out Deepika from the frame. However, a true Deepika fan will make out that the third girl with a sparkling smile is Deepika, who is leaning on her friends' shoulder.
This particular picture earned praises from the fans and we are waiting for Ranveer to comment on this super adorable picture of hers.
On the professional front, Deepika will be seen in Meghna Gulzar's 'Chhapaak' opposite Vikrant Massey. The film is about acid attack survivor Laxmi Aggarwal. Moreover, she will also be seen in Kabir Khan's '83' as Kapil Dev's wife Romi Bhatia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Miss South Africa crowned 2019 Miss Universe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Miss South Africa rules all.
Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss Universe Sunday night after excelling through rounds of swimsuit and evening gown struts, questions on social issues and one final chance to explain why she was the right choice.
"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me — with my kind of skin and my kind of hair — was never considered to be beautiful," she said in her last response. "I think it is time that that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face and I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."
The two runners-up for the crown were Miss Mexico and Miss Puerto Rico.
"If you do not use your beauty for your life's mission, it's just an empty ornament," Sofía Aragón, representing Mexico, said earlier in the competition.
Madison Anderson represented Puerto Rico.
"Being on the Miss Universe stage is not just a dream" Anderson said. "I believe that I found my mission. It's a representation of dedication, resilience and perseverance. I do believe my mission is to show the world that magic happens when we refuse to give up because the universe always listens to a stubborn heart."
And if you're wondering, yes, there was another mix-up and Steve Harvey was involved in it. But it was nothing like the 2015 disaster when he called out the wrong winner.
Harvey hosted the pageant for the fifth time sporting a bedazzled green and gold suit jacket.
He was commenting on a costume from earlier in week and said Miss Philippines won the National Costume Contest. But the woman standing next to him said she was Miss Malaysia.
"Y'all got to quit doing this to me," he said.
The massive competition was hosted at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.
It has already made history with Miss Myanmar, Swe Zin Htet, who says she's the first openly gay contestant.
Last year's winner, Catriona Gray from the Philippines spoke during Sunday's pageant, saying the past year has been "unforgettable, life-changing and purposeful."
"We're getting this amazing platform to voice the things we're passionate about, the things we care about," she said in a video. "I always had a voice, but Miss Universe allowed me to amplify it."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday moved further amendments to the Arms (Amendment) Bill including provision of special status to sportspersons.
"There were many discrepancies in the six-decade old law making crime control difficult," he said while introducing further amendments in Lok Sabha.
The further amendment to the Bill seeks to provide special status for sportspersons.
"Many suggestions were received. I have moved an official amendment in this regard also," he said.
The Bill was tabled in Lok Sabha on November 29. The Bill seeks to enhance punishment for illegally possessing and making prohibited arms besides other changes in the six- decade-old Arms Act.
The Arms (Amendment) Bill makes provision that a person can have a maximum of two firearms, as against the present norm of three.
Those who own more than two firearms will have to deposit the third one with authorities or authorised gun dealers within 90 days for de-licensing once the amendment is approved by Parliament, according to the bill.
As per the bill, the government proposes to amend Section 25 (1AA) of the Arms Act, 1959, to give punishment from the usual life term of 14 years to "imprisonment for the remainder of that person's life" for manufacturing, selling, repairing and possessing "prohibited" arms.
The minimum punishment under this section will be 14 years.
Under the present law, the offence invites imprisonment not be less than seven years but may extend to life imprisonment - mostly up to 14 years.
According to an estimate, India has around 35 lakh gun licences. Thirteen lakh people have licences to carry weapons in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Jammu and Kashmir, where 3.7 lakh people possess arms licences, most of which were taken in the name of personal security.
Punjab, which witnessed terrorism in 1980s and 1990s, has around 3.6 lakh active gun licences, most of which were issued during the two decades wherein militancy had engulfed the state.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Torrential rains in Uganda, 26 killed, says Red Cross</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) - At least 26 people have been killed in floods unleashed by heavy rains in different parts of Uganda, the Red Cross said on Monday as authorities urged people in affected areas to relocate.
Seventeen flooding deaths have been confirmed in the western district of Bundibugyo. Another nine people have died in the mountainous districts of Sironko and Bududa in the east, where residents also face mudslides that can destroy entire enclaves, said Irene Nakasiita, a spokeswoman for the Uganda Red Cross.
Ugandan government officials have acknowledged the continuing threat from flooding and say relief is forthcoming to affected areas. Residents are being urged to move away from areas where rivers and streams have burst their banks.
More than 6,000 people have been displaced in Bududa, a rugged area in the foothills of Mount Elgon where mudslides have killed hundreds of people over the years. Some there have resisted the government's attempts to have them relocated to lowlands elsewhere, saying they find it hard to vacate their ancestral lands.
"The risk of more flooding and landslides is real," Musa Ecweru, the government minister in charge of disasters, said in a statement Thursday.
Hundreds of acres of plantations have been destroyed and an unknown number of livestock lost in the flooding and mudslides in Bududa and Sironko, Ecweru said.
In March 2010 at least 100 people died in mudslides in Bududa, and injuries or deaths have been reported every year since then during the wet season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Study finds broadcast coverage of the UK election has aligned 'most closely' with Boris Johnson's agenda</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC and other UK broadcasters have helped Boris Johnson frame the general election on his own terms, according to an academic study of media coverage of the campaign.
The prime minister’s campaign has sought to focus the upcoming general election on the issue of “getting Brexit done” under his leadership.
Now a new study by Loughborough University suggests that broadcasters have helped him in this aim.
The researchers found that “TV coverage has focused far more on Brexit than on any other issue,” with 20% of broadcast coverage of the election focused on this theme.
This contrasts with just 8% of broadcast coverage focusing on the opposition Labour party’s central issue of the future of the National Health Service.
The authors found that “in proportional terms, TV coverage has therefore tended to align most closely with the Conservatives’ Brexit agenda.”
The study also found that the print media was overwhelmingly biased against the Labour party.
Examination of print media coverage in the first four weeks of the campaign found that Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party received broadly positive coverage, whereas Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign was portrayed in an overwhelmingly negative light.
Under UK broadcasting regulations, television and radio channels must give equal coverage to each party during a general election campaign.
However, a complaint by Labour last month about Sky News channel running its election coverage with the branding “The Brexit Election was rejected by the broadcasting regulators.
In their ruling Ofcom said that Brexit was an “important background contextual factor” in the election.
A Survation poll for ITV on Monday found that Johnson’s party had opened up a 14-point lead over Labour. The Conservatives are on 45% ahead of Labour on 31% and the Liberal Democrats on 11%.
If repeated at the general election on Thursday, this would result in a large parliamentary majority for the Conservatives.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tullow Oil, a British oil company, tanked on Monday morning after the company announced the resignation of its CEO and exploration director as well as cutting its production guidance. Tullow’s board also suspended its dividend.
As of Friday’s close, Tullow Oil was worth just under $1.2 billion (£890 million). The stock tanked 60% in the first hour of trading in London, wiping over $700 million (£534 million) from its market cap.
The oil company announced on Monday that its CEO, Paul McDade, and Angus McCoss, exploration director resigned with immediate effect, and the firm will cut production guidance for this year and 2020.
“We are taking decisive action to restore performance, reduce our cost base and deliver sustainable free cash flow,” the company said in a statement announcing the changes.
“A number of factors have been identified that have caused this reduction in production guidance,” including “significantly reduced offtake of gas by the Ghana National Gas Company,” as well as “increased water cut on some wells, and lower facility uptime,” the company said in the statement.
Dorothy Thompson will now move to the executive chair on a temporary basis among as part of other moves at the top of the company.
Thompson added that the board was disappointed with the financial performance of the company and was reviewing operations.
“A full financial and operational update will be provided at Tullow’s Full Year Results on 12 February 2020, with an update on progress to be given in the Group’s Trading Statement on 15 January 2020.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">What we played in December: 'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' and 'FIFA 18'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome back to Engadget's Gaming IRL, a monthly segment where we run down what our editors are playing. This month, we couldn't help but plow through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and devote plenty of time to FIFA 18. And we made some time for classic real-time strategy with Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition.
We'd love to hear what you've been playing, chime in on the comments below!

The notion of Respawn Entertainment diving into the Star Wars universe seemed like a perfect fit. With the excellent (but under-appreciated) Titanfall 2, Respawn proved it could make an engaging shooter campaign in an era obsessed with multiplayer shooters. Star Wars, meanwhile, was ripe for a new single-player experience, especially after the disastrous launch of Battlefront II. So it comes as no surprise that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the best gaming experiences of the year. It could use a bit more polish, but for fans of the franchise, it's still incredibly rewarding.
As we covered in our preview, Fallen Order puts you in the boots of Cal Kestis, a Padawan who's in hiding after the Empire wiped out most of the Jedi. Taking place after the events of Revenge of the Sith, but long before the original Star Wars, the game focuses on one of the darkest periods in the franchise. Cal isn't just a reluctant hero, he's living with the childhood scars of seeing his master and other Jedi brutally murdered in front of him. Before A New Hope, there really doesn't seem to be any hope at all.
But it's not too long before Cal starts to find his way, thanks to the help of another former Jedi, Cere Junda, and their ornery alien pilot, Greez Dritus. It wouldn't be a Star Wars game without notable baddies -- in Fallen Order, the most intriguing one is the Second Sister, a Jedi-hunting Inquisitor for the Empire. While the general thrust of the story might seem familiar, Respawn's writing team manages to explore new territory with these characters. Cal, Cere and even the Second Sister are shackled by lives filled with suffering and regret -- what makes them interesting is how they deal with that.
Fallen Order is clearly inspired by the Souls games -- combat is methodical, and it's very easy to get wiped out by weak enemies if you're not paying attention. Still, this is one area where the game falters a bit. Parrying and dodging attacks isn't nearly as precise as From Software's Sekiro and Bloodborne, which makes the higher difficulties feel unnecessarily punishing. Crowd control gets a bit easier as you acquire more force powers -- I particularly enjoyed pushing loudmouth tough guys to their doom. At its best, Fallen Order manages to make you feel like a light saber-toting Jedi Master, I just wish it did that more consistently.
The game's exploration is baffling as well: your map clearly lays out new paths to follow as you gain new powers. But there's no fast travel, so if you see a new door available on the other end of a planet, you'll have to hoof it there on foot. There are a few shortcuts to make life easier, but it's still no replacement for fast travel. At one point, I found myself deep in the wreckage of a fallen Star Destroyer, and I just quit the game out of frustration to avoid dealing with the trek back to my ship.
It's easy to feel inundated with Star Wars today, with The Rise of the Skywalker coming at the end of the month, and the Mandalorian on Disney+ making Baby Yoda a new viral icon. But Fallen Order is a reminder there are still rewarding ways to explore this universe. And hopefully in a follow up, Respawn will have more time to refine its use of the force.

Irish comedian Dara Ó Briain has a routine that sums up a lot of my frustration with the state of modern video gaming. "You cannot be bad at watching a movie," he says, "but you can be bad at a video game." "And the video game will punish you [for being bad] and deny you access to the rest of the video game," he added. He was talking about his frustration with how Guitar Hero actively thwarts your attempts to play at being a rockstar. Because you need to work through the game's discography, song by song, as if you were paying your dues in the music industry.
It's a pursuit of realism that is both laudable and frustrating if you've little time or patience for the 60-hour grind-a-thons most games have become. Doubly so if you're tasked with grooming or dressing your character as a way of stretching out the entertainment even further. I want games to snip out the dull components of life and just let me get to the exciting, daft bits. That's the point of a video game that exists for our entertainment, as a preferable alternative to real life.
Which brings me around to FIFA 18, a game that sees you handing money to two of the world's most beloved institutions: EA and FIFA. The title was the first FIFA game I'd bought since FIFA 13, which I'd played fairly religiously on my Xbox 360 since it came out -- to the point where the Career Mode team I had lovingly developed since the start were now successful internationals.
Obviously I'd missed the FIFA games coded on EA's Ignite engine, and 18 was built in Frostbite. I knew that there would be some differences in gameplay, but what upset me the most was how entertainment had been sacrificed on the altar of fidelity. It made me not want to play the game, which now seemed designed to actively thwart my dreams of having fun.
Previously when playing Career Mode, you were able to look through a player's statistics and data to see how good a player they were. That meant if you were in the market for someone new, you were able to spend some time looking for someone who fitted in with your playing style. That database was easily searched and quick to rifle through, making it great for when you wanted to get nerdy.
But because in the real world, where there's no guarantee that the player you're going to sign will turn out to be Eden Hazard or Eden Massouema, the spreadsheet is gone in FIFA 18. In its place, there's a process of hiring scouts to look at each player you may decide to look at, which can take weeks, or months. And then it's mostly down to the accuracy and reliability of the scout.
It's a similar situation when it comes to negotiating transfers and contracts with players, now with added theater. Rather than simply offering them a price and a duration, you have to endure a branching, RPG-style cut scene with dramatic music. The player's agent basically insists on whatever they say, and there's no point negotiating with them because they always say no.
In one regard, I get it -- in the real world, players won't simply take a pay cut in exchange for more bonuses, or more playing time. Not that I necessarily want to do that -- but I would like to give all of my first teamers the same flat salary. After all, in my football utopia, that's how it would work, especially at the cash-strapped club I'm currently managing.
"Ah Dan," you may rightly say, "but this is about realism and bringing a true and accurate version of the football world to your home." But were that the case, then surely as soon as I put the disc in, the game would refuse to play, given that I haven't studied for the UEFA A-License. Playing FIFA isn't about the grinding mundanity of football if you don't want it to be, and I don't.
It's also irritating when a player complains about being dropped from a single game, saying they're not getting enough game time. Especially when they've played every minute in a league so far, and I was only resting them for the big cup tie three days later. The game has no sense of internal logic to understand why and how you would rotate players... which is surely more realistic?
And then there's the UI, which is far too busy, overcomplicated and badly laid out compared to its five-year predecessor. Why is player contracts, a seemingly crucial part of the game, buried in the squad hub rather than in transfers? Why do you have to shortlist a player and then go back out of search and into transfers to make an approach, rather than doing it there?
Why, rather than an easily-navigable squad selection, does everything involve so much extra scrolling? Player selection in FIFA 13 was so much better and easier than it is now, and I'm baffled that EA thinks this is somehow better.
Of course I'm still playing it, if only because of the better graphical fidelity and the fact FIFA 13 isn't available on the PS4. But I'm still gonna grouse about it.

In between all the high-profile releases this fall, you may have missed the fact Microsoft released Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, a part remaster, part remake of one of the best real-time strategy games ever made. Recreating a masterpiece is fraught with all sorts of downsides, and it's especially tricky with a game like Age of Empires II that has so much history behind it.
Definitive Edition is technically the game's second re-release. Back in 2013, Forgotten Empires, one of the studios involved in Definitive Edition, updated the game and its excellent Age of Conquerors expansion with high-definition graphics, releasing the package as Age of Empires II: HD Edition. It was a serviceable if uninspired update to a classic. In the intervening years, however, Forgotten Empires continued to work on the game, creating new expansions that add additional playable civilizations and single-player campaigns.
And so Definitive Edition feels like the work of a group of people who have spent the better part of a decade devoted to a game they love, and it shows. The beauty of this re-release is that it stays true to what made Age of Empires II great in the first place, while adding a new level polish. Take the game's presentation, for example. By standards of most modern games, a lot of what Age of Empires II offers on that front is modest. For example, the briefings that play before each campaign mission are a simple affair, with just some drawings and a lone voice to guide you through to the next scenario. And yet they do an excellent job of setting the stage and establishing the stakes.
Forgotten Empires didn't try to reinvent the wheel here; instead, the team gave the briefings (and everything else, for that matter) a fresh coat of paint. The sum total of all these enhancements is that Definitive Edition feels both just as good and better than you remember it, and that is a rare feat for a remaster to achieve.

It was a serviceable if uninspired update to a classic. In the intervening years, however, Forgotten Empires continued to work on the game, creating new expansions that add additional playable civilizations and single-player campaigns.
And so Definitive Edition feels like the work of a group of people who have spent the better part of a decade devoted to a game they love, and it shows. The beauty of this re-release is that it stays true to what made Age of Empires II great in the first place, while adding a new level polish. Take the game's presentation, for example. By standards of most modern games, a lot of what Age of Empires II offers on that front is modest. For example, the briefings that play before each campaign mission are a simple affair, with just some drawings and a lone voice to guide you through to the next scenario. And yet they do an excellent job of setting the stage and establishing the stakes.
Forgotten Empires didn't try to reinvent the wheel here; instead, the team gave the briefings (and everything else, for that matter) a fresh coat of paint. The sum total of all these enhancements is that Definitive Edition feels both just as good and better than you remember it, and that is a rare feat for a remaster to achieve.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tories hold 10-point lead over Labour three days before election</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Conservatives have held onto their significant 10-point lead over Labour with just three days to go until Britain heads to the polls.
As the campaign enters its final few days Boris Johnson is attempting to sway voters in Labour strongholds while Jeremy Corbyn targets swing seats he hopes to take from the Tories.
But while they continue to battle it out around the country, the latest poll tracker shows Labour have tightened the gap – but suggest they won’t have done enough to deny Mr Johnson the majority he wants.
According to PA’s poll of polls, the Conservatives enter the final week of campaigning up at 43%, with Labour 10 points behind at 33%.
The Liberal Democrats are down again on 12% with leader Jo Swinson admitting it ‘doesn’t look likely’ her party will win a majority.
She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s only in the circumstances of a Liberal Democrat majority government which of course in itself would be democratic.
‘But where we are right now that obviously doesn’t look likely.’
She added: ‘The most likely way we can stop Brexit is through a people’s vote and the Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote for three-and-a-half years.’
The Brexit Party remain on 4% after a bruising week for Nigel Farage, whose own MEPs quit to pledge allegiance to the Tories.
And the Green Party is polling at 3% after encouraging tactical voting by teaming up with the Lib Dems.
The poll is based on an average of polling over the last week.
Mr Johnson has said in an open letter today that Thursday’s vote is ‘historic’ and a choice to ‘move forwards’ after Brexit.
Mr Corbyn said it was a ‘chance to vote for hope’ and he had ‘the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades’.
Later today, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will announce the Labour Party’s plan for its first 100 days should it win the general election – vowing to end austerity for good.
Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ‘the very future of Scotland’ is at stake in the election.
She is appealing to voters to back her party ‘to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands’.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snapchat working on 'deepfake' feature which is not as sinister as it sounds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat is working on a ‘deepfake’ feature which will let users add their face to videos.
The new tool is called Cameo and will allow people to replace faces in clips with their own beautiful visage.
A deepfake video uses artificial intelligence to map the likeness of one person onto another.
It’s feared that the technology will be used to destabilise society because it allows the creation of highly convincing fake news.
But there are good reasons not to fear the arrival of Cameo.
It’s being tested in France right now and is likely to be rolled out across the world in the coming weeks or months.
In a statement, Snapchat said: ‘Cameos aren’t ready to take the stage yet, but stay tuned for their global debut soon.’
Deepfake is a portmanteau combining the words ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’, referring to simulated videos of human beings.
Its power has been vividly showcased in footage which shows the
The tech uses machine learning or artificial intelligence to combine digital images with audio files to make convincing-looking fake footage of people uttering words they’ve actually said.
We’ve already it used to bring the Mona Lisa spring to life, whilst pornographers are already creating deepfake sex videos which make it look like mainstream stars are getting involved in the action.
Politics is likely to be profoundly affected by the technology, which was demonstrated recently in a video which appeared to show Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other. 
It’s easy to see how it could be used to make effective propaganda or sew distrust among citizens, who may become unable to work out if a video is fake or genuine.
Snapchat’s own deepfake offering is not as sinister at it sounds for one simple reason: it’s not all that convincing yet.
It will superimpose your face onto a video, sure, but the resulting creation is not particularly realistic.
This means the feature is more suitable for comedy or the creation of bespoke reaction gifs than, you know, subverting democracy.
Snapchat has created 150 looping video gifs for Cameo. You’ll be able to cut out an image of a face and then add it to an actor’s own features in one of these clips.
You’ll also be able to easily send Cameos in chats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman opens shop selling black dolls as a way to cope with grief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sanda Monero started making dolls as a form of therapy, during a time she was struggling.
After being inspired by the woman in her life, Sandra made black dolls with different shades and hairstyles.
What started as a hobby grew and grew and last year Sandra, from Stoke Newington, decided to open her own store called Monero Kids Boutique in Balls Pond Road.
As well as her ‘gratitude dolls’, Sandra, who has also worked in social care, also sells eco-friendly children’s clothing and educational books.
Sandra takes inspiration from her St Lucian heritage and upbringing in London and uses Caribbean and African fabrics such as Kente cloth in her work.
Currently, she has a range of dolls clothing in production with one for every Caribbean island.
Of course, there are thousands of islands, which would take forever to create so Sandra is sticking to approximately 26 dolls.
Her idea started when she lost her parents and her brother – something she still finds difficult to talk about – but she says that having the focus of creating doll clothes has helped to bring her happiness back.
She hopes to introduce two male dolls – one to represent her father and one for her older brother.
‘It is very important as [these dolls] represents little girls and boys’ Sandra told Metro.co.uk.
‘Growing up, I only knew about Barbie and Sindy and of course, I wanted to be like them.
‘But being a black child it was impossible as it did not represent me at all. I am so lucky, now, I am in a position to be able to share and showcase dolls for boys and girls that represent their colour tone.’
There are three main dolls in the Monero Doll collection –  Honey, Ellie and Harley D.
One of the dolls, Ellie, is named after Sandra’s mum who she describes as a ‘beautiful, graceful woman’.
She adds: ‘Honey, is named after a friend of mine called Yinka who has supported and helped me through my challenges.
‘Harley D is named after the Harley Davidson motorcycle as I have a passion for bikes. In addition, her character is partly built around myself and the daughter I would have had.’
She recalls one of her favourite memories in at the Boutique when a little white girl called Hannah came in.
‘She came in and bought the darkest doll,’ said Sandra. ‘When asked why she had chosen that one she said: “Mummy, she looks like my best friend Yemi”.’
If you want to visit Sandra’s store, you can find it in Dalston Junction at 26a Balls Pond Road, London N1 4AU.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Huge fight breaks out at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Horrified onlookers were pushed back by huge crowds of people as a savage punch-up erupted last night at Winter Wonderland in London’s Hyde Park.
Screams could be heard in the background as the two men rapidly traded blows, with one getting his opponent in a headlock.
But others appeared to revel in the violence, as a video shared on social media shows a man jumping up and down with excitement.
Someone shouts as someone else shouts ‘Don’t punch the head’ as people circle around the pair to watch the fight.
Footage then shows security guards in high-vis vests forming a human chain in an attempt to break up the brawl.
The Metropolitan Police say three people were arrested for public order offences at the popular Christmas attraction yesterday but it is not known if they involved in the fight.
People on social media condemned the ‘thuggish-low life behaviour’ and said the venue had become ‘unsafe for children’.
It is thought the brawl broke out as people queued to get into the main beer hall of Winter Wonderland’s Bavarian Village.
An onlooker said massive crowd had gathered outside as the hall had been shut for an hour and was just re-opening.
They told MailOnline: ‘Security were saying it would take two hours to get in and people started getting agitated and pushing to get to the top.
‘Then two men started fighting and throwing punches and everyone was getting pushed back but there was nowhere to go.
‘Security had to move back a barrier to stop people getting trampled, it was quite scary and it’s really lucky nobody was hurt.’
The witness said they saw security guards forming a human chain to stop people rushing into the beet hall amidst the chaos.
They said they saw one of the men bleeding from the fight and the other being arrested later on.
Despite efforts to split everyone up, the witness said violence erupted again as people began flooding into the beer hall.
The onlooker said a cover version singer was pulled off stage and replaced by Bavarian band playing ‘sedate folk music’ in an attempt to keep people calm.
‘At least a dozen’ people were reportedly thrown out by security and bar staff decided to stop selling alcohol.
A Hyde Park Winter Wonderland spokesperson said: ‘We can confirm Police and security staff ejected a number of people following incidents at Hyde Park Winter Wonderland last night. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cardi B denies snubbing meet-and-greet in Ghana to eat kebab</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cardi B hit the clubs in Ghana with T.I. this weekend, just as she was forced to hit back at claims she ‘snubbed’ a meet-and-greet to lounge by the pool eating a kebab.
The I Like It rapper flew out to Nigeria last week to begin her tour of West Africa before making the short trip over to Ghana for more events.
After touching down on her private jet, Cardi received a warm welcome at the airport in Accra where a large horde of fans and photographers were waiting to catch a glimpse of the rap superstar.
Cardi, 27, then settled into her luxurious hotel suite, which included a large bathroom with his and her sinks and a standalone bathtub, large corridors, several rooms and a stunning view with the ocean in the distance.
Hours later, Cardi then hit the club for her scheduled appearance at Livespot x Festival where T.I. and his wife Tiny just happened to be.
In an Instagram video, Cardi is seen dancing the VIP section as T.I. sips his drink while cuddling Tiny.
‘@tip and @tiny makin some big money moves out here!’ Cardi captioned the clip.
It came after Cardi was forced to defend herself after it was claimed she had snubbed a meet-and-greet earlier in the day.
The Bodak Yellow rapper shared an Instagram story of herself sitting by the hotel pool and eating a kebab, which is called Chinchinga in Ghana, at the same time the meet-and-greet was taking place.
However, Cardi argues she wasn’t aware the event was in her contract and she wasn’t told about it.
In an Instagram video, the Grammy-winning rapper explained: ‘First things first, I asked my booking agent “do I have a meet and greet today?” So a meet-and-greet wasn’t in my contract, right? I didn’t know I had a motherf****n meet and greet today. I know I had one in Nigeria, I was on time for that, I did all of that.
‘I didn’t know I had one today. When I woke up, I went downstairs at around 3pm to soak up some sun in the pool and my stomach started hurting, that was around 3pm, right? [sic].’
Cardi continued: ‘Then I woke up, I see this rage going on on f*****g social media, and everybody’s like yeah you gotta do a meet and greet.
‘I seen there was a lot of my fans there at the meet and greet, so I thought you know what, I don’t give a f**k if it’s not in my contract, I’m going downstairs [sic].’
Many Ghanianian celebrities were also at the meet-and-greet after being invited to meet the Money rapper, and slammed Cardi on social media believing she had snubbed them.
Reacting to their anger, Cardi said: ‘Then I guess a lot of artists were upset because they got invited to the meet and greet and I wasn’t there. For that I apologise but then again that wasn’t my fault because it wasn’t me who did that.
‘Let me tell you what I don’t f*****g like, I saw a bunch of females, they supposed to be artists from here and I didn’t know that [sic].’
She continued: ‘But when I was around the pool at around 3pm, which is the time when the meet and greet was supposed to be going on, I was in the pool and the same girls talking s**t about me, saying I’m this or I’m that, y’all saw me… so if you see me around the pool and I’m chilling, staring at me as if I have a piece of f*****g s**t on my eyes, why don’t you come up to me and say, “Welcome to Ghana”? [sic]’
After flying out of Ghana, Cardi wrote in another Instagram post: ‘I was in Ghana for less than 24 hours. Went thru a lil dilemma but I still had fun [sic].’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jose Mourinho makes approach to sign Marouane Fellaini for Tottenham</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jose Mourinho is attempting to sign Marouane Fellaini for Tottenham, according to reports in Belgium.
Mourinho managed Fellaini during their time together at Manchester United before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided to sell the midfielder earlier this year.
But Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure now reports that Mourinho has made the signing of Fellaini his ‘priority objective’ at Spurs.
The report claims that Mourinho has even contacted Fellaini ahead of a potential move in the January transfer window.
Fellaini is currently playing for Shandong Luneng in the Chinese Super League and the 32-year-old has scored seven goals and provided four assists in 22 league appearances for the club.
Fellaini’s current contract with Shandong runs until December 2021 with an option of an additional year.
But the Chinese Super League season has now ended and Fellaini will not be in action until March.
During their time together at United, Mourinho was a huge advocate of Fellaini’s versatility and even described the Belgian as ‘fundamental’ after a 2-0 win over Burnley last season.
‘Everybody knows Marouane is not Maradona but everyone knows what Marouane is and what he can give,’ Mourinho said last year.
‘In this moment, especially this season and also last season he did many times what strikers couldn’t do which is score goals in important moments.
‘I know him very well and I know the positions he can play, the jobs he can do, this season you saw him as a third central defender against Burnley and you saw him as a striker and as a number eight, which is basically the position where Marouane has more balance and know how but he’s very important in both boxes, in the first third and in the last third.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">You need to watch Netflix's Norwegian rom-com series Home For Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix is a treasure trove for so-bad-it’s-good Christmas movies – shout out to The Princess Switch and the entire A Christmas Prince franchise.
But a new festive series has landed on the streaming platform that actually just falls into the good category.
It’s a Christmas miracle!
Norwegian mini-series Home For Christmas (Hjem til jul) is delighting binge-watchers thanks to its whip-smart humour and clever twist on all the Christmas rom-com tropes.
The six-episode series stars Ida Elise Broch as Johanne, a 30-year-old who is smashing it in her job as a nurse and is surrounded by brilliant friends.
But as it hits December, her family only want to know one thing – when is she going to get a boyfriend?
Johanne is already feeling insecure as the ‘single and childless’ are forced to pick up Christmas Eve shifts, her friends with babies bond over the new level of tiredness that only parents can feel, and she runs into her perfect ex who has gone on to get married and have a kid, but when her mother seats her between her twin nephews at the dinner table, enough is enough.
To shut her family up, Johanne lies and says she has a boyfriend who she will bring along to dinner on Christmas Eve – meaning she has 24 days to find a man.
With the help of her housemate, Johanne gets on the dating apps to find her Christmas bae, but between hooking up with a 19-year-old, entering an escape room with a ‘psychopath’ and injuring her crotch while spinning, it’s not all that easy.
While the whole ‘single at Christmas’ thing has been done, Home For Christmas is a fresh look at the pressures of dating at 30 – think Bridget Jones but with Tinder in Norway – and even mocks its inspiration with a Love Actually inspired moment that goes on to point out everything wrong with the Christmas classic.
And those who have discovered the Norwegian series (which comes with English subtitles) are obsessed:
Home For Christmas only dropped on 5 December, but thanks to the series’ ending, people are already wondering if 2020 will bring a second series of the show.
Please, Santa, we’ll be good!
Home For Christmas is now streaming on Netflix – and if you need more festive Netflix fare, here’s the best Christmassy content available.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">£400 million pounds of unused Oyster card credit could be given to the homeless this Christmas, a London Mayoral candidate says.
Liberal Democrat Siobhan Benita is calling for the capital’s residents to be able to hand in ‘dormant’ cards, so the small amounts of cash left on them can be donated to help rough sleepers.
Transport for London (TfL) estimated at the end of September that it was sitting on £400 million in accounts not used for 12 months.
Now Ms Benita wants current mayor Sadiq Khan to enable Londoners to hand in their unwanted cards to benefit homeless charities.
Ms Benita, who last week spent a night sleeping on the streets to fundraise, is calling for the Mayor and Mike Brown, the Commissioner of TfL, to adopt her scheme over the festive period.
Claiming her ‘#OystersForChristmas campaign’ could ‘raise millions’ for homeless charities, she added: ‘I’m calling on the current Mayor to help us release that money.
‘If Sadiq Khan is serious about helping the thousands of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in London this Christmas, he could act now and do something which would have a real impact on vulnerable people’s lives over the festive period and beyond.’
Ms Benita, who says she would establish a new unit to address homelessness and rough sleeping if she wins next year, continued: ‘It’s shocking that the number of rough sleepers in London has surged to a record high, with around 22 new people now sleeping on the streets for the first time each day.
‘It’s shameful that London accounts for over a quarter of the total number of people sleeping rough in England. After nearly a full term as Mayor, Sadiq Khan’s rough sleeping strategy has clearly failed.’
An estimated two homeless people died every day in England and Wales in 2018, according to a shocking report released by the Office for National Statistics in October.
And earlier this month, another report on the rising homelessness crisis said a child becomes homeless every eight minutes in Britain.
Balbir Chatrik, Director of Policy at Centrepoint – a charity which would benefit from the scheme – said: ‘Instead of gathering dust, unused Oyster cards could help raise money for homeless young Londoners. Centrepoint would put this money to use by providing homeless young people with a safe place to live, while helping them to find a home and a job long-term.
‘Extra funding would allow us to expand our Helpline that young people can call for advice when faced with homelessness: 0808 800 0661.’
TfL’s Chief Technology Officer, Shashi Verma, said: ‘Customers can already donate their old Oyster cards to the Railway Children via charity boxes at Heathrow Airport, Kings Cross and Liverpool St. Over the last decade, this has helped raise more than £218K for the Railway Children, an international children’s charity who work with street children in India, East Africa and the UK.
‘We are currently looking to expand the scheme with boxes at a number of additional sites across our network, as well as see whether there are additional options of allowing customer to donate to the Railway Children charity via Oyster refunds in the future.’
Ms Benita is facing competition from Labour incumbent Mr Khan, Conservative Shaun Bailey, Green leader Sian Berry, independent Rory Stewart and others in the May 7 vote.
Mr Khan’s office was contacted for comment.
This weekend, people across Britain took part in the Big Sleep Out, which saw around 60,000 worldwide participate in an initiative to raise money for homeless charities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NHS promises from all major parties are 'not physically possible'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leading health officials have said promises made by the major parties on the NHS are misleading or impossible.
Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said politicians had ducked the big issues in regard to health and social care.
While Royal College of Physicians president professor Andrew Goddard said manifesto promises on the NHS were not ‘physically possible’ because of a lack of people in training to fulfil them.
They both said they have ‘grave concerns’ over how the major parties have campaigned on the NHS throughout the election campaign.
The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised above-inflation increases to spending on frontline care.
Labour has pledged to boost nurse numbers by 24,000 while the Tories have promised 50,000 nurses, but this would include almost 20,000 who are current staff.
But Mr Hopson said politicians on both sides had failed to offer ‘credible answers’ to the NHS’s toughest challenges and that the funding commitments they had made were disappointing.
He wrote in The Times today: ‘In reality, they go no further than restoring NHS funding growth to what they’ve been in past.
‘But it’s not just about money. Whilst we are pleased that parties are committing to increase staff numbers, it’s still not clear how that will actually happen.
‘The offers from the main parties have varied in scope and ambition, but none has developed a compelling worked-through and credibly funded long-term solution.’
He added there was a ‘worrying mismatch’ between what the major parties were promising and what their pledged funding would actually buy.
Mr Hopson said: ‘Bandying about large-sounding increases, based on five-year aggregate numbers, and saying “all will be well” is raising unrealistic expectations that the NHS will inevitably disappoint.’
Meanwhile Prof Goddard warned patients in hospital should get used to seeing their doctors less as the health service reached ‘crunch point’.
He told The Independent he was frustrated ‘by the proposed policies and promises’ by Labour and the Tories and their ‘relationship to reality and what actually is deliverable’.
The East Midlands gastroenterologist also said all three major parties had failed to address the looming workforce crisis among NHS doctors.
Labour and the Tories had used the NHS as a ‘political football’ he said, adding: ‘It’s really hard. In my life I have voted for all three main political parties.
‘I currently have internal conflicts on which way I will vote, there is no easy choice. None of the parties has thought about the long-term problems facing us.
‘The promises that have been made in the manifestos are not physically possible because we don’t have enough people training to fulfil those promises.
‘We need to think about where we want to be in 15 years’ time and plan for it now.’
He argued that Labour’s proposals to train 5,000 more GPs would result in fewer doctors training in psychiatry or emergency medicine.
The Tories’ plan to have 6,000 more GPs by 2024 was not feasible without ‘flooding’ the trainee system with overseas doctors, Prof Goddard said.
Currently, the NHS pays around £1.5 billion to train around 7,250 doctors a year, but the professor said this needed to double to about 15,000 a year, at a cost in excess of £3 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity's Roman baffled as Lorraine asks saucy question about girlfriend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lorraine Kelly accidentally put her foot in it while grilling I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! star Roman Kemp about his first night with girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury.
The radio DJ came third behind Andy Whyment and Queen of The Jungle Jacqueline Jossa last night in another nail-biting finale which saw more than 11 million viewers vote to crown their champion. Although, no one welcomed him when he left the jungle.
Naturally, everyone wanted to know what Roman did immediately after bursting through the doors of his lavish suite at the Versace Hotel in Brisbane, only Lorraine got slightly flustered when she realised she may have gone too far.
‘Tell me, as soon as you got back to that hotel and you gave Anne-Sophie a hug, what else did you do?’ the host began before jumping off her seat to explain herself.
‘You don’t have to tell me as much! I meant food… and things like that,’ she squirmed.
Yeah Lorraine, come on’ Roman teased, rolling his eyes.
Actually, Roman revealed he just rubbed his hands through the carpet and lived out his dreams with a hot shower.
The 26-year-old also admitted he’s ‘flattered’ by flirtations from Love Island winner Amber Gill, but he’s more than happy with his ‘missus’.
‘I’m flattered but it was an amazing moment when I saw my missus, I missed her so much,’ he stressed.
Following his exit Roman told hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly: ‘I’ve never had more fun… I couldn’t be more grateful.’
He added: ‘It’s a strange place down there, it’s an unnatural thing that forms a family within three weeks.’
Jacqueline is the first I’m A Celebrity winner to snub all interviews following her victory. During her stay in the jungle, it was reported she spoke to husband Dan Osborne in unaired scenes over allegations he cheated on the former EastEnders actress with Love Island’s Gabby Allen.
He was also accused of enjoying a threesome with his Celebrity Big Brother co-stars Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling. He’s denied both reports.
I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! is available to stream on ITV Hub. Lorraine airs weekdays at 8.30am on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chrissy Teigen answers all our questions on celebs and their lavish lifestyles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chrissy Teigen gave us a glimpse into the elite lives of A-list celebrities by revealing their secret perks.
The Lip Sync Battle star took to Twitter to complete a Q&A on everything normal people wanted to know about ‘being a super huge A list celebrity’.
Retweeting a fans question asking whether rich people have a ‘junk drawer where they throw random cords and pens’, the 34-year-old responded: ‘it’s celebrity question asking time! Ask me, your favorite A list celebrity anything you would like to know about being a super huge A list celebrity’.
Chrissy – who is married to John Legend – must have regretted giving fans the opportunity because thousands of questions came flooding in immediately.
One fan asked: ‘Do you pay restaurants $ to let you cut the line? Or do they just do it automatically?’ to which Chrissy replied: ‘I make reservations and don’t give them the option to say no. “Hi it’s Chrissy Teigen and id like to make a reservation for 2 for John legend, do you have any availability?” if you just say “hi can I make a reservation for 2?” they say no. gotta say it all at once’.
Pro-tip, if you want to make a reservation, just pretend you’re a celebrity and hope the waiters never figure out you’re lying.
The next fan asked: ‘How the frick do most celebrities travel on planes? Are you ever just hustling through the airport trying to make it to your gate on time?’
A fair question, indeed, because we’ve all wondered how celebs travel without getting bombarded by fans in gross airport toilets.
The mum-of-two answered: ‘There is a terminal a mile from the airport that you pay membership for. they do the same security privately and take you to the plane in a car. I know. I know.’
How much is this membership, Chrissy? We need to know.
If anyone thinks celebrities get to roam around their 20-bedroom mansions with no disturbance, think again.
One fan asked whether assistants live with Chrissy and she answered: ‘We have a house manager who works at the house all day to handle our lives and day to day business, packages, scheduling for household staff etc’.
Not only that, but their assistants do their grocery shopping as well, so Chrissy and her husband probably never have to worry about running out of milk.
Plus, a personal chef helps them with most of the cooking.
As for bills and spending is handled by their very own business accountant.
Meanwhile, the rest of us barter whether a night out is worth eating instant ramen for the rest of the month.

The Azzurri, who were crowned European champions in 1968, will head for Wembley in Friday, March 27 in the first of four friendlies in the build-up to next summer’s tournament.
An FA statement said: “Italy will visit Wembley Stadium connected by EE to face England on Friday 27 March 2020 (8pm kick-off).
“The fixture will be the first of four tests to help the Three Lions prepare for next summer’s UEFA EURO 2020.
“The occasion will also be designated as ‘The Heads Up International’ in support of The FA’s charitable partnership with HRH The Duke of Cambridge’s Heads Together mental health initiative.”
The Italians have been drawn in the same group as Wales, and Gareth Southgate’s men will face another fellow finalist four days later when Denmark head for Wembley.
They will complete their pre-tournament programme with a trip to Vienna to face Austria at the Ernst Happel Stadion on Tuesday, June 2 before a home clash with Romania at a venue still to be confirmed five days later.
England’s campaign gets under way against Croatia on Sunday, June 14 with the winner of the play-off path featuring Scotland, Israel, Norway and Serbia their next opponents on Friday, June 19 and the Czech Republic waiting in the wings for the final Group D fixture on Tuesday, June 23 with all three games taking place at Wembley.

It will also symbolise how successful the Tories have been at this election in overturning generations of political tradition in Labour’s heartlands.
Only four MPs have represented Great Grimsby since the end of the Second World War, all of them Labour – Kenneth Younger, Tony Crosland, Austin Mitchell and Melanie Onn.
It has been a marginal seat ahead of various elections, including 1964, 1987 and 2015, but on each occasion Labour held on.
Now that might be about to change.
The Conservatives need a swing of 3.7% on December 12 to overturn Ms Onn’s majority of 2,565.
Polls suggest the party might be on course to take the seat with candidate Lia Nici, and by a comfortable margin.
It is an outcome that could be repeated in other constituencies across northern England with decades of Labour history.
Examples include Bishop Auckland (Labour since 1935), Wakefield (1932), Don Valley (1922) and Rother Valley (1918).
All of these seats could turn blue on December 12 if the Conservatives perform strongly.
Boris Johnson visited Great Grimsby on Monday while on the campaign trail.
If his party wins the seat this week, it will vindicate the Tories’ strategy of targeting Leave-backing Labour voters in parts of the country that have not seen Conservative MPs for generations.
Six candidates are standing in Great Grimsby: Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Green, the Brexit Party and an Independent.

CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) — More than a century ago, waves of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Poland and Quebec settled in Chicopee and other western Massachusetts mill towns, helping build churches, rectories and schools to accommodate their faith. Today the priests leading those churches are under siege due to stresses, challenges and sex abuse scandals complicating their lives and those of their fellow priests across the United States.
The Rev. Mark Stelzer is among those trying to persevere. He's a professor at a Roman Catholic college in Chicopee, and its chaplain. He travels frequently to out-of-state events organized by a Catholic addiction-treatment provider, recounting his own recovery from alcoholism.
Last year, his busy schedule got busier. Amid a worsening shortage of priests, the Diocese of Springfield named him administrator of a parish in Holyoke, Chicopee’s northern neighbor, where he lives alone in a mansion-sized rectory while serving as spiritual leader to the 500 families of St. Jerome’s Church.
“I’m at an age where I thought I’d be doing less rather than doing more,” said Stelzer, 62.
Stelzer loves being a priest, yet he's frank about the ever-evolving stresses of his vocation that leave him nostalgic for the priesthood he entered in 1983.
“It was a lot simpler then,” he said. “There’s a real longing, a mourning for the church that was — when there was a greater fraternity among priests, and the church was not facing these scandals that are now emerging every day.”
Stelzer’s concerns echoed those of other priests, and some of their psychological caregivers, who were interviewed by The Associated Press.
Weighing on the entire Catholic clergy in the U.S. is the ripple effect of their church’s long-running crisis arising from sex abuse committed by priests. It’s caused many honorable priests to sense an erosion of public support and to question the leadership of some of their bishops. That dismay is often compounded by increased workloads due to the priest shortage, and increased isolation as multi-priest parishes grow scarce. They see trauma firsthand. Some priests minister in parishes wracked by gun violence; others preside frequently over funerals of drug-overdose victims.
One such victim was a 31-year-old woman whose family was among Stelzer’s closest friends. “This is one of the few times I actually felt my voice quivering,” he said of the funeral service he led last year.
Burnout has been a perennial problem for clergy of many faiths. But Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at California's Santa Clara University who has screened or treated hundreds of Catholic clerics, sees new forms of it as the sex abuse crisis persists and many parishioners lose trust in Catholic leadership.
“You’re just trying to be a good priest and now everyone thinks you’re a sex offender,” he said. “If you walk in a park with your collar on, people think you’re on the lookout for children. ... Some have been spat upon.”
The Springfield diocese, like many across the U.S., has a long history of sex-abuse scandals. In the early 1990s, priest Richard Lavigne was defrocked and several of his victims received cash settlements. In 2004, a grand jury indicted Thomas Dupre on two counts of child molestation soon after he resigned following a 13-year stint as Springfield’s bishop.
Stelzer had hoped the abuse crisis was abating but it resurfaced dramatically over the past two years. Abuse allegations led to former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s ouster from the priesthood and a Pennsylvania grand jury report asserted that about 300 priests had abused at least 1,000 children in the state over seven decades.
“It opened up an old wound, and now we're back to ground zero,” Stelzer said in an interview at the College of Our Lady of the Elms.
The wound is self-inflicted, said Rev. Philip Schmitter, 74, who has served for 50 years in Flint, Michigan. His stance endears him to an African American community where he lived in public housing for three decades to maintain close ties.
“This cover up, this ‘Let's protect the institution’ was just a heinous, utterly unchristian kind of behavior,” he said.

Two miles north of Stelzer’s campus, on a recent Sunday, the Rev. William Tourigny was getting ready for the 4 p.m. Mass — his fourth and last of the day — at Ste. Rose de Lima Church.
When Tourigny, now 66, was ordained in 1980, the Springfield diocese had more than 300 priests serving 136 parishes. Since then, the ranks of priests have shrunk by more than half and nearly 60 of the parishes have closed. For Tourigny, it’s meant many more funerals to handle, including dozens related to drug overdoses and heavy drinking.
Even his own family has been scarred: Tourigny says the 27-year-old daughter of his first cousin was killed in circumstances he describes as fueled by her drug habit.
“But for her addiction, she was a wonderful mother,” Tourigny said.
Tourigny says he’s worked nearly 40 years without a real vacation. For years, he’s had therapy sessions, which he describes as “crucially important,” and he strives to minister compassionately without being engulfed in the emotions of those he consoles.
“I can share their pain but I can’t enter into it,” he said. “I’d be overwhelmed by grief.”
With 2,500 families, many of Polish and French Canadian descent, Tourigny's parish has fared better with membership and finances than several nearby parishes. Yet Tourigny says many Catholics now mistrust the church hierarchy because of the flawed response to the abuse scandals.
“I was ordained at a time when the church was so alive — there was so much optimism,” he said. “Then things began to change quickly. It has changed the way people look at us. The church has lost credibility and it’s hard to get credibility back again.”
Plante, the California psychologist, says even priests deeply devoted to their work are upset.
“A lot are angry at bishops and the institutional church for screwing up — a lot of them feel they’ve been thrown under the bus,” he said. “They’re also concerned that one of these days someone will accuse them of misbehavior, even if they’ve done nothing wrong. They’re asking, 'Did I do something 30 years ago that could be misconstrued, that will come back and haunt me?'”
The Rev. Stephen Fichter, pastor of St. Elizabeth Church in Wyckoff, New Jersey, said he has counseled people who’ve been abused by Catholic clergy and understands the “pain and horror” they experienced. Yet he voiced concerns on behalf of priests with unblemished careers who feel vulnerable to unwarranted suspicions.
“Sometimes a priest is confronted by an anonymous accusation from 30 or 40 years ago, and doesn’t have a chance to defend himself,” Fichter said. “It used to be innocent until proven guilty. Now a lot of priests feel it’s been turned upside down.”

Mark Stelzer proudly identifies himself as an alumnus of Guest House, a residential facility in Michigan that has specialized in addiction treatment for Catholic clergy since 1956. He travels frequently to make presentations on behalf of Guest House, and teaches a course at his Chicopee college titled “Addiction and Recovery.”
By the time he was ordained, Stelzer says, he was consuming alcohol daily. Only after five more years of steady drinking did acquaintances suggest he had a problem, leading to his stay at Guest House.
Guest House’s president, Jeff Henrich, is an experienced drug and alcohol counselor. He says substance abuse among priests is a longstanding problem but has been aggravated by recent developments — including the “residual shame” arising from the sex-abuse scandals and increased isolation as more priests now manage parishes on their own.
Since 1985, according to researchers at Georgetown University, the Catholic population in the U.S. has risen by nearly 20%, but the number of priests has plunged from more than 57,000 to under 37,000.
“There’s fewer of them and more work to do,” Henrich said. “That means you’re far more likely to live alone than ever before — and very few of us were meant to live alone.”
In response, treatment experts urge priests in recovery to find companionship in a support group and to form friendships outside their ministry.
Stelzer agrees that isolation raises the risks of substance abuse.
“We’re lone rangers,” he said. “Substance abuse might go undetected for longer when you’re living alone. A lot of those in treatment now say it was because of isolation, working harder and longer, and not feeling support from leadership.”
The harmful consequences of the priest shortage have come to the attention of the Vatican's ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Christophe Pierre. Addressing U.S. bishops in November, he urged them to be attentive to their priests’ health, spiritual well-being and sense of priestly fraternity.
“Many priests are saying they no longer know one another,” Pierre said. “Others, due to the priest shortage, are forced to live in isolation, managing multiple parishes.”
Stress, burnout, depression and addictions are among the conditions treated at St. Luke Institute, a residential treatment center for Catholic clergy and lay leaders, in Silver Spring, Maryland.
St. Luke’s president, the Rev. David Songy, is a psychologist who has worked extensively with troubled priests. One growing problem, he says, is that new priests are now often assigned their own parish within three years, instead of 10 or more in the past, and may be ill-prepared to oversee finances and personnel as well as pastoral duties.
“Some of the younger people that come to us — they’ve been overwhelmed and weren’t sure how to deal with things,” Songy said.
Other stressful changes relate to ideological differences. Tourigny considers himself a progressive and has welcomed lesbian couples into Ste. Rita. He says many young priests now emerging from seminary are less tolerant of LGBTQ congregants and eager to revive the tradition of celebrating Mass in Latin.
Another change noted by several priests: Some parishioners, rather than showing deference to their pastors, openly challenge them.
“In the past they might have disagreed, but they’d be courteous. Now it’s different,” said Fichter. “They think you are not Republican enough or Democratic enough depending on which end of the political spectrum they occupy. ... They want you to preach what they want to hear, and they will confront you.”
At St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York — just north of New York City — there’s increased emphasis on screening applicants for their ability to handle stress and avoid the burnout that’s now affecting some priests even early in their ministry.
“There’s no doubt these men coming forward are facing what will be a very stressful life,” said the Rev. Thomas Berg, the seminary’s vice rector. “We must be sure they have the skill set or will be able to develop it.”
“On top of that, in some places, you don’t have a sense that their bishop supports them,” added Berg. “In plenty of dioceses, priests are essentially treated as outside contractors — there’s a lack of a genuinely caring relationship.”
___
Police officers, firefighters and paramedics are collectively labeled first responders. Henrich, the Guest House president, says priests also merit that label.
“They see trauma and loss on a very regular basis,” he said. “They get called out to hospitals, deal with grieving families, with lost and dead children.”
Gun violence is the plague besetting the Rev. Mike Pfleger’s parish in an African American area of Chicago.
"It's a war zone,” says Pfleger, an outspoken pastor at Saint Sabina Church since 1981. “Doing funerals of children is the hardest for me.”
The violence has ripple effects: He says parents of slain young people go through divorce, mental breakdowns, addiction.
“It becomes overwhelming when it’s day in and day out, and you don’t have the resources to meet the needs,” he said.
Now 70, Pfleger says his health is good, and his work rewarding. Yet he says he and his colleagues risk being overwhelmed by the crises facing their neighborhood of Auburn Gresham.
“I was seeing myself becoming depressed, after several violent deaths in a short span,” he said. “I needed to make sure I talked to somebody.
“Last year I didn’t take any days off — I realized that was a big mistake,” he added. “It’s important to have people around you to say, ‘Are you OK?’”
In Brunswick, Ohio, a town of 34,000 people 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland, the Rev. Robert Stec’s priorities have been transformed, due to the scourge of opioids, since he became pastor of St. Ambrose Church in 2005.
In 2016, Brunswick’s Medina County reported 20 opioid-related deaths. Stec presided over six funerals of those victims in a short span. While sharing parishioners’ grief, Stec resolved to combat the opioid epidemic and founded a multifaith coalition of northeast Ohio religious leaders.
Stec is grateful that Brunswick has better-than-average mental health services. But he and his fellow priests in drug-ravaged towns still employ a triage policy, seeking help for the most dire cases, because they can’t provide comprehensive support to every affected parishioner.
“We weren’t trained for this in the seminary,” he said.
Still the priests treasure their jobs despite the challenges. Mark Stelzer holds onto his role as a comforter. “For a lot of people, I’m the last person they saw while they were still alive,” he said. “There's an energy and grace in those moments.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) - More than a century ago, waves of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Poland and Quebec settled in Chicopee and other western Massachusetts mill towns, helping build churches, rectories and schools to accommodate their faith.

One such victim was a 31-year-old woman whose family was among Stelzer's closest friends. "This is one of the few times I actually felt my voice quivering," he said of the funeral service he led last year.
Burnout has been a perennial problem for clergy of many faiths. But Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at California's Santa Clara University who has screened or treated hundreds of Catholic clerics, sees new forms of it as the sex abuse crisis persists and many parishioners lose trust in Catholic leadership.
"You're just trying to be a good priest and now everyone thinks you're a sex offender," he said. "If you walk in a park with your collar on, people think you're on the lookout for children. ... Some have been spat upon."
The Springfield diocese, like many across the U.S., has a long history of sex-abuse scandals. In the early 1990s, priest Richard Lavigne was defrocked and several of his victims received cash settlements. In 2004, a grand jury indicted Thomas Dupre on two counts of child molestation soon after he resigned following a 13-year stint as Springfield's bishop.
Stelzer had hoped the abuse crisis was abating but it resurfaced dramatically over the past two years. Abuse allegations led to former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick's ouster from the priesthood and a Pennsylvania grand jury report asserted that about 300 priests had abused at least 1,000 children in the state over seven decades.
"It opened up an old wound and now we're back to ground zero," Stelzer said in an interview at the College of Our Lady of the Elms.
The wound is self-inflicted, said Rev. Philip Schmitter, 74, who has served for 50 years in Flint, Michigan. His stance endears him to an African American community where he lived in public housing for three decades to maintain close ties.
"This cover up, this ‘Let's protect the institution' was just a heinous, utterly unchristian kind of behavior," he said.
---
Two miles north of Stelzer's campus, on a recent Sunday, the Rev. William Tourigny was getting ready for the 4 p.m. Mass - his fourth and last of the day - at Ste. Rose de Lima Church.
When Tourigny, now 66, was ordained in 1980, the Springfield diocese had more than 300 priests serving 136 parishes. Since then, the ranks of priests have shrunk by more than half and nearly 60 of the parishes have closed. For Tourigny, it's meant many more funerals to handle, including dozens related to drug overdoses and heavy drinking.
Even his own family has been scarred: Tourigny says the 27-year-old daughter of his first cousin was killed in circumstances he describes as fueled by her drug habit.
"But for her addiction, she was a wonderful mother," Tourigny said.
Tourigny says he's worked nearly 40 years without a real vacation. For years, he's had therapy sessions, which he describes as "crucially important," and he strives to minister compassionately without being engulfed in the emotions of those he consoles.
"I can share their pain but I can't enter into it," he said. "I'd be overwhelmed by grief."
With 2,500 families, many of Polish and French Canadian descent, Tourigny's parish has fared better with membership and finances than several nearby parishes. Yet Tourigny says many Catholics now mistrust the church hierarchy because of the flawed response to the abuse scandals.
"I was ordained at a time when the church was so alive - there was so much optimism," he said. "Then things began to change quickly. It has changed the way people look at us. The church has lost credibility and it's hard to get credibility back again."
Plante, the California psychologist, says even priests deeply devoted to their work are upset.
"A lot are angry at bishops and the institutional church for screwing up - a lot of them feel they've been thrown under the bus," he said. "They're also concerned that one of these days someone will accuse them of misbehavior, even if they've done nothing wrong. They're asking, 'Did I do something 30 years ago that could be misconstrued, that will come back and haunt me?'"
The Rev. Stephen Fichter, pastor of St. Elizabeth Church in Wyckoff, New Jersey, said he has counseled people who've been abused by Catholic clergy and understands the "pain and horror" they experienced. Yet he voiced concerns on behalf of priests with unblemished careers who feel vulnerable to unwarranted suspicions.
"Sometimes a priest is confronted by an anonymous accusation from 30 or 40 years ago, and doesn't have a chance to defend himself," Fichter said. "It used to be innocent until proven guilty. Now a lot of priests feel it's been turned upside down."

Mark Stelzer proudly identifies himself as an alumnus of Guest House, a residential facility in Michigan that has specialized in addiction treatment for Catholic clergy since 1956. He travels frequently to make presentations on behalf of Guest House, and teaches a course at his Chicopee college titled "Addiction and Recovery."
By the time he was ordained, Stelzer says, he was consuming alcohol daily. Only after five more years of steady drinking did acquaintances suggest he had a problem, leading to his stay at Guest House.
Guest House's president, Jeff Henrich, is an experienced drug and alcohol counselor. He says substance abuse among priests is a longstanding problem but has been aggravated by recent developments - including the "residual shame" arising from the sex-abuse scandals and increased isolation as more priests now manage parishes on their own.
Since 1985, according to researchers at Georgetown University, the Catholic population in the U.S. has risen by nearly 20%, but the number of priests has plunged from more than 57,000 to under 37,000.
"There's fewer of them and more work to do," Henrich said. "That means you're far more likely to live alone than ever before - and very few of us were meant to live alone."
In response, treatment experts urge priests in recovery to find companionship in a support group and to form friendships outside their ministry.
Stelzer agrees that isolation raises the risks of substance abuse.
"We're lone rangers," he said. "Substance abuse might go undetected for longer when you're living alone. A lot of those in treatment now say it was because of isolation, working harder and longer, and not feeling support from leadership."
The harmful consequences of the priest shortage have come to the attention of the Vatican's ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Christophe Pierre. Addressing U.S. bishops in November, he urged them to be attentive to their priests' health, spiritual well-being and sense of priestly fraternity.
"Many priests are saying they no longer know one another," Pierre said. "Others, due to the priest shortage, are forced to live in isolation, managing multiple parishes."
Stress, burnout, depression and addictions are among the conditions treated at St. Luke Institute, a residential treatment center for Catholic clergy and lay leaders, in Silver Spring, Maryland.
St. Luke's president, the Rev. David Songy, is a psychologist who has worked extensively with troubled priests. One growing problem, he says, is that new priests are now often assigned their own parish within three years, instead of 10 or more in the past, and may be ill-prepared to oversee finances and personnel as well as pastoral duties.
"Some of the younger people that come to us - they've been overwhelmed and weren't sure how to deal with things," Songy said. Stress, burnout, depression and addictions are among the conditions treated at St. Luke Institute, a residential treatment center for Catholic clergy and lay leaders, in Silver Spring, Maryland.
Other stressful changes relate to ideological differences. Tourigny considers himself a progressive and has welcomed lesbian couples into Ste. Rita. He says many young priests now emerging from seminary are less tolerant of LGBTQ congregants and eager to revive the tradition of celebrating Mass in Latin.
Another change noted by several priests: Some parishioners, rather than showing deference to their pastors, openly challenge them.
"In the past they might have disagreed, but they'd be courteous. Now it's different," said Fichter. "They think you are not Republican enough or Democratic enough depending on which end of the political spectrum they occupy. ... They want you to preach what they want to hear, and they will confront you."
At St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York - just north of New York City - there's increased emphasis on screening applicants for their ability to handle stress and avoid the burnout that's now affecting some priests even early in their ministry.
"There's no doubt these men coming forward are facing what will be a very stressful life," said the Rev. Thomas Berg, the seminary's vice rector. "We must be sure they have the skill set or will be able to develop it."
"On top of that, in some places, you don't have a sense that their bishop supports them," added Berg. "In plenty of dioceses, priests are essentially treated as outside contractors - there's a lack of a genuinely caring relationship."

Police officers, firefighters and paramedics are collectively labeled first responders. Henrich, the Guest House president, says priests also merit that label.
"They see trauma and loss on a very regular basis," he said. "They get called out to hospitals, deal with grieving families, with lost and dead children."
Gun violence is the plague besetting the Rev. Mike Pfleger's parish in an African American area of Chicago.
"It's a war zone," says Pfleger, an outspoken pastor at Saint Sabina Church since 1981. "Doing funerals of children is the hardest for me."
The violence has ripple effects: he says parents of slain young people go through divorce, mental breakdowns, addiction.
"It becomes overwhelming when it's day in and day out, and you don't have the resources to meet the needs," he said.
Now 70, Pfleger says his health is good, and his work rewarding. Yet he says he and his colleagues risk being overwhelmed by the crises facing their neighborhood of Auburn Gresham.
"I was seeing myself becoming depressed, after several violent deaths in a short span," he said. "I needed to make sure I talked to somebody.
"Last year I didn't take any days off - I realized that was a big mistake," he added. "It's important to have people around you to say, ‘Are you OK?'"
In Brunswick, Ohio, a town of 34,000 people 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland, the Rev. Robert Stec's priorities have been transformed, due to the scourge of opioids, since he became pastor of St. Ambrose Church in 2005.
In 2016, Brunswick's Medina County reported 20 opioid-related deaths. Stec presided over six funerals of those victims in a short span. While sharing parishioners' grief, Stec resolved to combat the opioid epidemic and founded a multifaith coalition of Northeast Ohio religious leaders.
Stec is grateful that Brunswick has better-than-average mental health services. But he and his fellow priests in drug-ravaged towns still employ a triage policy, seeking help for the most dire cases, because they can't provide comprehensive support to every affected parishioner.
"We weren't trained for this in the seminary," he said.
Still the priests treasure their jobs despite the challenges. Mark Stelzer holds onto his role as a comforter. "For a lot of people, I'm the last person they saw while they were still alive," he said. "There's an energy and grace in those moments."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VIJAYAWADA: Veteran opener Wasim Jaffer achieved another first-class milestone on Monday as he made his 150th appearance in Ranji Trophy. Featuring for Vidarbha, Jaffer is playing his 150th Ranji game against Andhra at the Devineni Venkata Ramana Praneetha Ground.
Jaffer is followed by Devendra Bundela and and Amol Muzumdar, who have 145 appearances and 136 appearances in the Ranji Trophy.
Jaffer has 40 tons to his name in his Ranji career and has amassed 11775 runs. The Mumbai-born batsman has played a total of 253 first-class matches, scoring 19,147 runs, averaging 51.19.
He has represented India in 31 Tests and 2 ODIs.
Jaffer's 150th Ranji match's start was, however, delayed after a snake entered the Dr. Gokaraju Liala Gangaaraju ACA Cricket Ground on Monday morning.
Vidarbha skipper Faiz Fazal won the toss and opted to field first against Andhra. Soon, the players made their way into the middle and just when play was about to start, the reptile entered the playing arena and play was halted.
The official Twitter handle of BCCI Domestic posted a 13-second video in which the snake can be seen slithering around in the field even as the players watched on with puzzled faces.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Payday firms offer loans @ 500%</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: They are banned in 15 states in the US, China has capped the interest they can charge and consumer groups in European countries are fighting to get them banned. But in India, payday loans are flourishing unchecked, with more than a dozen lenders having started operations in the past two years.
A payday loan is an ultra short-term borrowing meant to help the individual tide over a temporary crunch. Think of it as a personal loan for 7-30 days which has to be paid in full along with interest when you get your next salary. An estimated Rs 400 crore is disbursed by payday loan companies every month.
However, these loans are prohibitively costly, charging an interest between 1% and 1.5% per day. On an annualised basis, this works out to 365-540%. Credit cards, which charge 2-3% per month for rollover (or 24-36% per annum) appear cheap in comparison.
The upside is that payday loan companies don’t mind sullied credit histories or low credit scores. In fact, it helps them charge high rates. Payday borrowers are typically subprime customers who desperately need cash but have exhausted all other options including the credit cards.
Minimum paperwork required
Payday loans require minimum documentation and are disbursed quickly. A borrower just has to upload a few documents (Aadhaar, PAN card, latest salary slip and 3-month bank statement) and hand over a post-dated cheque of the amount payable at the end of the tenure. The post-dated cheque is the security the lender needs. If it bounces, the issuer can be prosecuted under the Negotiable Instruments Act.
According to Consumer Finance Protection Bureau of the US government, over 80% of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days. One out of two borrowers end up taking at least 10 more loans before they are debt-free. In many cases, the borrower only digs himself a bigger hole. This is why payday loans have been banned in most US states and are under the scanner in other countries. In China, the maximum interest that can be charged on payday loans is 36%.
The high interest rate is not the only cost for the borrower. There is also a processing fee that can be as high as 7% of the loan amount. If the cheque bounces or you want to extend the repayment date, you are slapped with penal charges of Rs 500-1,000.
Payday loan or advance?
Not all lenders charge a bomb. Earlysalary CEO and co-founder Akshay Mehrotra draws a distinction between his company and payday lenders. “Our objective is to help the borrower manage his cash flow by giving him a loan he can repay in three monthly instalments.”
Earlysalary gives loans of up to 50% of the salary and charges 2-2.5% per month. the company disburses loans worth ₹150 crore every month.
Some payday loan companies warn the borrowers upfront about the high interest rates. Loanwalle charges 1% per day on the loan, but discourages repeat borrowers by hiking to rate by 1 bps everytime a borrower comes back for more. “One should take these loans only for emergencies. An emergency can’t come up every month. If you take these loans repeatedly, very soon you’ll go bust,” says Abhijit Banerjee, director of Loanwalle.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Team-bonding activities have been in vogue ever since Rahul Dravid started mentoring India's junior teams and continuing the tradition, the World Cup-bound under-19 squad is spending a couple of days at the Kabini Forest Safari at the Nagarhole National Park as part of that exercise.
BCCI GM (Cricket Operations) Saba Karim and National Cricket Academy COO Tufan Ghosh said that the entire exercise has been designed in consultation with NCA director Rahul Dravid, who mentors the India A and Under-19 squads.
"It's a two-day team bonding exercise and not a boot camp or anything. If I remember, earlier an India A team had also gone to the Nagarhole National Park. We keep having these activities for U-19 and A teams. This is not for the senior team though which has its own schedule," Karim said on Monday.
The Nagarhole National Park is in the Mysore district of Karnataka.
COO Ghosh then explained that the BCCI has engaged with a company which organises these team-bonding activities, including 'Tiger Safari'.
"The boys in the India U-19 team come from various parts of the country. This kind of team bonding exercise helps them build relationships, grow trust which is required in team environment. Also certain activities are designed which can test how they react to different situations," Ghosh said.
"The boys enjoyed a Tiger Safari today. In fact, I am told, that they spotted a couple of tigers at various points. A company which designs these kind of programmes consulted the coaches as well as (NCA head) Mr Dravid to formulate a set of activities," he said.
Asked if the players will have boot-camp like activities, which are physically strenuous, Ghosh answered in the negative.
"Boot camp has an army connotation but this is not like a boot camp."
It must be recalled that when Dravid was the chief coach, the U-19 batch of 2016 which featured the likes of Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kishan had a trekking session as a team-bonding exercise.
The under-19 World Cup will be held January next year in South Africa.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vistara signs codeshare agreement with Lufthansa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Vistara has entered into a codeshare pact with German airline Lufthansa, the sixth such agreement with an international airline as the domestic full service carrier seeks to expand its overseas network.
As part of the agreement, Lufthansa will add its 'LH' designator code to nearly 18 Vistara-operated flights every day covering ten Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.
The two carriers already have an interline partnership. Vistara is the second airline after Air India to have a codeshare agreement with Lufthansa.
In a release on Monday, Vistara said the two airlines are planning to soon expand scope of the agreement, enabling frequent fliers of both airlines to earn miles/ points when travelling on each other's networks and enjoy other benefits.
Codesharing allows an airline to book its passengers on its partner carriers and provide seamless travel to destinations where it has no presence. An interline arrangement refers to a pact to issue and accept tickets for flights that are operated by the partner airline.
Apart from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the codeshare agreement with Lufthansa will cover Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Goa, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Kochi and Pune.
"Sales under the codeshare agreement progressively open today on all channels and major GDS systems for flights starting December 16, 2019," the release said.
Vinod Kannan, Vistara's Chief Strategy Officer, said as a growing global carrier, one of its key goals is to offer an extended international network to customers through such strategic associations.
Vistara and Lufthansa already have an interline/ Through Check-in agreement, using which customers can seamlessly connect from Vistara-operated domestic flights in India to Lufthansa-operated flights to both of its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich and beyond.
Using the Through Check-in facility, customers get their boarding passes at the first point of departure for all the travel sectors, both domestic and international, with their baggage checked through to the final destination, as per the release.
Vistara, which began services in January 2015, now has codeshare agreements with six airlines -- Lufthansa, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, United Airlines and Japan Airlines.
It also has around 27 interline partnerships with various airlines.
Lufthansa said it has entered into a "comprehensive codeshare agreement" Vistara.
"As part of the new agreement customers benefit from 126 weekly flights connecting ten key Indian cities to the Lufthansa Group network via Delhi / Lufthansa and Vistara in final stages on enabling customers being able to earn miles flying with both airlines," the German carrier said in a release.
This would be in addition to Lufthansa's current schedule of 56 weekly international flights to and from the major Indian hubs of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.
"It is planned to subsequently add more destinations of Vistara's network under the umbrella of the codeshare agreement in 2020 and beyond," the release said.
Vistara operates over 200 flights daily connecting 34 destinations. It has a fleet of 27 Airbus 320 and 9 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. The carrier is a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines.
Lufthansa Group airlines serve 270 destinations in 105 countries on four continents, offering 11,000 weekly frequencies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Once propped up by Qatari high-rollers, Saudi city prays for truce</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Al-Ahsa (Saudi Arabia) (AFP) - Jackhammers and cranes gather dust at half-built Qatari-funded hotel sites in a Saudi city hit hard by an abrupt diplomatic rupture, but signs of thawing cross-border ties are reviving economic hopes.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has downplayed the dispute with Qatar -- which led to a Riyadh-led embargo on the neighbouring emirate and shuttered their land border in mid-2017 -- as a trivial matter with limited impact on the kingdom.
But it is anything but trivial for Al-Ahsa, a desert oasis near the border where Qatari shoppers once kept the local economy humming, crossing over to buy relatively cheaper provisions -- from herbs and eggs to milk and camel meat.
The deep-pocketed residents of gas-rich Qatar -- one of the wealthiest countries per capita -- also pumped millions of riyals into local hotels, date plantations and other real estate.
But the Qatari money dried up when the embargo shut them out, unleashing economic pain and dividing extended families on both sides, an unintended consequence of a policy meant to hurt Doha's government.
The Saudi-led bloc accuses Qatar of backing radical Islamists including Muslim Brotherhood and seeking closer ties with Riyadh's arch nemesis Iran -- charges Doha denies.
"The blockade had a negative impact on towns near the border and complicated investments at a time when Saudi Arabia's economy is struggling with large deficits," said Samuel Ramani, a doctoral researcher at Oxford University.
Official statistics are hard to come by but the tell-tale signs of the economic impact are everywhere in Al-Ahsa, home to more than a million people.
Its malls and traditional souks are emptier, multiple gas stations leading up to the border have shuttered, and even salesmen of bisht, traditional gold-trimmed robes, complain of depressed sales.
Shells of three Qatari-funded luxury hotels lie abandoned after construction was halted abruptly in 2017, a long-term investment some believe was intended to accommodate any surplus guests of Qatar's 2022 football World Cup.
The manager of another Al-Ahsa hotel pointed at his vacant parking lot, once full of cars with Qatari plates. The hotel's occupancy rate tanked after the embargo, and it has barely managed to cover its electricity bill, he told AFP.
But the fact that the majority of Qatari investors have not liquidated their investments in Al-Ahsa despite the embargo gives some hope it will be business as usual if relations are restored.
- Hopeful signs -
The feud is not irreconcilable, residents say, describing it as a spat between squabbling cousins. And amid signs of a thaw, many are betting on the return of Qatari high-rollers.
"The rift is between governments, not the people," said an Al-Ahsa businessman who asked not to be named.
"We are not different countries, we are one big family."
Arab diplomats say both sides are closer than ever to bringing the dispute to an end.
Raising hopes is recent "sports diplomacy", which saw football teams from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain travel to Qatar for the Gulf Cup despite earlier indications that they would boycott the tournament.
State-funded media networks on all sides recently appear to have toned down the shrill rhetoric against each other.
Qatar's foreign minister, who travelled to Saudi Arabia last month for talks, has spoken of "some progress" in negotiations.
But the real bellwether will be the level of Qatari representation at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in Riyadh on Tuesday. The Saudi king has personally invited Qatar's emir, but it remains unclear whether he will attend.
Two sources familiar with the negotiations, including an Arab diplomat, told AFP that hardliners in Abu Dhabi -- Riyadh's principal ally -- are opposed to a restoration of ties.
This has raised the prospect of a "bifurcated peace", implying Qatar could possibly normalise ties with only some blockading nations including Saudi Arabia, with whom it shares its only land border.
- 'Punishment' -
Saudi Arabia appears to be adopting a de-escalatory approach after a series of what observers describe as foreign policy "missteps" that have spooked investors.
A cool reception by global investors to state energy giant Aramco's stock sale has highlighted the downside of its aggressive stance, they say.
Ramani said the rapprochement appears to be shaping up "without major concessions from Doha", after the blockade boosted its self-reliance.
Once heavily dependent on food imports, it has developed new trade routes, flown in thousands of dairy cows and developed poultry farms to beat the embargo.
"Qatar is like a newborn baby kicked out of a house as punishment," the Arab diplomat -- who is from outside the Gulf -- told AFP.
"You thought it would come back crying to you, but it has stood on its feet and does not need you anymore."

    <h5 class="mb-1">McLaren reveals track-focused 620R</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">High-performance machine is limited to just 350 units
McLaren has announced a road-legal version of its GT4 race car – the 620R.
Limited to just 350 units – all of which will be hand-assembled at the firm’s factory in Woking – the 620R shares much of its componentry with McLaren’s track car.
Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 610bhp and 620Nm of torque, the 620R takes the title as the most powerful car in McLaren’s Sports Series.
It’ll crack 0 to 60mph in just 2.7seconds and hit a top speed of 200mph, sending its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed DCT gearbox. Thanks to features such an adjustable carbon fibre rear wing, the 620R can generate up to 185kg of downforce.
The 620R also benefits from the race car version’s adjustable coilover dampers, with 32 individual settings available per corner. Its cornering performance is bolstered further thanks to stiffer anti-roll bars, carbon-ceramic brakes and ultra-sticky Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tyres.
Inside, the air conditioning has been removed, while the carpets and glove box have been removed in the quest for lightness. That said, the audio system and navigation – removed as standard – can be put back in at no extra cost.
Both driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fibre bucket seats with six-point harnesses, while the shift paddles, steering wheel spokes and centre console have all been crafted from the ultra-light material.
As mentioned, the 620R is limited to just 350 units, with each one commanding a £250,000 price tag. European and American buyers get a McLaren track day, featuring expert tuition, included as part of the car’s price, too. Production is set to commence in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I’m A Celebrity….Get Me Out Of Here crowns 2019 winner</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The final was a battle of the soap stars.
Jacqueline Jossa has won I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here after defeating Andy Whyment.
The final became a battle of the soap stars after the former EastEnders actress trumped the Coronation Street actor and radio DJ Roman Kemp came third.
After she was named queen of the jungle, she said: “I have no words.”
Before she won, she told hosts Ant & Dec: “It was not what I expected.
“It was a lot harder. I didn’t think it would be such a turning point in life, I went in as one person, I feel like I have come out as a different person.
“I’ve grown in confidence and found who I am as a person.”
She added: “I think it’s so easy to care so much what other people think of you, trolls, people who say nasty things for the sake of it and I try to change their opinion.
“Here you have no choice, you have to be you. Here I have different people bigging me up of different ages, I can’t really work out what is happening.
“I’ve always been known as Lauren from EastEnders, or a doormat, or whatever you want to call it, and coming here I have actually proved myself.”
While she was in the jungle, she hit the headlines after campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly told her that her husband Dan Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.
Former The Only Way Is Essex star Osborne and Allen were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.
It was reported that Jossa threatened to quit the show and was allowed by bosses to leave Osborne a voice message about Stephenson’s claims.
Osborne flew to Australia with their children to be there when she left the show, and after she left the jungle she was seen embracing Osborne before they posed for photographs.
Earlier in the episode, all three contestants took part in a final bushtucker trial.
Jossa faced the Stake Out, where she had to lie on a giant star on the floor with her legs and arms tied down as different insects were left to crawl over her body.
These included mealworms, crickets, scorpions and cockroaches, before she had to hold a spider in her mouth for the final minute.
After she finished, she joked to Ant and Dec: “You’re out of order.”
By successfully completing the trial, she scored starters for everyone, a drink and a surprise treat.
Whyment had to take part in the bushtucker bonanza, where he was given the choice between classic bushtucker dishes and more appetising options, but the tastier plates came at the expense of a star.
He chose witchetty grub over a prawn cocktail, a camel’s hoof over a roast chicken dinner, a whole scorpion over a sticky toffee pudding with custard, a pig’s testicle over a Bacardi and diet coke and a crocodile anus over a plate of chocolate biscuits.
After securing main courses for everyone, as well as as drink a treat, he said: “I’m so glad I’ve done it and got five stars.
“It’s been an amazing experiences and I still can’t believe I’m here, I’m a super fan so to get to the final I’m really chuffed. Come on guys give us a cuddle.”
Kemp was tasked with facing the panic pit, where he was strapped into an underground chamber and snakes crawled over his body.
As the lights went out, he said he could feel the tongues of the snakes on his skin and admitted it was “absolutely terrifying”.
His success scored him a pudding for everyone in camp, as well as a drink and a treat.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A snake on the outfield delayed the start of a cricket match in India.
The new season of the Ranji Trophy, a domestic first-class competition, was getting under way around the country on Monday but the match between Andhra and Vidarbha in Vijayawada was held up for an unusual reason.
Footage posted on Twitter by the BCCI showed the players waiting around as a snake slithered through the outfield before play had got under way.
Vidarbha, who won the toss, were in the field and their players could be seen attempting to shoo the intruder off the surface.
When the snake eventually left, defending champions Vidarbha took up where they left off last season, reducing the hosts to 163 for six at tea.
The snake was not the first unwanted intruder to hold up a cricket match this year – in June a World Cup match between Sri Lanka and South Africa in Durham was halted because of a swarm of bees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Industry-backed campaign encourages gamers to vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the UK general election just four days away, a new campaign has been launched to encourage gamers to vote.
Founded by video game presenter and voice actor Elle Osili-Wood, the Gamechangers Giveaway has received support from across the industry.
AAA studios like Bethesda, Activision, and Ubisoft are joined by indie developers like Frontier, Spilt Milk Studios, and Raw Fury, along with PR agencies Indigo Pearl, Dead Good Media, and Renaissance PR, plus EGX and Insert Coin Clothing.
The Gamechangers Giveaway includes over two hundred video game prizes, which voters can win by tweeting a picture of themselves outside their polling station, using the Twitter hashtag #GamechangersGiveaway.
One winner will take home over 20 games, tickets to EGX Rezzed, £50 voucher for Insert Coin, a Dungeons & Dragons kit, and a range of game merchandise.
"It's never been more important to vote -- it's time to step up and be a gamechanger," said Osili-Wood. "With 85% of UK adults under 35 regularly playing video games, gamers are a significant demographic in the upcoming election, so I'm thrilled to see the games industry come together to get out the vote."
After nearly a decade of austerity and the Brexit still hanging in the balance, this year's general election -- called just two years after former prime minster Theresa May's disastrous attempt to secure a landslide majority -- has been described as the most important vote in a generation.
Since the 1997 general election, voter turnout in the UK hasn't risen above 70%. However, since falling to 59% in 2001, the figures have been steadily increasing. In 2017, voter turnout was at its highest in nearly 20 years.
The Gamechangers Giveaway will go live on Thursday, when polls open, and can be found by on Osili-Wood's Twitter, or by following the Twitter hashtag #GamechangersGiveaway.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Several injured, about 100 people in the area as New Zealand's White Island volcano erupts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WELLINGTON: About 100 people were near New Zealand's White Island volcano when it erupted suddenly on Monday (Dec 9), leaving authorities scrambling to treat the injured and find those unaccounted for.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the volcanic island - also known as Whakaari - off New Zealand's north coast had erupted while groups of tourists were visiting.
"It is very much an evolving situation and of course all our thoughts are with those affected," she told reporters in Wellington, adding that an undetermined number of people were unaccounted for.
Authorities said the eruption began about 2.30pm local time (9.30am Singapore time), throwing smoke and debris into the air.
The island is about 50km from North Island in the picturesque Bay of Plenty, and is popular with adventurous tourists willing to don hard hats and gas masks.
The White Island volcano is one of New Zealand's most active volcanoes.
According to the national Met Service, the eruption was visible on satellite images. 
Whakatane mayor Judy Turner said "there have been people injured" and rescue missions were under way.
"I don't know how many or the state of their injuries but emergency services are currently frantically trying to get these people back from the island to hospital for treatment," she said.
She added that there seems to be no danger for the people in the coastal areas, farther from the volcano.
St John Ambulance said there were up to 20 people believed injured but medical teams were still en route.
There were particular fears for a group of visitors seen walking on the crater floor moments before the eruption occurred.
Cameras providing a live feed from the volcano showed more than half a dozen people walking inside the rim at 2.10pm local time (9.10am Singapore time), before images went dark when the eruption occurred minutes later.
Police said they were responding to the incident, but offered no further comment.
A report by the NZ Herald said many of those visiting White Island on Monday were from the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.
Port of Tauranga company chief executive Mark Cairns was quoted as saying that he understood the majority of those injured in the eruption are from the ship. 
New Zealand's national emergency crisis centre has been activated.
The volcanic eruption made the area immediately around the island hazardous, the National Emergency Management Agency said in an emailed statement.
The agency described the eruption as "moderate", although a thick plume of white ash could be seen for miles around.
Several helicopters and aircraft could be seen in the area.
White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano cone and about 70 per cent of it is undersea, according to government agency GeoNet.
Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.
In August of that year the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Volcano Erupts in New Zealand, Tourists are Missing (VIDEO)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of tourists were near New Zealand's island when a volcano erupted there, the Associated Press reported, citing country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Some people have been injured and others are still missing.
The volcano began erupting at 2.30pm local time on Monday. White Island is located about 50 km off the North Shore's eastern coast and is often frequented by tourists.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there were "a number" of tourists on or around the island, both from New Zealand and overseas.
"I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who have loved ones at the island at that time - and I can assure them police are doing everything they can," she said.
According to her, there seems to be no danger to people in coastal areas distant from the volcano.
Smoke from the eruption is also visible from the continental part, and the National Emergency Response Agency has warned that some areas may be affected by the burning ash.
According to local media, there were many people around and on the island. 
The island's volcano is one of the most active in New Zealand. Twelve people died on the island in 1914, when sulfur was obtained from it. Part of the volcano's crater has collapsed and the collapse has destroyed the mining village and the mine itself.
The White Island is also known as  Whakaari.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trouble brews in post-election Sri Lanka</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two weeks after the election of hardliner Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka, the prospects for justice and reconciliation between the different communities on the island lie in tatters. The victory of Gota, as he is commonly known, sent shockwaves across the Tamil-dominated northeast - where memories of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa's brutal presidency, marked by mass atrocities and enforced disappearances, remain fresh. 
Gota, who served as defence secretary between 2005 and 2015, stands accused of war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war (1983-2009).
The Tamil community were hoping for a victory of Sajith Premadasa, the deputy leader of the United National Party (UNP), who was seen by Tamils as the "lesser evil". While Premadasa also adopted nationalist rhetoric during his campaign, vowing to protect military chief Shavendra Silva from war crimes accusations and pledging to give prominence to Buddhism, minorities were terrified at the prospect of a return to the brutal authoritarianism of the Rajapaksas.
Tamils and Tamil-speaking Muslims went to the polls in large numbers, with the vast majority of the northeastern vote going to Premadasa. But it was not enough for his victory. His opponent, Gota,swept the Sinhala south, winning the election with a whopping majority.
After the vote, members of the Sinhalese majority levelled accusations of disloyalty and separatism against Tamils - once again exposing the deep fault lines running between the two major ethnic groups on the island.
The faint hopes for justice and reconciliation during the term of Gota's predecessor, Maithripala Sirisena, encouraged by over-enthusiastic Western governments and a Colombo-based elite, disconnected from ground realities and preoccupied with promoting superficial processes, are now gone. Sri Lanka is slipping back into chauvinistic politics which threatens to destabilise the country.
The new president wasted no time reaffirming his "strongman" credentials, immediately rallying his Sinhala Buddhist base after the election.
In his inaugural speech on November 18, he pledged to lead the government based on "Buddhist philosophy" and to support the Sinhalese culture and Buddhist heritage and highlighted his role in the civil war.
The inauguration ceremony was held at a Buddhist temple in the northern city of Anuradhapura built by Sinhala ruler Dutugamunu, who defeated the Tamil Chola King Ellalan and united the entire island under Sinhala rule. 
Gota also moved against those he saw as a threat to his government. He imposed a travel ban on police officers involved in investigations of alleged crimes perpetrated by his family after one of them fled the country to Switzerland after the election. Following his escape, an employee of the Swiss visa section was detained and questioned, a worrying development which could endanger the work of foreign embassies on the island.
Tamil and Sinhala media have also faced increasing pressure since the vote. Several journalists were forced to hand their computers to the police over unsubstantiated accusations of spreading hate speech. Tamil activists have ramped up their security protocols and some are reconsidering their continued presence in the country. Self-censorship has become the norm once again.
Meanwhile, hate speech, particularly against Tamils, has exploded on social media, with no action taken against those posting. In the centre of the country, Tamils were attacked by Sinhalese, who accused them of voting against Gota.
It is quite clear that under the new president, Sri Lanka will continue to embrace the persistent chauvinism that has dominated its political scene since independence from Britain in 1948.
The main idea behind it is that Sri Lanka is a Sinhala Buddhist country and those of different faith or ethnicity migrated from elsewhere and are not part of the native population of the island. Today, the Sri Lankan constitution gives Sinhala Buddhism primacy, guaranteeing it the "foremost place" and entrusting the state with protecting and fostering it. State institutions, the military and the economy are also dominated by a Sinhala supremacist ethos. 
Meanwhile, those perceived as "outsiders" - Tamils, Tamil-speaking Muslims, Christians and others - are expected to submit to Sinhala Buddhist primacy on the island and relent to being treated as subordinate. Any resistance to their inferior status is seen as a threat to Sinhala Buddhist supremacy in Sri Lanka and viciously attacked by the majority.
It was against this chauvinism of the Sinhalese majority that the Tamils rose in rebellion in the 20th century. The long-running war for Tamil self-rule culminated in the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009. A yet unknown number of Tamil civilians died in the final months of the war. The United Nations says there could have been more than 70,000 deaths during this time, while some activists say the figure is closer to 140,000.
Calls for justice for repeated atrocities committed against Tamils by the state have fallen on deaf ears. Nevertheless, families of the forcefully disappeared during the conflict continue to raise their voices, defying a state that denies that crimes were committed against the Tamil community.
Gota's victory is seen as a major setback by Tamils, but has not discouraged them. Ten days after his inauguration, Tamils turned out in droves to commemorate Maaveerar Naal, the Tamil National Remembrance Day, in moving ceremonies at multiple locations across the northeast.
This, despite harassment by local authorities, arrests of a number of individuals involved in preparations for the commemoration and fears of a crackdown. Every main Tamil newspaper on the island covered the day on their front pages, sometimes with emotional tributes. 
In Kilinochchi, the former administrative capital of the Tamil Eelam administration, thousands took part in a ceremony, laying flowers and lighting torches at a burial ground for LTTE fighters destroyed by the army. Amid tears and wailing by those mourning the dead, songs were played promising the establishment of Tamil Eelam, as the crowd sang along. The defiance was palpable.
As I joined families filing past the fragments of headstones, one man, whose sister was an LTTE fighter, killed in the fighting, told me, "We will not forget and our children won't forget. For as long as we exist as a people, the struggle for freedom from oppression will continue." Ten years after the end of the LTTE, the resistance to the state continues to define the politics of Tamils.
When Sirisena of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015, Sri Lanka was prematurely hailed as a success story, as the United States and the European Union swiftly re-engaged with the government, restarting trade and military cooperation, which had suffered severely under the first Rajapaksa reign.
While the then-government made a plethora of pledges to enact political reforms and establish an accountability mechanism, it failed to act on them. The enthusiastic coddling of Sri Lanka by the international community post-2015 undermined the urgency for progress, by removing the pressure brought about by international criticism, which had made Sri Lanka commit to those pledges in the first place.
The openness of the last five years under the internationally supported but shaky UNP-SLFP government is seen by many Tamils as an abnormality. Repression has been the norm in Sri Lanka and Gota's victory is a return to that norm. 
The events of November once again revealed the fundamental problem of the country and its nation-building project. The Sri Lankan political system has failed to give minority communities proper representation, while the state continues to promote an exclusionary national identity.
Gota has reiterated that he will not focus on political grievances, instead putting his efforts into the development of Tamil regions. This will not appease the Tamils. Without a fundamental rethinking of the Sri Lankan state, national identity and the foremost place given to Sinhala Buddhism, the conflict that has plagued this island since independence will continue to fester.
While there is no appetite among Tamils for a renewed war, the unfettered Sinhala Buddhist nationalist agenda touted by Gota, expected to include renewed efforts to change the demographic makeup of the northeast, will fuel ethnic conflict and division. 
As this government has made it abundantly clear that it will not initiate the necessary reforms to accommodate minorities, the international community must condition its engagement with Sri Lanka on progress on justice and political devolution. Without these political changes, Sri Lanka will remain a failed nation and a divided island.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Citizenship bill not even .001 per cent against minorities,' says Amit Shah</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday introduced contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in Lok Sabha and said that it is not even .001 per cent against minorities in the country.
"This Bill is not even .001 per cent against minorities in the country," Shah said in the House, amid much uproar by the opposition.
 
Shah said that Muslims from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't get the benefit of this amendment as they have not faced religious persecution.
"If any Muslim from these three (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh) nations applies for citizenship according to our law, then we will consider it, but the person won't get the benefit of this amendment as the person has not faced religious persecution," said Shah in the Lower House.
"In Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains have been discriminated against. So, this bill will give these persecuted people citizenship. Also, the allegation that this Bill will take away the rights of Muslims is wrong," he said.
"Why do we need this Bill today? After independence, if the Congress had not done the partition on the basis of religion, then today we would have not needed this Bill," he said.
The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019 seeks to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.
Through this bill, Indian citizenship will be provided to the members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from the three countries to India till December 31, 2014, to put an end to them being treated as illegal immigrants in the country.
It is important to note that the Bill was passed by the Lower House of the Parliament earlier this year but lapsed with the term of the previous Lok Sabha during the first term of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government in the Centre.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu protests against onion price hike</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amaravati: Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP president, N Chandrababu Naidu, on Monday staged a protest against the sharp increase in onion prices.
Naidu and his party colleagues wore onion garlands around their necks and protested at the fire station near the state secretariat in Venkatapalem village here.
 
The TDP leaders also carried a big onion model while a weighing scale, with gold on one side and onions on the other, was also seen at the protest to suggest that the vegetable has become a precious commodity with the skyrocketing prices.
"Onion prices have risen to the level of gold prices and the state government has failed to reduce the price. Our fight will continue until the prices of onion come down," Naidu said.
Raising slogans against the Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government, Naidu marched towards the state assembly where they were stopped by the police when they tried to enter inside the premises.
This action by the police led to a verbal altercation between them and TDP leaders.
On Sunday, people queued in West Godavari district to buy onions at subsidised rates at a Rythu bazaar (farmers market).
The price of onions has been on the rise in many states over the past week, which has even sparked protests among the people.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BS Yediyurappa celebrates with son as trends show BJP leading in K'taka by-polls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bengaluru: With the trends indicating a victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 12 seats, the mood is upbeat in the BJP camp with party workers and leaders celebrating at the state office.
Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa celebrated the early leads with his son BY Vijayendra who sought his father's blessings and greeted him with sweets.
 
The BJP candidates are leading from the Athani, Kagwad, Gokak, Yellapur, Hirekerur, Ranibennur, Vijayanagara, Chikkaballapur, K.R.Pura, Yeshvanthapura, Krishnarajapete and the Mahalakshmi Layout seats.
Two Congress candidates, on the other hand, are leading on the Hunasuru and Shivajinagar constituencies while an independent candidate, Sharath Kumar Bachegowda is also leading from the Hosakote seat in the initial phases of the counting.
K Gopalaiah, the BJP candidate from the Mahalakshmi Layout has the biggest margin of 32 thousand votes against Congress' M Shivaraja.
On the other hand, Congress' HP Manjunath is also leading by a margin of 33 thousand votes against BJP's H Vishwanath from the Hunasuru seat.
The result will not just decide the fate of BJP government in the state but also of those thirteen rebel MLAs who had sought the re-election following their resignation from erstwhile Congress-JD(S) coalition.
Earlier Yediyurappa had confidently said that BJP will win at least 13 seats and the government will be "safeguarded".
The elections were held for 15 Assembly seats which were left vacant after the legislators resigned in July, triggering the collapse of the Congress-JDS coalition and paving the way for the BJP to come to power.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google’s first “Pixel feature drop” includes post-snap Portrait Mode, auto Call Screen, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this month, Google rolled out the December Android security patches. The company made some changes to the format they have traditionally used for these monthly releases. Instead of listing “functional patches” on the Pixel Bulletin, Google moved them to the Pixel Community Forum. Today, the company announced another change to how Pixel devices will receive updates with the first-ever “Pixel feature drop.”
Google describes Pixel feature drops as follows:
This inaugural feature drop includes a couple of great features. First, we’ll start with Google Photos. Portrait Mode is a great feature in the Google Camera app, but it does require you to proactively switch modes before snapping a photo. You will now be able to retroactively turn on Portrait Mode on Pixel devices with Google Photos.
Next up is automatic Call Screen on Pixel devices, which is something we discovered in an APK teardown. Google Assistant can automatically screen unknown callers and filter detected robocalls before your phone rings. If the call was not a robocall, your phone will ring a few moments later and show context about who is calling and why. You can find transcripts of these calls in the Dialer app. Google mentions that this is an update to Call Screen specifically on the Pixel 4.
There are a few other odds and ends included in the feature drop. Google Duo gets smoother video calls on poor connections thanks to sound prediction with machine learning and the 90Hz display on the Pixel 4 helps reduce choppiness. Duo also has a new Portrait Mode-esque filter. Memory management has been “enhanced” across all Pixel devices so you can run more apps at the same time. Google also highlighted the features that users discovered in the last security update.
So that’s it for the first Pixel feature drop. This is essentially a rebranded and much more consumer-facing approach to the “functional patches” found in security updates. Google can elaborate on the features much more and make sure users know what’s new.

Text description provided by the architects. 111 East Grand is the first multi-story office building in North America to employ dowel laminated timber (DLT), a mass timber system relying on a friction-fit bond between softwood dimensional lumber and hardwood dowels. The 65,000-sf building occupies a high-visibility 265’ x 65’ urban site.
Retail spaces activate the street level with three floors of office space above. Spruce glulam beams and columns frame the 40’-0” x 6’-8” DLT panels that serve as floor and roof decks. The system facilitated a quick erection time and a smaller site crew, minimizing disturbance to the neighborhood during construction. A precast concrete service core buttresses the south of the building functionally and structurally.
The wood construction’s refined aesthetics enable the structure to remain exposed as an interior finish. This minimizes tenant improvement work and the potential for chemically impregnated finishes while providing visual, tactile, and olfactive stimulation to its occupants. Operable windows within each structural bay allow natural ventilation. Balconies on the west take advantage of downtown views. Natural Accoya wood soffits and columns complement the exposed wood interior. Black Zalmag panel rain screen clad the east, north, and west elevations.
St. Kilda Surf & Turf, a polished-casual dining establishment located on the ground level, anchors the building’s northwest corner. The restaurant’s north and west walls are fully glazed, expanding the dining experience out to the penumbra of the overhanging office floors above. The electrical conduit has been tamed to fit between the exposed structural wood panels. Edison bulbs suspended from multi-colored pendants round out the holistic, soft-industrial aesthetic.
Variously configured dining areas gravitate to a full-service bar sheltered under a volume of slatted wood and diaphanous steel. Preparation activity has been located front and center, showcasing artisanal performance with a comfortable informality. Adjustable illumination sets the assembly aglow, allowing the restaurant to strike different moods throughout the evening. 111 East Grand is innovative in both design and project delivery.
The core design team of architects, civil engineers, and structural engineers collaborated closely with the mass timber engineers and general contractors from the onset. This relationship enabled the project to push the boundaries and convey the unconventional appeal of a sensible material.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US raked in a record $7.2 billion in tariffs in October, new data shows</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US government collected a record amount in tariffs in October as a trade dispute between the Trump administration and China escalated, according to new data released Monday.
Revenue from import taxes jumped to $7.2 billion that month, the free-trade advocacy groups Tariffs Hurt the Heartland and The Trade Partnership said. That was the most in history and a $1 billion rise from the same time a year earlier.
President Donald Trump slapped steep duties on an additional $111 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1, hitting far more consumer products than in previous tranches. He is scheduled to further escalate tariffs this Sunday as the two sides struggle to hammer out the details of an interim trade agreement.
"Even when faced with this staggering number, it's still unclear whether the president will follow through with his threat to raise taxes yet again," said Jonathan Gold, a representative for Americans for Free Trade. "This trade war has lasted long enough and done enough damage."
While the White House has often asserted that foreign exporters pay tariffs, there's evidence that those costs largely fall on domestic business and consumers. Roughly $42 billion in additional tariffs were paid from February 2018 to October 2019, according to the data.
Trade-dependent sectors like manufacturing have been hit particularly hard by the trade dispute. The free-trade groups said that seven swing states — Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — had paid an additional $7.66 billion in import tariffs over the past year and a half.
China has retaliated against the Trump administration with tariffs of its own on American imports, particularly on politically sensitive agricultural goods. Chinese tariffs on US exports have totaled $12 billion since the start of the trade war, the free-trade groups said, and topped $1.3 billion in October.
Trump has sought to placate farmers through a more than $28 billion bailout program. The Department of Agriculture has projected that for 2019 more than a third of farm income will come from government subsidies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netflix dominates Golden Globes nominations while Apple lands its first</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has announced the nominees for the 2020 Golden Globes, and this could be a milestone year for streaming. Netflix is even more of a frontrunner among streaming services than it was last year, with 17 TV network nominations and a flood of nods for movies like Marriage Story (six), The Irishman (five) and The Two Popes (four). In some cases, it's even the dominant force -- in both the best picture and best supporting actor categories, three out of five nominees are Netflix projects.
This is also a defining moment for Apple TV+, which is scoring its first Golden Globe nominations just weeks after its debut and mere hours after it got its first nomination for any award. The Morning Show received a best TV series drama nomination as well as two best TV actress nominations for its leads Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. While this won't give Netflix reason to panic, it's evident that Apple's big investments are paying off.
Amazon and Hulu also fared well with five TV network nominations apiece for titles like Fleabag, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Catch-22.
The flurry of nominations won't guarantee victory when the awards ceremony takes place on January 5th, 2020. It does suggest that streaming productions will take home at least some awards, though. And remember, the Golden Globes outcome is frequently considered a predictor for the Oscars. It's entirely possible that you'll see movies like Marriage Story and The Irishman receive more critical acclaim.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls and center your Duo videos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To keep its phones from steadily getting worse over time, Google plans to roll out bigger updates, called feature drops, to its Pixel devices. The first feature drop, rolling out this month, will bring the latest Call Screen features and improved Duo video calls to the Pixel 4. And even if you have a slightly older Pixel, the feature drop will let you add Portrait Blur to photos you've already taken.
The Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls using Call Screen. The feature will silently filter out junk calls. If it's not spam, you'll get a description of who's calling and why, so you can decide whether you want to answer. Because Call Screen works on the device, it won't use Wi-Fi or data.
Google is making a few changes to Duo calls, too. On the Pixel 4, Duo will keep you centered in the video frame as you chat. If another person joins you, the frame will automatically adjust to fit them in. If the connection is spotty, a machine learning model on the Pixel 4 will fill in the gaps, guessing which sound was cut out and filling it in, and to reduce video choppiness, Smooth Display will refresh up to 90 times per second.
Pixel 2, 3 and 4 models will also get a portrait filter in Duo, which will blur the background slightly to make you look sharper. You'll be able to apply a similar filter to photos, too. Whether you just took the picture or snapped it years ago, Pixel owners can now add the Portrait Blur in the Google Photos app.
The features are already rolling out, and they should arrive on Pixel devices in the coming weeks. Google plans to make feature drops a regular occurrence, but we don't know what other changes are in the pipeline.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mellon: Referee 'bottled' Tranmere penalty shouts in Accrington Stanley stalemate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Micky Mellon slammed the performance of referee Tony Harrington in Tranmere’s 1-1 draw with Accrington Stanley on Saturday afternoon, claiming the EFL official ‘bottled’ key decisions in the contest. 
Rovers fell behind in the match when Accrington captain Sean McConville prodded past Scott Davies from close range in the first-half, before Kieron Morris levelled the scoring before half-time.
The Whites were the far superior side after the interval, and were denied what looked to be two very strong appeals for penalty kicks.
Corey Blackett-Taylor was pulled to the ground inside the area by defender Harvey Rodgers shortly after the restart, while Neil Danns had an appeal waved away with the game approaching its climax.
Speaking after the game, Mellon was left perplexed by Harrington’s decision-making as he made a case for the two incidents.
“I don’t get it. I think he has bottled it, to be honest with you,” said the Rovers’ boss.
“I think he has decided that he’s not going to make a decision on the one with Corey. Then, the other one with Danns, he’s about to hit the ball, so why is he going to dive? Common sense would tell me that his next strike is a clear shot on goal.
“Danns was going to turn to shoot; I don’t know why he would dive there. And the same with Corey Blackett-Taylor, why is he going to go down when he’s about to square it across the face of goal?”
It was not only Mellon who voiced his frustrations at the performance of Harrington, however, with Accrington boss John Coleman labelling the lack of fouls awarded in favour of striker Dion Charles as a ‘disgrace’.
Coleman’s complaints came as no surprise to the Tranmere manager, with the pair crossing paths many times in the past.
“Every free-kick that goes against John, he wants it for him. Every one, he contests for himself. I’ve known John a long time, and I don’t think I’ve really come away from any game and John has not complained about what’s happened. That’s just John. I love him to bits, but I could have told you before the game that John would say something like that. It’s just the way it is and that’s the way we are. We want to win games of football, we’re really competitive,” said Mellon.
“We should have had maybe two penalties, does John say that? I bet he has not mentioned that. There were a lot of decisions for the referee to make, a lot of contact and a lot of challenges. I’m not going to complain about that. We should have had two penalties, we haven’t got them, so I can’t cry about that. We have to just all move on.”
Tranmere now face a period of uncertainty, with captain and goalkeeper Scott Davies out with a calf injury.
Luke Pilling was introduced in the 30th minute of play after Davies pulled up with an injury, though Mellon was encouraged with the performance of the 22-year-old shot-stopper.
 “You can’t prepare for that, but young Luke has come on and done terrifically. He made a right good save when they could have made it 2-0—it was a terrific save to keep us in the game. We knew it may hit that tempo fairly early on and, for some reason, we didn’t meet it until we had lost a goal which spiked us into getting going.
He continued: “Luke is really blossoming. He looks a lot more comfortable now. We’ve tried to get him developed as much as possible, with as much game-time as possible. I was pleased with him.
“We think Scott has got a calf problem. He has felt his calf, so we will assess that over the next 24 hours and see if it settles down or not.  For him to come off, it was definitely too much for him to carry on.”
Rovers’ unwanted record of conceding first goals in matches was further extended on Saturday afternoon. Mellon’s side have now been trailing in 15 of their 18 league matches this season, striking first on only three occasions. 
Eager to shake off this habit, though, the Tranmere boss admitted that ‘it’s up to the players’ to now bring about change. 
“I don’t think it’s a regular thing,” expressed Mellon. 
“We speak to the players before games about the asks of each match, but let’s stick to the positives. 
“We understand that we didn’t start the game as well as Accrington, but we came roaring back and finished the game on top. We will speak to them again and will say ‘you need to start games better, your mentality has to be good and you have to meet the asks of the game early on’. It’s up to the players to then deliver on that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Marriage Story' leads Golden Globe nominations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK -- A Netflix wave swept over the 77th Golden Globe nominations, where the streaming company dominated with 34 total nominations, including four films up for best picture and four series nominated for the top television awards.
Noah Baumbach's divorce drama "Marriage Story" led all films with six nominations including best picture, drama, and acting nods for its two leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, in nominations announced Monday by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in Beverly Hills, California. "Marriage Story," which landed on Netflix on Friday after a three-week run in theatres, also earned nods for Baumbach's script, Laura Dern's supporting performance and Randy Newman's score. The only notable category it missed on was Baumbach for best director.
Three other Netflix films landed best picture nods, chief among them Martin Scorsese's mob epic "The Irishman," which landed five nominations including best drama picture, best director for Scorsese and supporting acting nods for Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Surprisingly left out was its lead, Robert De Niro.
Quentin Tarantino's 1960s Los Angeles fable "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," a Sony Pictures release, also scored five nominations, including best film comedy or musical and nods for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Tarantino is also up for best director. In a statement, DiCaprio called it "a love letter to Los Angeles" and "a celebration of cinema."
But the degree to which cinema -- that word that Scorsese has passionately argued over this season -- is changing was overwhelming apparent in Monday's nominations. Just as it is girding for battle with a host of new streaming services, Netflix flexed its muscles across all categories. HBO Max and NBCUniversal's Peacock are set to join the streaming fray next year, on the heels of the launch of Apple TV-Plus and Disney-Plus.
But for now, Hollywood belongs to Netflix. It also scored best picture nods for the Vatican bromance "The Two Popes" in the drama category (along with nominations for its stars, Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins); and the Eddie Murphy-led "Dolemite Is My Name" in the comedy category (along with an acting nod for Murphy).
Before landing four on Monday, Netflix had never earned a Golden Globes best picture nomination.
Two Netflix series tied HBO's "Chernobyl" with the most nominations on the TV side with four nods: "The Crown" and "Unbelievable." Netflix's "The Kominsky Method" and "The Politician" additionally landed best series, comedy or musical, nominations alongside Emmy favourites "Fleabag," from Amazon, and HBO's "Barry."
Led by "Succession," "Big Little Lies" and "Chernobyl," HBO still had a strong showing with 15 nods overall, second to Netflix's 17 television nominations -- even if the final season of "Game of Thrones" failed to make it into the best drama series category.
Montreal filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee's Crazyrose Productions is named in the "Big Little Lies" nomination. He directed the first season of the HBO series but not the second one, however he is an executive producer on the show.
But streaming services made greater inroads to one of Hollywood's premier parties than ever before, reflecting the industry's quickening realignment. Amazon had eight nominations in total, boosted by "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" and "Fleabag." The recently launched Apple TV Plus scored its first Globes nominations with "The Morning Show," including nods for Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Broadcast networks were shut out entirely.
But shed a tear for Baby Yoda. Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian" didn't make the cut.
Yet if the Globes nominations gave a snapshot of the changing media landscape, some saw a notable lack of progress in other areas. The press association again fielded an all-male directing category, nominating Scorsese, Tarantino, Bong Joon Ho ("Parasite"), Sam Mendes (whose World War I thriller "1917" was also nominated for best picture, drama) and Todd Phillips ("Joker").
Among those left out were Greta Gerwig ("Little Women"), Lulu Wang ("The Farewell") and Marielle Heller ("A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"). The Globes have only ever nominated five women for best director. At the 2017 awards, Natalie Portman pointedly introduced the category's "all-male nominees."
None of this year's 10 nominees for best picture were directed by women, either. Most notably overlooked was Gerwig's upcoming Louisa May Alcott adaptation "Little Women," which was nominated for Saoirse Ronan's lead performance and Alexandre Desplat's score. Adding to the trend was the omission, on the TV side, of Ava DuVernay's acclaimed Central Park Five miniseries "When They See Us."
Alma Ha'rel, director of the acclaimed "Honey Boy," writing on Twitter on Monday listed nine female filmmakers whose movies touched audiences, including Lorene Scafaria ("Hustlers") and Melina Matsoukas ("Queen & Slim"). She wrote: "That's our awards. No one can take that away."
In a statement, Ronan emphasized with her director: "My performance in this film belongs to Greta as much as it does to myself and I share the recognition completely with her."
The awards campaign of "Joker" got a lift Monday, also landing nods for best film, drama, and for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. With more than $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales, it's easily the biggest blockbuster to crash the Globes.
A handful of likely best-actress Oscar contenders nabbed a nomination, including Renee Zellweger ("Judy"), Charlize Theron ("Bombshell") and Cynthia Erivo ("Harriet"). Jennifer Lopez ("Hustlers") secured her expected nod for best supporting actress, as did Tom Hanks, for best supporting actor, for his Mister Rogers in "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
It was a good day for crowdpleasers, including Rian Johnson's star-studded whodunit "Knives Out" (best picture, comedy or musical; acting nods for Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas), the Elton John biopic "Rocketman" (best picture, comedy or musical; best actor for Taron Egerton); and the madcap Nazi Germany coming-of-age tale "Jojo Rabbit" (best picture, comedy or musical; best actor for its young star, Roman Griffin Davis). James Mangold's racing drama "Ford v Ferrari," though, could have used a bigger boost from the press association; it landed a sole nomination for Christian Bale.
"There are only two things I let interrupt my beauty sleep: fire alarms and the Golden Globes nominations," said "Jojo Rabbit" writer-director Taika Waititi. "Thank you HFPA for acknowledging that comedy can be a powerful tool against hate and supporting `Jojo Rabbit."'
The nominees for best foreign language film went to "The Farewell," which also earned a best actress earned for Awkwafina; Pedro Almodovar's "Pain and Glory," for which Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor; Bong's "Parasite"; Ladj Ly's French police thriller "Les Miserables"; and Celine Sciamma's period romance "Portrait of a Lady on Fire."
Several possible Academy Awards favourites weren't eligible in the Globes' top categories. Even though the press association is a group of foreign journalists based in Los Angeles, they don't nominate international films for best drama or best comedy/musical. That ruled out Bong's social satire "Parasite" (which the Los Angeles Film Critics Association voted the year's best on Sunday) and Wang's family drama "The Farewell." Both are expected to be in the Oscar mix.
"I was already aware of those regulations and I respect that every awards ceremony, they all have their own traditions, so for me foreign language film is best picture," Bong said by phone. ""Directors like Almodovar and Scorsese, who are nominated for best director, I've studied them since I was young, so just to be among them was an honour, regardless of the category. Because Almodovar is also only nominated for best foreign language film, it makes it an honour for me."
Vying for best animated feature are: "Frozen 2," "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World," "The Lion King," "Missing Link," and "Toy Story 4." The award wasn't necessarily one sought by "The Lion King." Disney has argued that Jon Favreau's remake, made largely with computer generated imagery, is live-action.
Dean DeBlois of Aylmer, Que., wrote and directed "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World," which is the final instalment in the Oscar-nominated animated film trilogy. Montreal-raised actor Jay Baruchel voices the lead character, a young Viking named Hiccup.
The Globes, with 87 voting members, differ wildly from the Academy Awards, which are decided by 9,000 industry professionals. But the press association's choices sometimes line up with the academy's, like last year when "Green Book" (entered as a comedy at the Globes) triumphed at both.
This year could give the Globes slightly more sway because the awards season is especially truncated. The Academy Awards are being held several weeks early, on Feb. 9, giving Oscar campaigns less time to find momentum.
Ricky Gervais will host the Globes, broadcast on NBC, for the fifth time on January 5. In addition to being a supporting acting nominee, Hanks will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award. The Carol Burnett Award will go to Ellen DeGeneres.
One movie that didn't scratch out much love Monday: "Cats." Press association members screened Tom Hooper's upcoming, much-memed adaptation of the Broadway musical but rewarded it with only a nod for the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Taylor Swift song "Beautiful Ghosts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">F-117 Stealth Fighters Are Playing the Enemy (Taking on F-22s, F-15s and F-16s)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Eleven years after the U.S. Air Force officially retired the type, an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter has made yet another public appearance.
Plane-spotter Kris Tanjano was posted up outside the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada on Dec. 3, 2019 when he witnessed an aerial exercise play out overhead. F-117s apparently flying from Tonopah Test Range were in the mix along with F-16s, F-15s, F-22s and possibly B-1 bombers coming from Nellis Air Force Base.
The Lockheed-made stealth fighters apparently were acting as radar-evading adversaries in a mock battle with other plane types, Tanjano told Tyler Rogoway at The War Zone. “I witnessed an F-117 along with four F-16s go up against F-15s and F-22s. The F-117's callsign was KNIGHT, the F-16s were GOMER and MIG, and they were communicating on the aggressor frequency.”
“First, the F-16s came in pairs attacking the blue force (F-22s, F-15s, and maybe a B-1) then an F-117 came in at low-level just behind the F-16s towards the blue force,” Tanjano added. “They all fought it out for about five to 10 minutess then restarted for a second push. Once again the F-16s came high overhead, followed by a low-level F-117. Several times the aggressors called out a target which was a low-level heavy aircraft which I believe was B-1, but I am not certain.”
The sighting seems yet again to confirm what Rogoway long has suspected. “Having a small aggressor force of F-117s available for putting our and our allies' latest radars, infrared search and track and electronic emissions detection system to the test, as well as to develop tactics for defeating such threats, seems like a perfect job for the F-117.”
The first of 59 front-line F-117s became operational in the mid-1980s and most famously led deep strike missions targeting Iraqi forces during the 1991 Gulf War. F-22 stealth fighters in 2008 assumed the F-117s’ strike role pending the 2016 introduction of F-35 stealth fighter-bombers.
The Air Force packed many of the F-117s into a storage hangar at Tonopah. But some of the “retired” Nighthawks continued to fly on secretive missions. Amateur plane-spotters packing powerful cameras photographed and videotaped F-117s flying over the desert test range and taxiing on its remote runway, sometimes singly and sometimes in pairs.
Nighthawks also showed up on the ground. Photographer Chris McGreevy on Aug. 16, 2019 spotted a truck hauling an F-117 on Columbia Way near the Palmdale Regional Airport outside Palmdale, California.
Richard VanderMeulen on Feb. 26, 2019 photographed a single, unmarked F-117A flying over the restricted air space R-2508 range complex near Death Valley in southern California.
The photos, first published in Combat Aircraft, depicted an F-117 with partially worn or obscured markings flying at low altitude around the mountains. The aircraft made another brief appearance the next day.
The February 2019 sighting was notable for taking place outside of the air space around Tonopah Test Range, the F-117’s usual haunt. In a sort of preview of the December 2019 sighting, the Nighthawk appeared in the company of two F-16s.
“The F-16s may very well have been putting a new infrared search-and-track pod to the test or some other sensor system, or maybe they were just all out for a flight through the area to keep up basic competency,” Rogoway wrote. “We just don't know.”
Why would the Air Force want to keep a few Nighthawks operational, despite their age, complexity, high cost and the fact that Serbian air-defense forces figured out how to detect the planes and actually shot one down during the 1999 U.S.-led air war on Serbia?
Rogoway has ideas. “The F-117 is an incredibly valuable and well-understood stealthy target to test new sensor systems against and new low-observable (stealthy) coatings on.”
“On the radar and infrared tracking side of the argument, the F-117 is ... a near-perfect and highly available low-observable aircraft to test everything from ground-based radars and [surface-to-air missile] systems, both foreign and domestic, AWACS modifications, fighter radars and even infrared search-and-track systems.”
But the stealth fighters won’t last forever, Rogoway explained. “The F-117s are slowly disappearing into the abyss. Congress's former mandate to keep the fleet of roughly 52 jets in Type-1000 regenerative storage indefinitely at the high-security Tonopah Test Range Airport has ended.”
The Air Force plans annually to remove four F-117s from storage and dispose of them. At that rate, the remaining Nighthawks could disappear for good some time in the 2020s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China's Plan for 6 Aircraft Carriers Just 'Sank'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">China reportedly is slowing its plan to acquire two aircraft carriers for each of its regional fleets.
Instead of speeding ahead with the development of a six-carrier fleet -- two each for the northern, eastern and southern fleets -- the Chinese navy could stop after acquiring flattop number four.
“Plans for a fifth [carrier] have been put on hold for now, according to military insiders,” the Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported. “They said that technical challenges and high costs had put the brakes on the program.”
The possible pause in carrier-production could cement the yawning capability gap between the U.S. and Chinese fleets.
Song Zhongping, a military expert and T.V. commentator, in late 2018 toldGlobal Times that China needs at least five aircraft carriers to execute its military strategy. Wang Yunfei, a retired Chinese navy officer, said Beijing needs six flattops.
The Chinese defense ministry declined during a November 2018 press conference to specify how many carriers it ultimately planned to acquire.
But leaving aside the high cost, six flattops would have made sense. Equipping each of the three regional fleets with two flattops would have allowed one carrier from each fleet to deploy while the other underwent maintenance.
In 2019, each fleet possesses between 20 and 30 major surface warships, at least a dozen submarines and a handful of amphibious vessels. Just one, the Northern Theater Navy headquartered in Qingdao, operates an aircraft carrier -- Liaoning, China's refurbished, former Ukrainian flattop, which commissioned in 2012.
The second carrier Shandong, a slightly-improved copy of Liaoning and China’s first home-built flattop in late 2019 is completing sea trials. Carrier number three, a bigger vessel than Liaoning and Shandong, is under construction in Shanghai. Flattop four presumably would be similar in design to number three.
Liaoning and Shandong both displace around 55,000 tons of water. Their powerplants are non-nuclear and, for launching planes, they feature ramps rather than American-style catapults.
The ramp layout probably limits aircraft to a maximum launch weight of 30 tons, a former Chinese navy source revealed. At that weight, a J-15 carrier fighter cannot carry a full load of fuel and weapons, limiting them to brief fights over short distances.
The third and fourth carriers reportedly will have catapults, allowing them to launch heavier planes including fully-armed fighters and radar-early-warning planes. Beijing’s long-term ambition to develop nuclear-powered flattops are on hold, South China Morning Post explained.
The U.S. Navy possesses 11 nuclear-powered carriers plus nine assault ships that can embark F-35B jump jets. The gap between the Americans’ 20 carriers and China’s possible eventual fleet of four flattops underscores the United States’s decades-long spending advantage.
“Despite China's increase in military spending, the U.S. continues to spend far more money,” MIT Technology Reviewexplained. The U.S. defense budget recently has exceeded $700 billion annually, while China typically spends around $250 billion.
“The size of America's lead in annual military spending obscures just how much this difference has accumulated over the decades,” MIT Technology Review continued.
“More than any other single technology, aircraft carriers enable the American military to project force almost anywhere in the world,” the MIT publication concluded. In that important measure of military might, China is far behind the United States -- and might never catch up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Putin set for landmark Paris talks on Ukraine conflict</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: Russian leader Vladimir Putin will for the first time hold formal talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky over the conflict in Ukraine's east on Monday, in a much-anticipated summit in Paris.
No comprehensive peace deal is expected from the afternoon meeting - mediated by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - but diplomats hope that the exercise will help to boost trust between the two men.
Thousands have been killed and one million have fled their homes since pro-Russia militias in eastern Ukraine launched a bid for independence in 2014 - kicking off a conflict that deepened Russia's estrangement from the West.
The separatists seized control of Donetsk and Lugansk regions shortly after Russia's annexation of Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula.
Diplomats have emphasised that the issue of Crimea - a seizure that gave Putin a popularity boost but led to international sanctions being imposed - is not on the table at the summit.
Kiev has made clear its determination to never give up the peninsula, which the international community still regards as part of Ukraine.
The Kremlin has sent signals that it is ready to work with Zelensky, who Putin has described as "likeable" and "sincere".
But Putin also will not want to return empty-handed and will be pushing for an easing of sanctions.
"PROBLEM OF TRUST"
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Funke newspaper group ahead of the summit "we have to do everything we can ... to make progress in the Ukrainian peace process", and described the conflict as "a festering wound in Europe".
Maas praised Zelensky for bringing "new momentum" to the talks, adding that "to make progress with the next difficult steps, Russia needs to make a move too".
The goals of Monday's meeting include agreeing to disband illegal militias, the departure of foreign fighters from Donetsk and Lugansk and Ukraine taking back control over its border with Russia, according to a French presidential source.
"There remains the problem of trust between the parties. This needs to be created before we can move forward," said the source, who asked not to be named.
Also key is agreeing a calendar for elections to be held in Donetsk and Lugansk under Ukrainian law with the two regions enjoying special status - an idea known as the Steinmeier Formula.
"If the summit meeting is to be meaningful, it should have a result, and the result should very much be on the Steinmeier Formula," said Gerhard Mangott, professor of international relations at Austria's Innsbruck University.
"It remains to be seen whether Ukraine is willing to give up some of its pre-conditions for implementing the Steinmeier Formula."
"WOUND OF WAR"
Monday's meeting is the first such summit in three years and seeks to implement accords signed in Minsk in 2015 that call for the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the restoration of Kiev's control over its borders, wider autonomy, and the holding of local elections.
The French presidential source said it was not just Putin's strategic calculations that had impeded the implementation of the Minsk accords but also the "difficulties in Ukraine due to public opinion, divisions and the fundamental wound caused by the war."
The summit is a hugely delicate event for everyone involved, but particularly for Zelensky, who is under pressure not to cede ground to the Kremlin.
For Macron, the summit is a centrepiece of an increasingly bold foreign policy he is driving despite troubles at home, where transport workers have been on strike for days in a dispute over pension reforms.
Macron, who shocked NATO allies this year by declaring the alliance brain dead, has made clear his belief that Europe needs a strategic partnership with Russia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Day 5 of public transport chaos as French strike bites</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: French commuters and tourists braced for a fifth day of public transport chaos Monday (Dec 9) as the government prepared to respond to widespread anger over pension reform that has sparked open-ended walkouts.
President Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and senior cabinet ministers met late Sunday to discuss the contentious reform, which the country's powerful labour unions claim will force many to work longer for a smaller retirement payout.
As both the government and unions vowed to stand firm, businesses started counting the costs of the strike which began last Thursday when some 800,000 people took to the streets across France in a mass rejection of plans to introduce a single, points-based pension scheme, unifying 42 existing plans.
The stoppages stranded commuters, closed schools, and hit tourism and Christmas retail.
Many people opted to take days off or to work from home, but thousands had no choice but to squeeze into perilously overcrowded suburban trains and metros whose numbers were slashed to a minimum.
The biggest labour unrest in years came as France's economy is already dented by more than a year of weekly anti-government demonstrations by so-called "yellow vest" activists protesting unemployment and waning spending power.
Many are opposed to Macron's plans for putting the country on a solid economic footing, of which the retirement overhaul forms a major part.
RETAILERS IN "JEOPARDY"
Business owners fear for their bottom line, with concerns over delivery of goods if the strike continues, and client numbers dwindling at the height of the Christmas shopping season.
On Thursday and Friday, strikers blocked several fuel depots around France, causing long petrol station queues as worried motorists stocked up.
The first day of the stoppage already caused an average 30 per cent drop in sales, according to the Alliance of Commerce which represents 27,000 supermarkets and clothing and shoe stores with almost 200,000 workers.
The Union of Local Enterprises warned that prolonged unrest "could be fatal for many" small businesses.
A hotel association said reservations in the larger Paris region dropped by 30-40 per cent on the first day of the strike.
But it was not only local travel that was affected. Regional and international trains, including the Thalys and Eurostar, were also hobbled by the unrest, and several flights were cancelled on the first days of the strike.
The chaos was set to continue on Monday, with the three main rail unions calling for industrial action to be stepped up ahead of another general strike and mass protests on Tuesday.
"In the coming days, we recommend avoiding public transport," said the website of the RATP train, tram, bus and metro company on which some 10 million passengers in larger Paris area rely daily to get to work.
Trains connecting the suburbs to the centre of Paris will only have a third to half of the normal number of trains running at peak hours Monday, the company said.
Ten out of the RATP's 16 metro lines will be shut, four will offer limited services, and only the two driverless lines will run as scheduled, but with a "risk of congestion" during peak hours.
All 14 metro lines that rely on drivers were closed on Sunday.
Inter-city rail operator SNCF warned of potentially "dangerous" overcrowding, with availability reduced to about 15-20 per cent.
Travel will be "extremely complicated," said SNCF spokeswoman Agnes Ogier, urging commuters to make other arrangements, including carpooling. She did not expect any improvement by Tuesday.
Two-thirds to three-quarters of high-speed international trains will run as scheduled.
The capital's main roads, meanwhile, were expected to be more congested than usual as many non-striking workers opt to drive to work.
A week of conflict likely lies ahead, with Jean-Paul Delevoye, whom Macron appointed to lead the pension reform project, set to unveil the outcome of his months-long consultations on Monday, followed by Philippe announcing the final details of the proposed reform plan on Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Acai bowls look pretty and delicious, but are they good for you?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Lifestyle Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:12:04 pm

Acai bowls have been flooding our Instagram feeds for years now, and with good reason. They’re photogenic, delicious and healthy. The bowl gets its name from Açaí (pronounced ah-sigh-EE) which comes from the acai berry grown on the acai palm tree in South Amerian rainforests.
Now that you know a little about acai, what is an acai bowl?

The acai bowl, which originated in Brazil, is made of frozen acai palm fruit that is pureed and served as a smoothie in a bowl or glass. In Brazil, acai bowls are typically topped with granola, banana and various syrups. The sweeter versions are usually topped with nuts and exotic fruits, while the salty versions are topped with shrimp or dried fish.
Since acai berries are grown so far away, fresh ones are rarely available in India. Instead, freeze-dried powders or purees are often used to create the base of the bowl. These are mixed with a combination of ingredients such as almond milk, soy milk, nut butter, frozen fruit and fruit juice to achieve the desired thick consistency and taste.
This base is put in a bowl and topped with a few ingredients, such as granola, honey, nut butter or fresh fruit.
Are Acai bowls healthy?

All the ingredients and toppings are pretty healthy, but bringing them together in the same dish raises a substantial issue — sugar. So as good as they look, are they good for your body too?
Remember to always look at acai bowls as more of an occasional treat, not something you’d have as a meal or a hearty breakfast. We say this because, as mentioned earlier, the ingredients in the base are acai puree and other fruits like berries and bananas, and granola toppings. It’s relatively high in vitamin C and fibre, but it contains a whopping amount of sugar.
Many people eat acai bowls for breakfast or a snack, thinking it is healthy. This way, the sugar content becomes even more of a concern. We know that consuming too much sugar has been linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other negative health outcomes and diseases. While acai bowls have a lot of good things going, their typical sky-high sugar count cannot be overlooked.
Can you enjoy an acai bowl every once in a while? Without a shadow of doubt, yes! But you shouldn’t be eating them for breakfast or lunch several times a week. A smarter approach might involve replacing desserts like ice-cream or frozen yoghurt with an occasional acai bowl.

Manchester City and United players react after items thrown at Fred at Etihad stadium (Source: AP)
There’s no such thing as too much football. That was proved during this football-heavy week as the Premier League saw matches almost every day. Then came the weekend with action in other leagues as well. This week saw Manchester’City’s momentum dip further after a derby loss to Manchester United and some wonder goals.
Manchester derby leaves City’s hopes in tatters
He started the week with critics saying his job was on the line, but with two wins in the week, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ensured his stay at Old Trafford won’t end any time soon. His side beat Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur by outsmarting mastermind managers Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho respectively.
City’s title hopes were dented further after they suffered a 2-1 derby defeat, leaving Guardiola’s champions 14 points behind leaders Liverpool. Goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial put United 2-0 up at the break and City only pulled one back in the 85th minute through Nicolas Otamendi.
Football racism not restricted to just Italy
Despite making a statement at the Etihad, what also made headlines was the racism directed at the United duo of Fred and Jesse Lingard. As a corner was about to be taken, Fred and Lingard were targeted with racist abuse, and objects thrown at them by Manchester City fans.
Cameras even captured an incident in the second half where a 41-year-old man made monkey-like gestures at the United duo. British police on Sunday arrested the man after the video went viral.
An angry Solskjaer said after the match, “I’ve seen it on the video. Fred and Jesse in the corner taking coins from the City fans first of all, so they’ve got to go away. And then there’s this not-so-intelligent fella chanting racist abuse towards my two players and I hope City and the authorities will deal with it, because he shouldn’t be watching football again. Not live, anyway.”
“We have to stamp it out. We keep talking about it every single week and it’s not acceptable. He should not be allowed back into a ground. That’s how simple it is,” he said.
Stand-out goals
Luis Suarez came up with a superb shot using the back of his foot as Barcelona beat RCD Mallorca 5-2. Describing it the ‘best goal’ of his career, Suarez was quoted by Marca as saying, “I knew that it was a tight angle and the last option I had was to hit it with my heel. I was looking to bounce it because I had very little chance against the goalkeeper. It’s the best goal of my career.”
Son Heung Min also mesmerised the fans with a wonder goal as Tottenham Hotspurs beat Burnley 5-0. Collecting the ball just outside his own penalty box, Son dribbled 80 yards, and past almost the entire Burnley team, in 12 seconds to score.
Jose Mourinho dubbed the South Korean as ‘Son-aldo,’ recalling a goal from the Brazilian striker Ronaldo while he was in Barcelona. “Before this goal my son calls him Son-aldo and today he was Son-aldo!” Mourinho said. “This was an amazing goal. I know that he is going to reach the face of the keeper, his control is unstoppable. The keeper is good, but he managed to put it in.”
Messi with another good week
On Monday, football star Lionel Messi won a record sixth Ballon d’Or. On Friday, the Argentine footballer, who is the top scorer with 12 goals in 10 games, took home the La Liga Player of the month. And this is despite the 32-year old missing the first four games of the season due to injury. On Saturday, he scored a hat-trick as Barcelona moved back top of La Liga with a 5-2 victory over Real Mallorca.
Messi finally beat Cristiano Ronaldo’s La Liga hat-trick record, scoring in the 17th with a superb curling left-footed shot into the top corner and then with another well-placed strike from outside the area in the 41st. He completed his record 35th league hat trick from inside the area in the 83rd after Suarez’s pass.
Real Madrid are right next to their rivals at the top with the same number of points after beating Espanyol. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid stretched their winless run to four games in all competitions. After being held to a 0-0 draw at Villarreal, Atletico are sixth in the table on 26 points from 16 games.
Juventus suffer first loss of the season
Defending Italian champions Juventus slipped to their first Serie A loss this season, a 3-1 defeat by Lazio. Luiz Felipe, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Felipe Caicedo scored at the Stadio Olimpico as Lazio recovered from an early goal by Cristiano Ronaldo. Simone Inzaghi-led Lazio are now three points shy of second-placed Juventus. Inter Milan remains at the top with a two point lead.
On the other hand in Bundesliga, Borussia Monchengladbach made major strides to remain at the top of the table with 31 points, as they defeated holders Bayern Munich 2-1, owing Ramy Bensebaini’s brace. Just behind them are RB Leipzig who are on 30 points, after their 3-1 win against Hoffenheim. While Borussia Dortmund are third with 26 points, Bayern are seventh after two consecutive defeats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: How govt proposes to regulate the dismantling of ships</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Explained Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:10:02 pm
The ship-recycling industry is a labour-intensive sector, the release said, and is susceptible to concerns on environmental safety.
Lok Sabha last week (on December 3) passed The Recycling of Ships Bill, 2019, which seeks to restrict the use of hazardous material on ships, and regulates the recycling of ships.
The Bill, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet on November 20, was introduced in Parliament by Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh L Mandaviya on November 25.
A government release issued at the time the Bill was cleared by the Cabinet pointed out that India is the leader in the global ship recycling industry, with a share of over 30% of the market.
As per the Review of Maritime Transport, 2018 report published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in 2017, India demolished 6,323 tonnes of known ship scrapping worldwide.
The ship-recycling industry is a labour-intensive sector, the release said, and is susceptible to concerns on environmental safety.
The Bill restricts and prohibits the use or installation of hazardous material, irrespective of whether a ship is meant for recycling or not.
For new ships, the restrictions/prohibitions will come into effect along with the law (when notified). Existing ships will have five years to comply with the requirements of the law.
According to a note on the Bill prepared by PRS Legislative Research, the Bill will apply to:
(i) any new or existing ship which is registered in India,
(ii) ships entering a port or terminal in India, or the territorial waters of India,
(iii) any warship, or other ship owned and operated by an administration and used on government non-commercial service, and
(iv) ship recycling facilities operating in India.
The Bill defines this as the dismantling of a ship at a designated facility in order to recover its components and materials for reuse, and taking care of the hazardous material so produced.
Ship recycling includes associated operations such as storage and treatment of materials and components on site, the PRS note says.
Under the proposed law, ships will be recycled only in authorised recycling facilities. An application to authorise such a facility must be submitted to the Competent Authority notified by the central government, along with a ship recycling facility management plan and the prescribed fee.
All existing ship recycling facilities will be required to apply for authorisation within 60 days of the commencement of the Act. The certificate of authorisation will be valid for a period as specified, but not exceeding five years, according to the PRS note.

There is a lot more at stake than World Test Championship points for Pakistan when they host Sri Lanka in a two-match series this month as the country hosts its first tests on home soil since the 2009 militant attack on Sri Lanka’s team bus in Lahore.
That attack left six security personnel and two civilians dead and six players injured and saw Pakistan spend the next decade in the test wilderness as teams refused to play there. With the country’s cricket board (PCB) giving assurances that Pakistan was safe to travel, Sri Lanka returned to play several limited-overs matches earlier this year, though 10 key players opted out citing security concerns.
Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne said it was now time to bring Test cricket back to Pakistan. “After the 2009 incident, players were scared to travel to Pakistan,” he said in a PCB podcast.
“But our Twenty20 and ODI teams have toured the country and they told us that security and other arrangements were really good. “All our guys are ready to play. We are looking forward to a good series in Pakistan.” The series, which begins in Rawalpindi on Wednesday, will be as much a test of Pakistan’s organisational abilities as its cricketing skills.
The PCB has promised watertight security for the tour and has invited Bandula Warnapura and Javed Miandad, captains in the first test between the teams in 1982, for the series opener. “December 11 will be a very special day in Pakistan cricket history and it is appropriate that it is celebrated with Bandula Warnapura and Javed Miandad on our side,” PCB Chairman Ehsan Mani said in a statement. “PCB will continue to hold similar events … as we are now on the road to hosting regular international cricket at home.”
Pakistan, who were forced to play their “home” tests at neutral venues, will look to use the series as an opportunity to bounce back after being swept 2-0 in Australia, suffering innings defeats both in Brisbane and Adelaide. Sri Lanka will be playing under new head coach Mickey Arthur, who only took charge last Thursday and will start his tenure against his former employers Pakistan.

The tourists suffered a blow hours before their departure for Pakistan on Sunday when quick Suranga Lakmal was ruled out of the series with dengue fever. Uncapped Asitha Fernando, currently playing in the South Asian Games in Nepal, will join the squad ahead of the second test in Karachi from Dec. 19.
The series is part of the World Test Championship, which sees the top nine test nations face-off over a two-year period, scoring points based on their success and culminating in a final at Lord’s in June 2021.

This was the longest construction ban, a pollution control measure under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), that had been enforced in winter months for the past few years. (Representational Image)
The Supreme Court on Monday partially lifted its ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR, allowing work from 6 am to 6 pm, even as the air quality in the national capital remained in the “very poor” category for the sixth consecutive day.
Taking into account the report of the Central Pollution Control Board, the Supreme Court permitted construction activities during the day but the ban would be enforced during the night.
The apex court also directed Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh to submit a report on the stubble burning in each state by December 11.
On the other hand, the Centre told the apex court they have set up a high-level committee, in association with IIT, to examine the use of technology like smog towers to combat pollution.
Earlier in November, the apex court imposed a ban on all kinds of construction work in view of the rising pollution levels in the national capital. The apex court had said dust emanating from construction sites was one of the major internal contributors to air pollution in the capital. The court also said that a fine of Rs 1 lakh would be imposed on those violating the order.
The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) had imposed a partial ban on construction activities during October 26-30 between 6 pm and 6 am as a measure to control deteriorating air quality, which had reached emergency levels on November 3.
Since October 30, the EPCA, advised by a task force led by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), has been extending the ban. From November 1 to 5, a complete ban was ordered by EPCA until the Supreme Court, on November 4, directed that all construction activities in Delhi-NCR be stopped until further orders.
This is the longest that a construction ban, a pollution control measure under the Graded Response Action Plan, has been enforced in winter months for the past few years. Last year the ban was imposed from November 1-12. In 2017, it was for an eight-day period from November 8.
On November 30, the apex court had made an exception on its ban on construction activity for the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) at Pragati Maidan.
Delhi-NCR witnessed one of the worst episodes of smog this year, with AQI hovering between 490 and 500. Schools were directed to remain shut in view of the rising pollution, and the Delhi government’s odd-even scheme was also brought into force.

Despite India’s progress, it accounts for 28 per cent of the 1.3 billion multidimensional poor, the report said. (Representational Image)
Making a marginal improvement, India climbed one spot to be placed at 129 among 189 countries in the 2019 Human Development Index (HDI) report released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on Monday. Last year, India ranked 130 in the index.
In India, 27.1 crore people were lifted out of poverty from 2005-06 to 2015-16, UNDP India representative Shoko Noda said. The steady progress was due to nearly three decades of rapid development, which had seen a dramatic reduction in absolute poverty, along with gains in life expectancy, education, and access to health care, she said.
The report further stated that India’s HDI value increased by 50 per cent, from 0.431 to 0.647 per cent, placing it above the average for countries in the medium human development group (0.634) and above the average for other south Asian countries (0.642).
The HDI is measured in three basic dimensions of human development for assessing long-term progress — a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living.
The report shows that from 1990-2018 life expectancy increased by 11.6 years and per capita income rose by 250 per cent.
Despite India’s progress, it accounts for 28 per cent of the 1.3 billion multidimensional poor, the report said. The report also noted that despite the slight progress, gender-based inequalities still persisted in the country, affecting women.
India ranks at a low 122 among 162 countries on the Gender Development Index. “For countries like India, which have shown great success in reducing absolute poverty, we hope that 2019 Human Development Report sheds light on inequalities and deprivations that go beyond income,” said Shoko Noda.
“India’s development initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (for financial inclusion) and Ayushman Bharat (for universal health care) are crucial in ensuring that we meet our promise to leave no one behind and fulfil the Prime Minister’s vision of development for all,” she further said.
The three basic dimensions of human development are measured in different ways. A long and healthy life is measured by life expectancy.
Knowledge level is measured by mean years of schooling among the adult population — which is the average number of years of schooling received in a life-time by people aged 25 years and older — and access to learning and knowledge by expected years of schooling for children of school-entry age — which is the total number of years of schooling a child of school-entry age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates stay the same throughout the child’s life.
Standard of living is measured by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita expressed in constant 2011 international dollars converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates.

“People, my father is not Courtney Walsh,” is what Hayden Walsh has to keep reminding anyone who thinks that he is a progeny of one of West Indies’ pace bowling greats.
However after an impactful performance against India, the 27-year-old leg-spinner is confident that he will now be able to carve an identity of his own, where deceptive googlies will be discussed more than lethal bouncers.
“I was playing in the Cananda T20 league and someone called me Courtney Walsh (laughs). So yeah…People my father is not Courtney Walsh. But I guess now they will now find out who I am and who is my father,” Walsh, who had figures of 2/28, including wickets of Shivam Dube and Shreyas Iyer said after the match.
He foxed a rampaging Dube with a loopy googly outside the off-stump, a trait he has developed bowling to southpaws like Evin Lewis and Nicholas Pooran.
“I was bowling a lot to Evin (Lewis) and Nicholas (Pooran) in the nets. I was a bit confident coming in to bowl to him (Dube),” Walsh said.
He was visibly elated as he is finally finding his feet in international cricket.
“Yeah, it has been like a roller-coaster ride for me. As you can see, I have been working hard trying to find my way to the top into international cricket. Just to be here and perform in a game is just. I am over the moon,” he added.
He credited his consistent show in the Caribbean Premier League as one of the reasons for his success.
“I did well in the Caribbean Premier League and it obviously caught the selectors’ eye. I bowled a lot in the nets and it helped me here,” Walsh said.
He wouldn’t mind IPL scouts taking a note of his performances but the primary goal now will be to win the series.
“Yeah well, the main thing is more to win the series. The goal is just winning this series and to help the team do their best.”
To a question if winning the toss was crucial for the Windies, Walsh replied: “Yeah, I think the toss as you saw in Hyderabad, it was very important because of the dew factor. I don’t think dew was much of a factor tonight.
“But knowing that we were going to bowl first and we have such a strong bowling team. Once we do well, we would be able to restrict them to a good total.”

The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
Apple has acknowledged the popping sound issues on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The tech giant says the popping sound coming from the speakers of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a software issue, according to a memo obtained by MacRumors. The company says it will roll out a fix through a software update in the near future. The company advises its Authorised Service providers not to repair or replace the affected MacBook Pros due to it.
As reported by MacRumors, users have taken to Apple Support Communities and Reddit to raise their voice about the popping sound issues. Multiple users have reported hearing popping or clicking sounds coming from the speakers when playing audio or video. The popping sound usually occurs after a user has stopped playing a video or audio. One user has suggested that the issue could be related to Final Cut Pro X. It is unclear when Apple plans to fix the issue, but Apple is currently working on it.
Another issue that has surfaced is slow-response time from the 16-inch MacBook Pro wide-colour display. This issue results in a “ghosting” when scrolling text.

Just last month, Apple released a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that succeeded the original 15-inch MacBook Pro, which has now been permanently discontinued. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is pitched as a premium notebook designed to meet the expectations of video editors, musicians, artists, etc. The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
With the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has made a number of changes to make the new computer standout. Perhaps the most visible change comes in the form of a redesigned keyboard that ditches the flat “butterfly” keyboard, as well as a new thermal architecture. Apple has also improved battery life on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.

Shivam Dube is confident that he can “clear any ground” in the world after providing a demo of his six-hitting prowess against the West Indies in the second T20 International, albeit in a losing cause.
Promoted up the order at No 3, Dube smashed 54 off 30 balls with four sixes, three of which came in one over from rival skipper Kieron Pollard but India failed to defend a target of 170 with three-match series leveled at 1-1.
“I think this ground is big but I have the capability of clearing any ground. You might have seen today also and that’s the capability I have,” the big-bodied Dube said at the post-match press conference.
Initially, Dube was unable to clear the ropes as he relied more on power than timing which didn’t work for him. However, the Mumbai player believes that power will always remain his USP.
“I think that’s my strength and I always go like that only,” he added. When he was struggling with his timing, it was vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who urged the youngster to stay calm and back his strength, which was exactly the advice that he needed at that juncture.
“I think I was given the opportunity to bat at No. 3 and I think it was a big deal for me. The pressure was there at the starting obviously – international match.”
“After that, Rohit Bhai helped me and he said ‘stay calm and back your strength’. I think that was the motivation I needed from a senior player. Then, I got one six and did really well after that,” he added. Dube said that dropped catches are a part and parcel of this game.
“Yes, we dropped catches and it was unfortunate. Had we held onto them, that would have changed everything. But then any team can drop catches – it doesn’t matter. I think we are the best team. We had a tough match today, but we will come back next match,” he said.

UN experts and activists say China has detained possibly 1 million Uighurs in mass detention camps in Xinjiang. China says the camps are part of an anti-terror crackdown and are providing vocational training.
The counter-terrorism measures in Xinjiang are no different from anti-terrorism measures in the United States, Xinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir told reporters in Beijing.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING: Recent US legislation on Xinjiang is a severe violation of international law and gross interference in China's internal affairs, the governor of the far western region said on Monday (Dec 9), accusing the United States of launching a smear campaign.
Tension has flared in recent weeks between China and the United States over issues such as Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority and protesters in Hong Kong, complicating prospects for a near-term deal to end a 17-month long trade war.
Last week, the US House of Representatives passed a Bill requiring a tougher response to Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority. UN experts and activists say China has detained possibly 1 million Uighurs in camps in Xinjiang.
China, which has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs, says the camps are part of an anti-terror crackdown and provide vocational training.
The counter-terrorism measures in Xinjiang are no different from anti-terrorism measures in the United States, the region's governor, Shohrat Zakir, told reporters in Beijing.
The United States has chosen to turn a blind eye to Xinjiang's social stability, and is launching a smear campaign against the region and using issues there to sow discord among ethnic groups in China, he added.
Any attempt to disable Xinjiang is doomed to fail, said Zakir, who is also deputy secretary of the Xinjiang Communist Party.
Human rights groups and former detainees have said conditions in the camps are poor, with inmates subject to psychological and physical abuse.
At Zakir's news conference in the Chinese capital, images of past violence were displayed in excerpts from an English-language documentary, Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang, aired on China's state broadcaster CGTN.
The Uighur Bill, which was passed 407-1 in the Democratic-controlled House, requires the US president to condemn abuses against Muslims and calls for the closure of the camps in Xinjiang.
It also calls on President Donald Trump to impose sanctions for the first time on a member of China's powerful politburo, Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar I-Pace Gets 12 More Miles Of Range From New Software Update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The rumors are true, and Jaguar I-Pace owners can soon visit their local dealer for a free update to boost the electric vehicle's range. The improved software can add up to 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the crossover range.
Jaguar says that the tweaks include optimizations to the battery management, thermal systems, and all-wheel drive torque improvements. The regenerative braking also harvests more energy at low speeds, and the range calculation on the instrument panel is more accurate than before. In an example of race cars improving road-going models, the company says that technical knowhow from the I-Pace eTrophy series is the major contributor to making these upgrades.

"The Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy has generated a huge amount of data for us to analyze and those marginal gains, derived from competition on the track, are now being applied to customers’ cars to further enhance their driving experience," said Stephen Boulter, I-Pace Vehicle Engineering Manager, in the software update's announcement.
The 2020 I-Pace has an EPA-estimated range of 234 miles (377 kilometers) before this update. Jag notes that is upgrade doesn't change that figure. However, the company's testing shows the tweaked software provides an eight percent boost in range "dependent on usage."
As an extra bonus, this software upgrade also enhances the I-Pace's ability to get over-the-air updates in the future by making more of the vehicle's electronic modules available for improvements.
Jaguar seems serious about eventually adding a high-performance version of the I-Pace to the lineup, and it would likely take significant inspiration from the eTrophy racer. Expect the model to have a boost in output and possibly a larger battery to keep the range up. Unfortunately, the vehicle could still be years away because the SVO division is working on other projects.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shocking pictures and videos show the minutes after a volcano in New Zealand erupted Monday, killing at least five and injuring many more.
According to New Zealand’s geological monitoring agency, GeoNet, the White Island volcano, also known as Whakaari, erupted around 2:11 p.m. local time, blasting a huge plume of smoke into the sky.
The volcano is a popular tourist destination and there were around 100 people on the island at the time of the eruption, according to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand Herald reported. Police had previously said around 50 people were on the island at the time.
Tourists posted pictures and videos of the eruption to social media, which can be seen below:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rangers and Celtic target Jarrad Branthwaite struggling with weight of £1m interest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rangers and Celtic target Jarrad Branthwaite's boss at Carlisle United has conceded the club will 'do their best for everyone' as both Celtic and Rangers scouts watched him again at the weekend.
The 17-year-old central defender has been linked with a £1 million move to Glasgow after bursting onto the scene this season with the English League Two club.
But the Old Firm also face major competition with Manchester City, Leicester City and Arsenal all linked with him too.
Scouts from both the Parkhead and Ibrox clubs watched him play in an unusual defensive midfielder role in Carlisle's weekend draw at Morecambe.
And new Carlisle boss Chris Beech admits he expects offers to be made next month.
He said: "The speculation is a challenge for him. I don’t think it’s my job to talk about how hard it will be to keep him - I think it’s the club’s.
"They’ve got to do what’s best for everybody and everything. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. It’s very difficult for him to deal with that as a player.
"At the weekend, I had the choice, I could bring him back in the squad and sit him on the bench, or get him back on the pitch. I wanted him on the pitch.
“I felt Jarrad has the ability to pass and switch play. We didn’t use him enough. But he won all his headers, did an immense, strong tackle in the first half, and was excellent in terms of having a go at what he was trying to achieve.
"Jarrad, I’ve seen him now for about 10 days, and I’ve coached a lot of very good young players, but he is excellent. I had Dale Stephens at 17, he plays Premier League football for Brighton now.
"And Jarrad is definitely better than Dale at the same age."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Russia's doping ban doesn't spell good news for Scotland's Euro 2020 hopes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia have been banned from major sporting events for four years but it won't have an effect on their Euro 2020 qualification.
They won't be allowed to compete at the Qatar World Cup in 2022 or the Tokyo Olympics next year.
But Scotland fans who may have hoped that their doping could give the Tartan Army automatic qualification for the Euro 2020 will be left disappointed.
Russia will still be allowed to compete at the tournament next summer with Saint Petersburg also still allowed to host games.
The city has games in the group and quarter final but WADA's ban means Russia aren't allowed to host major sporting events either.
However, UEFA's isn't viewed as a 'Major Sporting Organisation' by the International Standard for Code Compliance by Signatories.
The ISCCS lay out the rules on doping breaches and their definition of a Major Sporting Organisation is "continental association of National Olympic Committees and other international multisport organisations that function as a ruling body for any continental, regional or other international event."
That means that because UEFA are a governing body for a single sport rather than multiple, Euro 2020 isn't covered.
The code does cover single sport world championships and that is why they will be banned from the 2022 World Cup - hosted by FIFA rather than UEFA.
UEFA have said they won't be making any contact at this stage following the announcement.
The 2021 Champions League Final is also due to be held in the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg.
Russia finished in second place in Scotland's group for Euro 2020 qualifying with two victories over Steve Clarke's men.

    <h5 class="mb-1">If Rangers scored offside winner Celtic would want foreign refs and a public inquiry - Ibrox blogger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">That was tough to take.
It wasn’t because Rangers were outplayed and outfought or didn’t turn up like Old Firm defeat earlier this season at Ibrox.
This was a sore one because it was like experiencing my Rangers-supporting childhood in reverse.
Instead of watching Rangers being battered for the majority of a game and Celtic not having it in them to get over the line, it was the other way about for us on Sunday.
And yes, we can point to progress under Steven Gerrard and the fact we did batter Celtic for the majority of the game but it seemed like Fraser Forster had morphed into Andy Goram with the number of outstanding saves he pulled off.
It left every Rangers fan in the ground exasperated. It almost felt as if we were like Tommy Burns’ Celtic side.
When you create so many chances and play against 10 men for just under half an hour and miss a penalty, that’s on you. This Rangers side has to learn how to take advantage of these types of situations when they are presented to them.
On the back of this result, Rangers’ mentality will be questioned, as it has been since they have come back to top-flight, and rightly so in some case.
At Hampden, I would suggest it was more to do with good goalkeeping from Forster than a serious mentality issue.
However, others will, rightly, point to Celtic’s mentality: battered for the majority of the game then they score with their first shot on target and see it out with 10 men to win the trophy.
Football is a strange game in that regard, Rangers couldn’t be faulted and were by far the better side on the day. If it was a boxing bout Collum could’ve stopped it after the first 20 minutes but it just wasn’t meant to be. We could have played until next Sunday and not found the net.
And that brings me to Alfredo Morelos – he has to stop letting this Celtic hoodoo of his get inside his head. When he’s up against them, you can never fault the wee man’s effort or commitment to the cause.
In fact, at times he tries too hard and often looks like a guy who has all the pressure in the world upon his shoulders as he seems desperate to score.
I am no footballer and it would be ridiculous of me to tell a 25-goal striker how to go about his business, but relax Alfredo, play the game, not the occasion and that elusive goal will come your way.
Other than Rangers’ missed chances, the Celtic goal was offside. And yes, you do make your own luck at times and Celtic deserve some credit for digging it out, but it wouldn’t be a Willie Collum refereeing performance if he or his assistants didn’t get at least one big decision wrong.
I understand why Steven Gerrard is an advocate for VAR and should it come in, it would help change these clear and obvious errors.
However, if the shoe was on the other foot and that had been Connor Goldson who was offside, we would be in the middle of a public inquiry and calls for foreign refs to be brought in and maybe even another referee strike. Collum is an average-at-best referee yet he continues to get the big games in this country. It’s embarrassing.
Rangers have to make sure there are no more slip-ups this month. The players have to use the hurt they are feeling and make sure they get past Young Boys and pick up as many points as possible in the league until the winter break.
The next five games will tell us all we need to know about the mentality of this Rangers side and now there are no grey areas. Winners find ways to win even when they are playing terrible.
If Rangers want to be competing for silverware at the end of the season, this is exactly what this team needs to do going forward.
This group of players are not terrible, despite what other people would have you believe, but they need to learn together how to get over the line.
At this moment in time, it may feel like the end of the world, and that the season could collapse, but there is a long way to go and still time for Rangers to right this wrong at the end of the month.
Most of all they must, simply must, not turn into Burns’ Celtic as I alluded to earlier. As much we all can appreciate nice football, if you don’t win much, then what’s the point? You can console yourself with hard-luck stories but those don’t sit in the trophy room at the end of the season.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the festive season gets into full swing, Facebook feeds across the globe are full of naughty elves causing mischief.
And this week the Advertiser discovered the cutest Elf on the Shelf EVER as little one-year-old Parker McShane causes all sorts of mischief at his home in Coatbridge.
Parker’s mum Shannen felt her little boy was too young to appreciate getting an elf on the shelf, so gave him the role of the elf in their house.
She said: “I loved doing Elf on the Shelf so much when I was a nursery teacher and knew Parker was too little to understand it.
“So I decided to make him the elf and just have fun doing naughty things every morning!”
Mischievous little Parker has been a busy elf. So far he has managed to cover his dad David’s face with lipstick, mess up the kitchen with chocolate and cereal, put balls down the toilet and unwrap toilet paper all over the floor!
And Shannen is sure there is lots more to come in December, as Parker loves being an Elf so much he is refusing to take his outfit off.
She added: “He loves it and is getting away with being naughty and likes us telling him how he cute he is as an elf.”
Shannen’s Facebook friends have been loving finding out what little Parker the Elf has been up to each day.
One said: “Aww that’s amazing!”
Another added: “I love that idea! He’s just adorable too! Cutest elf I have ever seen!”
While another wrote: “This is amazing. He looks so pleased, wee soul.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lenny Bruce From ‘Marvelous Mrs Maisel’ Was a Real Comedian, and His Life Was as Drama-Filled as the Show Depicts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’stitular character, Midge, is fictional, but the New York City of the 1960s that she lives in is very, very real. The sights, the sounds, the Gaslight—they’re all representative of the city during that time. Another very real part of this show? Lenny Bruce (played on the show by Luke Kirby), Midge’s comedy BFF and the guy voted most likely to bail her out of jail. Lenny and Midge have a very unexpected friendship, and all the arrests and drama and controversy that Lenny Bruce found himself in the show also happened IRL. Here's what we know.
According to his website, Leonard Alfred Schneider was born on Long Island, in Mineola, New York, on October 13, 1925. (A Libra! Naturally!) His mother was an actress and stage performer and his dad was a shoe clerk—luckily, for the entirety of American culture, Lenny took after his mother and dedicated himself to a life on the stage.
His first controversial performance came when he dressed in drag for his naval shipmates when he was stationed in Italy during World War II. After an honorable discharge in 1945, Bruce moved to New York City to make it as a comedian, eventually settling on Lenny Bruce as his stage name. He spent years honing his act, and was, as his website says, dubbed a “sick” comedian because he didn’t shy away from ranting about religion, patriotism, race, drugs, abortions, you name it—he had strong opinions and he wasn’t about to be quiet about them.

Bruce was arrested on obscenity charges in real life just as he was on Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. He was charged with violating obscenity laws all over the world, and that speech he gave Midge at the end of Season 1 talking about all the money he’s giving lawyers? That was true, too, because he had run out of places that would allow him to play. In 1964, he was arrested, charged, and brought to trial on an obscenity charge in New York City following a particularly dirty set at Cafe Au Go Go.
Ephraim London, then one of the country’s best First Amendment lawyers, represented Bruce, who was ultimately convicted (although he was posthumously pardoned by Governor George Pataki in 2003). By 1966, Bruce couldn’t find anywhere to play because no club wanted to deal with being slapped with an obscenity charge for hosting his act.
Bruce struggled with addiction, and he died on August 3, 1966, following an accidental morphine overdose in his Los Angeles home. He’s buried in Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.
Right now, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is set at the beginning of the 1960s, so there are a handful of years to go before Bruce’s death. As Bruce is such a central character on the show at the moment (according to Vanity Fair, Bruce’s daughter, Kitty, visited the set of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel to help Kirby in playing her father), it will be particularly sad to watch Midge’s star rise while Bruce’s starts to fall.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fulfilling promises
(Image credit: OnePlus)
When OnePlus TV was announced, they made it clear that the software was a big part of the experience. However, Netflix wasn’t natively available back then on the smart TV. That is finally changing with a new software update.
The OnePlus smart TV Q1 and Q1 Pro were made their global debut in India, alongside the OnePlus 7T. Back then, the company promised that Netflix would be a part of the included app ecosystem at a future date. Starting today, all OnePlus TVs sold will have Netflix pre-installed, whereas existing users will receive a software update that will add the entire content catalog of the OTT platform.
The OnePlus TV remote originally had a rather minimal design with only a few buttons, one of them being Prime Video by Amazon. Video streaming platforms usually have a mandate for a dedicated button to launch their app if a smart TV wants to have their content natively supported. It raised a few questions during the launch about how OnePlus will add support for Netflix as the remote had no extra buttons.
The solution came in the form of a new remote, which changes a few things and adds a new Netflix button that can launch the app even if the TV is sleeping. The new remote has a matte black finish and brings the volume rocker to the facia rather than the side. The keys to summon Google Assistant and Prime Video are still present. Going forward, all OnePlus TVs will ship with this new remote.
Existing users can get the new remote for free from the OnePlus Store after their serial number is verified to be from one of the earlier shipment batches. The exact process is detailed on their website if you wish to get your hands on the OnePlus TV Netflix remote.
The OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro run on a customized Android TV OS with better connectivity with smartphones. It sports a 55-inch QLED panel with a 4K resolution and starts at Rs 69,900 in India.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple TV Plus goes head to head with Netflix
(Image credit: Apple )
If the goal of Apple TV Plus was to achieve critical recognition, then it has succeeded; Apple's streaming platform has been given its first awards nomination just over a month after its launch (in November 2019). 
Billy Crudup of The Morning Show, Apple TV Plus' flagship series, has been nominated for a Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, pitting him against the likes of Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage and Tim Blake Nelson of Watchmen. 
The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carrell, and Reese Witherspoon, examines the complicated power dynamics between men and women in a bustling morning news show, amid a scandal concerning Carrell's character. 
Securing an awards nomination within weeks of launch is undoubtably impressive, but Apple TV Plus is still firmly in the shadow of Netflix, which has dominated the Critics' Choice Awards nominations list. 
In fact, 14 nominations alone are for the Martin Scorsese epic, The Irishman, with debuted on Netflix in late November.
Netflix will no doubt be hoping that The Irishman rakes in the awards over the coming months; a reported $160 million budget (much of which was spent on de-aging its cast with impressive visual effects) makes it one of the streaming platform's most expensive ventures. 
Other Netflix Critics' Choice nominees include The Crown (Best Drama Series), One Day at a Time (Best Comedy Series), and El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (Best Movie Made For Television). 
While Netflix is raking in far more nominations that Apple TV Plus, it's worth remembering that the streaming platform had to wait years before it was taken seriously by critics.
Fellow streaming newcomer Disney Plus, didn't receive any nominations for original shows like Star Wars spin-off, The Mandalorian.
That Apple has managed to do it in mere weeks is testament both to the quality of its shows, and the increasing authority of streaming platforms as content creators, as well as curators.

(Image credit: UsTwo Games) Page 1 of 10: Game of the week and the best Android racing games
There are loads of great games available for Android, but how can you pick out the gems from the dross, and amazing touchscreen experiences from botched console ports? With our lists, that’s how!
We cover the best titles on Android right now, including the finest racers, puzzlers, adventure games, arcade titles and more.
- Racing games- Adventure games- Arcade games- Endless runners- Platform games- Puzzle games- Shooting games- Sports games- Strategy games- Word games
We've tried these games out, and looked to see where the costs come in - there might be a free sticker added to some of these in the Google Play Store, but sometimes you'll need an in app purchase (IAP) to get the real benefit - so we'll make sure you know about that ahead of the download.
Check back every other week for a new game, and click through to the following pages to see the best of the best divided into the genres that best represent what people are playing right now.
Dig Dog - Treasure Hunter is a hectic arcade effort that plays out like Dig Dug or Boulder Dash in fast forward. The titular hound hunts for treasure, and must dig its way through levitating islands. Said islands are, naturally, populated by all manner of monsters, and happen to hang over spike pits.
Figuring out where the prize is, ensuring you’ve always got a route back toward the surface, and keeping baddies at bay, are all part and parcel of the pooch’s day – and it’s a hard life. Even when you master super-fast digging actions, it’s easy to miss a foe, or – after digging a little too far – find yourself rapidly heading towards the spikes.
Still, an easy mode gives you a fighting chance of getting to grips with a game that’s hugely rewarding when mastered, marrying old-school cool with modern app design.
Our favorite Android top-down, 3D and retro racers.
Repulze exists in a future beyond racers driving cars far too quickly; instead, they’re placed in experimental hovercraft that belt along at insane speeds. Track design’s traditions have also been ditched, flat courses being replaced by roller-coaster-like constructions that throw you around in stomach-churning fashion.
The game’s split into three phases. It begins with time trials that have you pass through specific colored gates, and ends with you taking on AI opponents, occasionally – and unsportingly – blowing them up with weapons.
There’s a sci-fi backstory about synthetic men and corporations, but really this one’s all about speed. At first, the twitchy controls will find you repeatedly smashing into tracksides and wondering if someone should take your hovercraft license away. But master the tracks and controls alike, and Repulze becomes an exhilarating experience as you bomb along toward the finish line.
Rush Rally 3 brings console-style rally racing to Android. For quick blasts, you can delve into single rally mode, with a co-driver bellowing in your ear; or there’s the grinding metal of rallycross, pitting you against computer cars apparently fueled by aggression. If you’re in it for the long haul, immerse yourself in a full career mode.
None of those options would matter a jot if the racing wasn’t up to much. Fortunately, it’s really good. The game looks the part, with very smart visuals and viewpoints, whether belting around a racing circuit or blazing through a forest.
The controls work well, too, providing a number of setups to accommodate a range of preferences (tilt; virtual buttons) – and skill levels. All in all, it’s enough for the game to get that coveted checkered flag.
If you're fed up with racing games paying more attention to whether the tarmac looks photorealistic rather than how much fun it should be to zoom along at insane speeds, check out Horizon Chase. This tribute to old-school arcade titles is all about the sheer joy of racing, rather than boring realism.
The visuals are vibrant, the soundtrack is jolly and cheesy, and the racing finds you constantly battling your way to the front of an aggressive pack.
If you fondly recall Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge and Top Gear, don't miss this one. (Note that Horizon Chase gives you five tracks for free. To unlock the rest, there's a single £2.29/US$2.99 IAP.)
Anyone expecting the kind of free-roaming racing from the console versions of this title are going to be miffed, but Need for Speed: Most Wanted is nonetheless one of the finest games of its kind on Android. Yes, the tracks are linear, with only the odd shortcut, but the actual racing bit is superb.
You belt along the seedy streets of a drab, gray city, trying to win events that will boost your ego and reputation alike. Wins swell your coffers, enabling you to buy new vehicles for entering special events.
The game looks gorgeous on Android and has a high-octane soundtrack to urge you onwards. But mostly, this one’s about the controls – a slick combination of responsive tilt and effortless drifting that makes everything feel closer to OutRun 2 than typically sub-optimal mobile racing fare.
The first two Riptide games had you zoom along undulating watery circuits surrounded by gleaming metal towers. Riptide GP: Renegade offers another slice of splashy futuristic racing, but this time finds you immersed in the seedy underbelly of the sport.
As with the previous games, you’re still piloting a hydrofoil, and racing involves not only going very, very fast, but also being a massive show-off at every available opportunity.
If you hit a ramp or wave that hurls you into the air, you’d best fling your ride about or do a handstand, in order to get turbo-boost on landing. Sensible racers get nothing.
The career mode finds you earning cash, upgrading your ride, and probably ignoring the slightly tiresome story bits. The racing, though, is superb – an exhilarating mix of old-school arcade thrills and modern mobile touchscreen smarts.
Mini Motor Racing is a frenetic top-down racer that finds tiny vehicles darting about claustrophobic circuits that twist and turn in a clear effort to have you repeatedly drive into walls. The cars handle more like remote control cars than real fare, meaning that races are typically tight – and easily lost if you glance away from the screen for just a moment.
There’s a ton of content here – many dozens of races set across a wide range of environments. You zoom through ruins, and scoot about beachside tracks. The AI’s sometimes a bit too aggressive, but with savvy car upgrades, and nitro boost usage when racing, you’ll be taking more than the occasional checkered flag.
Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit exists in a world where the police seem to think it’s perfectly okay to use their extremely expensive cars to ram fleeing criminals into submission. And when they’re not doing that, they belt along the streets, racing each other to (presumably) decide who pays for the day’s doughnuts.
It’s a fairly simple racer – you’re basically weaving your way through the landscape, smashing into other cars, and triggering the odd trap – but it’s exhilarating, breezy fun that echoes classic racers like Chase H.Q.
And once you’ve had your fill of being one of the nitro-happy fuzz, you can play out a career as the pursued as well, getting stuck into the kind of cop-smashing criminal antics that totally won’t be covered by your car manufacturer’s warranty.
Final Freeway 2R is a retro racing game, quite blatantly inspired by Sega’s classic OutRun. You belt along in a red car, tearing up a road where everyone’s rather suspiciously driving in the same direction. Every now and again, you hit a fork, allowing you to select your route. All the while, cheesy music blares out of your device’s speakers.
For old hands, you’ll be in a kind of gaming heaven. And arguably, this game’s better than the one that inspired it, feeling more fluid and nuanced. If you’re used to more realistic fare, give Final Freeway 2R a go – you might find yourself converted by its breezy attitude, colorful visuals, and need for truly insane speed.
Motorsport Manager Mobile 3 is a racing management game without the boring bits. Rather than sitting you in front of a glorified spreadsheet, the game is a well-balanced mix of accessibility and depth, enabling you to delve into the nitty gritty of teams, sponsors, mechanics, and even livery.
When you’re all set, you get to watch surprisingly tense and exciting top-down racing. (This being surprising because you’re largely watching numbered discs zoom around circuits.) One-off races give you a feel for things, but the real meat is starting from the bottom of the pile in the career mode, with the ultimate aim of becoming a winner.
It’s all streamlined, slick, and mobile-friendly, and a big leap on from the relatively simplistic original Motorsport Manager Mobile.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Presumably due to stock shortages
(Image credit: Intel)
Fed up of rebooted movies? Or remakes of old games? Creativity and originality are dead in contemporary culture, you say? Well we’re not sure how you’ll feel about the prospect of ancient processors rising from the silicon grave, but this is exactly what Intel has done with its latest move in the CPU arena.
Intel’s Pentium G3420 is a Haswell chip based on a 22nm process which was released back in Q3 of 2013, over six years ago now, but as Tom’s Hardware spotted, it has been resurrected and is now back on the chip giant’s roadmap.
In a product change notification document, Intel let customers know that: “Cancelling this Product Discontinuance completely per new roadmap decision and enabling the product long term once again.”
The dual-core Pentium processor, which has a base clock speed of 3.2GHz, will apparently be sold through to May 2020.
So what’s this all about then? Surely no one wants to buy an old and crusty Pentium which was first released six years ago?
Well, no, not in the consumer sphere anyway, but this chip is aimed at PC manufacturers (for use in cheap builds) and the likes of the embedded market and thin clients.
The reason it could have been brought back, as Tom’s Hardware theorizes, is perhaps to help cope with demand in such markets, given that Intel is struggling to make enough contemporary CPUs (and thus might need to fall back to an older process, to help pick up some of the slack).
We recently heard Intel apologize for these processor shortages, which have been ongoing for some time now, and are set to remain a problem.
Investing ‘record’ levels of capital to boost 14nm production throughout the course of 2019 simply hasn’t been enough, and we have previously heard that Intel has shifted to use 22nm on CPUs which are on the fringe to help deal with demand – and arguably that might be the case here.

We're still waiting for WhatsApp dark mode to arrive on our phones, but another long-awaited feature has finally arrived on Android handsets: call waiting.
As MSPowerUser explains, the new feature is so simple, you might be surprised it didn't already exist. Until now, if you were using WhatsApp to make a call and someone else tried to call you, they would hear an 'engaged' tone, but you wouldn't receive any kind of notification to tell you they were attempting to reach you.
With the new call waiting feature, you'll be able to see that someone else is trying to reach you, and accept the call if you want.
To use call waiting, simply ensure your app is updated to version 2.19.352 or later and it will be enabled automatically. You can find out which version you're using by long-pressing the app icon and scrolling down to the bottom. It may take a couple of days for the update to roll out worldwide.
Another feature arriving with this update is the long-awaited ability to stop strangers adding you to groups. This option was first discussed in April, but is only now being rolled out to Android users. 
If you enter the app's settings and select Settings > Account > Privacy > Groups, you should see three options that determine who can add you to a group. Selecting 'Nobody' will prevent anyone from adding you to a group unless you accept an invitation by private message, 'My contacts' will only allow people in your address group to add you to groups, and 'Anyone' will (you guessed it) let anybody add you to groups, including strangers.
The feature is intended to make it harder for spammers to add people to groups and bombard them with unwanted advertising or misleading information.
WhatsApp also claims to have fixed an issue that caused the app to drain battery power unusually quickly on some Android handsets. Of course, the forthcoming dark mode will also be a great way to make the app draw less juice, but there's still no word on when that will arrive. We'll keep you updated as soon as we know more.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Home Minister Amit Shah on December 9 said in Lok Sabha that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019 is not against minorities but against infiltrators.
Introducing the Bill, Mr. Shah said the Congress “divided” the country on the basis of religion that is why it was necessary to bring the Bill.
Mr. Shah said the proposed legislation is being brought on the basis of reasonable classifications provided under the Constitution and it does not violate any of its provisions.
The Bill, he said, seeks to give Indian nationality to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who are facing religious persecution there.

The Home Minister said laws were framed to give citizenship to people on several occasions in the past, including in 1971 after the creation of Bangladesh and attacks on Indians in Uganda, by using the provision of reasonable classifications.
“This bill is not even .001 per cent against minorities. It is against infiltrators,” he said.
Earlier, opposition leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Saugata Roy, N.K. Premchandran, Gaurav Gogoi, Shashi Tharoor, Asaduddin Owaisi opposed the introduction of the Bill, saying it was violative of various provisions of the Constitution, including move to grant citizenship on the basis on religion.
The Bill was introduced after a division of votes for which 293 MPs voted in favour and 82 voted against.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quarrying poses threat to hundreds of fossil tree trunks in Thiruvakkarai</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of fossil tree trunks dating back to the prehistoric period and abundantly found in Kadagampattu and villages abutting the country’s first National Fossil Wood Park in Thiruvakkarai, are turning into dust and being used for laying roads due to unbridled quarrying of red laterite soil.
Indiscriminate quarrying has changed the landscape in Kadagampattu, destroying hundreds of fossils ranging from 10 to 30 metres in length. The rock formations that preserve imprints of fossils dating back to the Meso-Proterozoic period have been pockmarked with huge craters, which stand testimony to the extent of quarrying.
M. Sonnert, a naturalist, first documented the existence of fossilised wood in Thiruvakkarai in 1781. The tree trunks were brought inland by rivers during floods and deposited in the water bodies along with sediments about 20 million years ago.
According to the Geological Survey of India, on burial due to the putrefaction processes, the organic matter was replaced with silica, retaining the original structures such as annular rings and tree trunk nodes.
“Countless fossilised tree trunks are spread over an area of about 247 acres in the villages surrounding the National Fossil Food Park. Some are 30 metres in length and 1.5 metres in diameter. Only a few were collected and lie haphazardly in the park. Many other fossilised woods have not even been brought into the park enclosure,” said Ko. Senguttuvan, coordinator of Nadunaatu Centre for History and Cultural Research.
Mr. Senguttuvan pointed out that more than eight quarries, a few of them, illegal were functioning in Kadagampattu and Thollamur villages. Instead of protecting the site, the administration has given licenses to several crushing units and the companies have been indiscriminately plundering the rock formations into chips for laying roads.
“We did a survey of the area and found that the fossilised remains have also been used on the Villupuram-Vikravandi railway line and dumped on both sides of the Villupuram-Tiruchy national highway,” he added.
According to N. Ilango, Head of the Department of Tamil, Tagore Arts College, “The fossils in the present site are being destroyed largely due to people’s ignorance and greed coupled with lack of knowledge of history. The fossils found in Thiruvakkarai provide an accurate record of the prehistoric period and it is highly unfortunate that this national treasure trove is being destroyed instead of being protected.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nagarjuna, Chiranjeevi, S S Rajamouli support the fifth Film Preservation and Restoration Workshop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Film Preservation and Restoration Workshop 2019 began in Hyderabad with a formal inauguration on Sunday evening that witnessed the presence of several A-listers from Telugu cinema. The fifth in its series of workshops conducted by Film Heritage Foundation (FHF) and the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) in collaboration with Martin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation (TFF), Adobe Inc, Tata Trust, Viacom 18 and others, the week-long workshop will have participating students learning the technicalities of film and photography restoration and preservation. The workshop is on in the vicinity of Annapurna College of Film & Media.
Filmmaker and the founder-director of FHF, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, is pleased with the response from the Telugu film industry towards the workshop, and film preservation in the larger scheme of things. He reveals that so far, film negatives of nearly 50 to 55 movies from Akkineni Nageswara Rao’s family members and Prasad Labs are being worked upon for restoration and preservation. “We have conducted the workshop in other cities before. What makes the Hyderabad workshop special is the interest shown by superstars like Akkineni Nagarjuna and Chiranjeevi; both of them came forward to attend a few sessions and understand the art of film restoration,” he says.
Shivendra reveals that Annapurna Studios is eager that all the film negatives of ANR, Nagarjuna and others be restored and preserved. The Foundation has worked on archival photographic material of Ramanaidu Studios and is in talks with other production houses and labs. “This one-week workshop is just the beginning. It’s heartening when people like (producer) Shobu Yarlagadda and director Rajamouli tell us that they want to come and know what happens in the workshop,” says Shivendra.
The applications for those who want to learn the basic or advanced preservation and restoration workshops was announced earlier this year and the chosen candidates are now being taught by the best of international faculty. Some of the faculty members who are in the city for the workshop includes photo conservationist Nora Kennedy representing Metropolitan Museum of Art, Rob Byrne of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, and David Walsh of FIAF, among many others.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nick Cannon Calls Out Kim, Hailie & Alaina On Suge Knight-Led Eminem Diss Track 'The Invitation'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles, CA – The nonstop war of words between Eminem and Nick Cannon has just elevated to yet another level.
Following Slim Shady’s latest retort towards the Power 106 radio host’s family via Fat Joe’s “Lord Above,” Cannon has fired back his own shots with his new diss record “The Invitation” — and he didn’t mince words.
“Call Kim, somebody get Hailie/And that other kid you raisin’ that ain’t even your baby (Daddy)/Took a page out of Drake book/This might get a Grammy/We going back to back ’til you respond on the family,” Cannon spewed on the track, a direct jab at his famous foe’s family members.
The Hitmaka-produced diss also features contributions from Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips and Prince Eazy, as well as an instigating intro from none other than the incarcerated former music mogul, Suge Knight, who risked getting a demerit with his vulgar phone time.
“Eminem’s a bitch,” Knight, who is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence for manslaughter, quips during the opening soundscape.
On the aforementioned record “Lord Above,” Eminem unleashed a lyrical fury in Cannon’s direction when he spit, “I know me and Mariah didn’t end on a high note/But that other dude’s whipped, that pussy got him neutered/Tryna tell him his chicks a nut ‘fore he got his jewels clipped/Almost got my caboose kicked/Fool, quit, you not gon’ do shit/I let her chop my balls off too before I lost to you, Nick.”
Cannon initially felt the insults weren’t worthy of a response but during his official reaction to the track, listeners could see the emotions brewing, hence “The Invitation” was born.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rate this post
Vivo’s vice president and general manager for the Chinese market, Liu Hong, just revealed some details about the upcoming Vivo X30 series at the Dongguan media communication meeting that took place in China today.
Liu Hong confirmed once again that Vivo’s X30 series will debut with the new Exynos 980; an “AI chip” jointly developed by Vivo and Samsung.
According to official reports, the Exynos 980 is the world ’s first mass-produced Cortex A77 architecture dual-mode 5G SoC. With more than 500 engineers employed in R&D by the Chinese phone maker. Additionally, the joint research and development time between the two companies has been of nearly 10 months; thus why the X30 series will be the first to equip the CPU.
Liu Hong also revealed that the Vivo X30 series is already being mass-produced; with a daily output close to 100,000 units. The X30 5G will be Vivo’s first dual-mode 5G phone and it will debut in the Chinese province Guilin on December 16th.
Samsung’s Exynos 980 CPU isn’t the only interesting piece of hardware we’ll find on the X30 series though. The smartphone will indeed also pack a periscope super telephoto lens, which supports up to 60x super zoom; plus we’ll find another dedicated portrait lens.
Finally, it’s worth reminding that the vivo X30 series will use a small-aperture punch-hole screen solution and will support under display fingerprint recognition. This is the first time that the X series adopts this type full-screen design, a trend that’s apparently getting more common.
Either way, in exactly a week we’ll learn more about the latest Vivo flagship; most importantly its retail price.

On December 6th, Nokia finally announced the much teased Nokia 2.3 entry-level phone. Today, the device went on pre-order in Russia with a price tag of 7990 Rubles, around $125 or 113€ at the current exchange rates.
As we can see on Nokia’s Russian official website, the Nokia 2.3 is available in all the color variants announced at lunch. Thus it’s possible to pick between Cyan Green, Sand and Charcoal. That said, the website does not show when the devices will actually be shipped. So, if you’re from Russia, you can probably wait a little longer before pre-ordering one.
Specs wise, the Nokia 2.3 comes with a 6.2-inch HD + 19: 9 screen; along with a waterdrop notch and In-Cell technology to improve the viewing experience. The smartphone is then powered by a low-end MediaTek Helio A22 CPU along with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD card).
While on the photography side, the handset features a 13MP main rear camera with LED flash and f/2.2 aperture paired with 2MP secondary camera. On the front we instead find a single 5MP front-facing camera with f/2.4 aperture.
Finally, Nokia’s 2.3 is powered by a 4000mAh capacity battery and runs Android 9.0 OTB (upgradable to Android 10).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alleged Samsung Galaxy S11 leaks in especially grainy hands-on images</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The very first hands-on image leak of the alleged Galaxy S11 has now surfaced, although you would be hard-pressed to work out just what you’re looking at given the quality of the leaked images.
Despite that, the upcoming flagship is visible even in a supposed ‘leakproof case’ due to that quite distinctive new camera layout that was showcased previously in CAD-based renders. Given the track record of leaker @IceUniverse, it’s highly likely that these grainy images are the real deal — albeit not exactly in the quality we had hoped.
It’s that interesting new camera layout that sort-of seals the deal, as there are no other devices that we know of coming with the domino rear camera layout.
It’s believed that the Galaxy S11 camera system could have some serious fire-power, with a 108-megapixel main sensor, impressive 5x zoom capabilities and may even be able to record video at a staggering 8K — thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 965 chipset. The rest of the specifications will no doubt entice, with a potential 5,000mAh battery also being added into the mix according to the same reports.
Beyond the camera array, there isn’t much else to glean from the pixelated hands-on images shared here. Along the top bezel, there appear to be some cutouts in the case, which could be for a SIM tray and some other microphones but, honestly, we’re just speculating at this point as no further details were given.
It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to expect more Galaxy S11 hands-on image leaks over the coming weeks, as is often the case, this could be the opening of Pandora’s box ahead of a deluge of new information. Given the quality, what do you hope for with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S11 in early 2020? Let us know down in the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Update: Now live] Google Opinion Rewards set to warn you when Play Store credits are expiring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Opinion Rewards app really is a great little way to receive free Play Store credits to go toward apps, games, music, and movies just for answering some simple surveys and questionnaires.
However, while the credits gifted by the Google Opinion Rewards app can be accumulated quite substantially, these credits expire one year after initially awarded. The biggest problem is that you get no formal warning of when your credit is set to disappear.
[Update 12/09]: Google is now rolling out the expiration dates for any previously earned credits within the Google Opinion Rewards app (via Android Police). The update seems to be server-side, meaning that it should be heading out over the coming days.
When you now fire up the Google Opinion Rewards app, you’ll see exactly when a specific portion of your credit is set to run out. As you’ll notice from the screenshot below, it’s nice and prominent, ensuring that you know just when you have to spend that specific allotted portion of your Play Store credit balance.
It’s also worth noting that the ‘Reward history’ section still doesn’t show individual expiry dates for your credit balance — which is still disappointing. At least it’s better than just seeing your Opinion Rewards balance dissipate without any warning.
 
According to posts on Reddit, some people have been receiving notifications to check their Opinion Rewards credit balance (via XDA-Developers). The original poster notes that they saw a quite substantial $63 disappear from their credit balance, which is especially strange, given that it would be almost impossible to earn an amount that large in just one day of answering surveys.
 
Google seems to be showing a message with a link to help center pages when you load up the Opinion Rewards app. The help center pages explain that Google is currently working on updates to help notify you when your credits are set to expire.
There is even an explanation for the major drop seen by posters over on Reddit. This appears to be because of bulk expiration of older Google Play Store credits. That still doesn’t explain why credit accumulation would reach those levels before being taken away.
You can view your current promotional credit balance within your Google Play Store wallet along with the expiration date underneath. It’s as easy as heading into the Play Store and selecting “Payment methods” from the side hamburger menu. Within the original Reddit post, several commenters are seeing the expiry date shift back when they make a purchase with their promotional balance.
Some are even stating that separately purchased gift card balances are disappearing — which is quite shocking. We’re sure that some clarification will come from Google regarding these balances in the coming days.

9 December 2019
Emboldened unions and increased strike action is disrupting the daily lives of New Zealanders as a result of this Government’s reforms to employment law, National’s Workplace Relations spokesperson Todd McClay says.
“Today, tens of thousands of Mums and Dads across Auckland are being held up in traffic trying to drop their kids off at school and get to work because negotiations with the Union representing bus drivers in Auckland have failed.
“Aucklanders are already facing high fuel taxes, no new roads, delayed promises for new public transport, and now their buses are off the roads as well.
“This is not the first time Aucklanders have been frustrated by strike action.
“Over the last two years there have been more strikes in the transport sector alone than there was under nine years of a National Government. This is down to Labour’s Union friendly employment law reforms emboldening strike action across the country.
“The number of strikes we are seeing also shows why the plan for Union-led sector agreements would fail to deliver better outcomes. These pay agreements harm the economy by imposing new and high costs on businesses.
“Evidence also points to the fact that these agreements are likely to damage opportunities for workers in New Zealand.
“We already have a slowing economy with increasing costs on Kiwi households as a result of this Government’s policy, pushing ahead with fair pay agreements will only make matters worse.
“Aucklanders today will certainly be wondering exactly what these plans mean for them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vivo V17 with 6.44-inch hole-punch display, quad cameras launched in India for ₹22,990 ($323)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vivo today introduced a new mid-range smartphone in India, called the V17. Unlike the V17 that was launched in Russia last month, the Indian variant comes with a tiny hole-punch display and has an L-shaped quad camera array on the back.
The new Vivo V17 sports a 6.44-inch E3 Super AMOLED display with a tall 20:9 aspect ratio and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. Powering Vivo's latest mid-range smartphone for the Indian market is an 11nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage.
Vivo V17's L-shaped quad camera array includes a 48MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor for portrait shots. Housed within the tiny hole-punch cutout on top of the phone's display is a 32MP selfie camera.

Keeping the lights on is a 4,500mAh battery, with support for the company's 18W Dual-Engine fast charging technology. The Vivo V17 also features an optical in-display fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the software front, it runs on Android 9.0 Pie OS with Vivo's Funtouch OS 9.2 on top.
Vivo V17 will be going on sale in India starting December 17 for ₹22,990 ($323) via major e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and the company's own e-store in Glacier Ice White and Midnight Black colors. It will also be available from major offline retailers across the country. Until December 31, Vivo is offering a 5% cashback on purchases made using HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank credit cards.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finland's Sanna Marin set to become the world’s youngest Prime Minister at 34 - but who has slipped down the list?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 34-year-old transport minister is set to become Finland’s youngest prime minister ever and its third female government leader.
Finland’s ruling Social Democratic Party council voted 32-29 to name Sanna Marin over rival Antti Lindtman to take over the government’s top post from incumbent Antti Rinne.
Having emerged as Finland’s largest party in the April election, the Social Democrats can appoint one of their own to the post of prime minister in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million.
According to Finland’s biggest newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and the Ilta-Sanomat tabloid, Ms Marin will become the world’s youngest sitting prime minister.
Ms Marin has pushed a few familiar faces down the list with her appointment.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk
Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk was elected last year and is just a year older than the new Finnish leader.
Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-Un
Kim Jong-Un stepped up to the role of leader after his father Kim Jong-Il died in 2011.
The 36-year-old was given the title of 'The Great Successor' and is only the 3rd Supreme Leader of North Korea.
President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele
Salvadorian politician Nayib Bukele came into office in early 2019, winning over half the votes.
President Bukele is only 38-years-old.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
Jacinda Ardern became New Zealand's 40th Prime Minister when she was elected in 2017 and the country's first prime minister to be pregnant in office.
The 39 year-old is currently the 5th youngest leader sitting in office.
Ms Marin has been the Social Democrats' vice chairwoman, a lawmaker since 2015 and served until this week as the minister for transport and communications.
As Finland currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency until the end of the year, politicians are likely to approve the appointment of Ms Marin and her new government quickly so she can represent Finland at the December 12-13 EU leaders’ summit in Brussels.
Mr Rinne stepped down on Tuesday after a key coalition partner, the Centre Party, withdrew its support, citing lack of trust.
Mr Rinne’s has been criticised for his leadership skills prior to a nationwide two-week strike by the state-owned postal service Posti.
The strikes spread to other industries, including the national flag carrier Finnair.
Mr Rinne’s resignation prompted the formal resignation of a coalition of the Social Democrats and the Centre Party and three junior partners: the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland.
The Social Democrats and the four other coalition parties said they are committed to the government programme agreed upon after the April election and will continue in Ms Marin’s new government.
The new government will still have a comfortable majority of 117 seats at the 200-seat Eduskunta (parliament).
The Social Democrats said they are seeking to have Mr Rinne, a former trade union leader, become the parliament’s vice speaker.
He also plans to stay on as the Social Democrats’ chairman until a party congress next summer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With no hangman in Tihar, where the death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya rape-and-murder case are lodged, the jail authorities have approached other prisons in the country to provide them with a hangman, sources said.
They said informal talks are underway with Uttar Pradesh prison authorities.
The Union Home Ministry on Friday recommended President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy plea filed by Vinay Sharma, one of the convicts facing the gallows for the rape and murder of the 23-year-old paramedic student.
A day later, Sharma withdrew his plea, saying it was sent without his consent.
Nirbhaya was gang-raped on Dec 16, 2012. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Singapore. The brutality of the rape had shocked the nation and triggered massive protests.
The Supreme Court on Dec 12, 2018, dismissed a PIL seeking direction to the Centre to execute the death penalty awarded to four convicts Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay and Akshay in the case.
Located in West Delhi, Tihar jail is the biggest prison in the country and has had high-profile inmates. Former Union minister P Chidambaram was lodged there for 106 days and was released after the Supreme Court granted him bail last week.
The 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was the last person hanged in the prison. He was hanged by a Tihar jail personnel in Feb 2013.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nirbhaya Case: Tihar Jail Says 'Have No Hangman' As Convict Asks For Mercy Plea Withdrawal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General News
Written By Suchitra Karthikeyan | Mumbai | Updated On: December 09, 2019 10:18 IST
With the recent national outrage over the Hyderabad gangrape and the Unnao rape victim attack, the demand for speedy hanging of the convicts of the Nirbhaya rape case has been rising. Amid this demand, Tihar Jail officials have reiterated that they currently do not have a hangman. Officials added that they will procure one from another state when needed.
Convict in Nirbhaya case petitions the President seeking withdrawal of mercy plea
Currently, one of the convicts in the Nirbhaya rape case - Vinay Sharma, is seeking a withdrawal of the mercy petition which was sent to the President by Union Home Ministry, saying that it wasn't signed and authorized by him. Previously, the Union Ministry and the Delhi government had recommended rejecting his mercy petition. All four convicts in the Nirbhaya case are lodged in India's biggest jail - Tihar.

Meanwhile, India's last official hangman was Nata Mallick - who executed the hanging of Dhananjay Chatterjee in 2004 at Alipur Central jail, as per reports. Reports state that while Mallick has seen over a hundred men sent to the death row, he has hanged only one - Dhannajay Chatterjee. Chatterjee who never confessed to raping and murdering a teenage girl was hanged in 2004 after his mercy petition was rejected by former president A.P.J Abdul Kalam.

Soon, one of India's few registered hangmen - Pawan Kumar applied to be Tihar's next hangman. While there have been three executions since 2011- Kumar is still waiting for his first execution. Kasab's execution which was done on November 2012, was carried out by a police constable in the Pune's Yerwada jail.

Similarly in 2013, when the 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru's mercy plea was rejected by former President Pranab Mukherjee, there was a need for a hangman. But as the government decided to conduct his hanging in secrecy, the identity of the hangman is unknown. He was hanged on 9 February 2013 at Tihar jail. Meanwhile, the same constable who hanged Ajmal Kasab was tapped to hang 1993 Bombay blast convict Yakub Memon at Nagpur Central jail on 30 July 2015.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The capital punishment to the four culprits of the heinous 2012 Delhi gangrape case has once again come under a cloud of doubt as one of the convicts is ready to file a review petition against his death sentence.
Akshay Thakur will file his review petition in Supreme Court, a few days after the home ministry recommended President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy plea filed by another accused Vinay Kumar.
The SC has already rejected a similar plea filed by Vinay Kumar, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta.
If the SC dismisses Akshay Thakur's review petition, he will have the option to file a mercy plea with the president.
Six people were convicted of brutally raping a 23-year-old paramedic student now known as Nirbhaya while she was on her way back home on December 16, 2012. Nirbhaya later died of her injuries.
The gangrape sparked a nationwide fury, which led to new legislation to deal with such heinous crimes.
The six involved were arrested and convicted. One was minor and another, Ram Singh, committed suicide in Tihar Jail during trial.

According to the ombudswoman, she maintains contacts with her Greek counterpart, Andreas Pottakis, and Vinnik's lawyer to monitor the issues related to the Russian national's detention and condition.
Vinnik was detained in Greece in July 2017 at the request of US authorities on various charges, including laundering $4 billion through bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange BTC-E, allegedly headed by him. The Russian national has denied the accusations. Russia, where he is wanted for separate fraud charges, and France also seek his extradition.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finland Addresses Sex Change Regret as Gender Reassignment Soars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over the past 15 years, the number of Finns seeking sexual reassignment has grown 20-fold. De-transitioning has been described as a physically and mentally challenging procedure with some of the effects being irreversible.
Helsinki University Hospital will conduct a study to map out the number of people who have second thoughts after undergoing gender reassignment and request a reversal amid transitioning procedures, national broadcaster Ylereported.
The idea is that the chart of de-transitioned patients will help prevent transition regrets amid an elevated demand for gender reassignment procedures. Over the past decade, the number of people seeking gender reassignment in the western world in general has spiked,  and Finland is no exception.
In Finland, gender identity clinics are run by the Tampere and Helsinki University Hospitals. Between 2003 and 2007, around 20 people a year were admitted for gender reassignment. In the past few years, though, their numbers have soared to several hundred annually. In 2018, doctors referred 400 people to these programmes, which determine the need for medical internvention.
“About half of people come in with a trans diagnosis”, Niina Puustinen of Helsinki University’s gender identity clinic told Yle.
According to deputy chief doctor Katinka Tuisku from the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS), no official records on how many people have de-transitioned are currently maintained.
Twenty-seven year-old Nita, who underwent a medical female-to-male transition, is one of those who regretted the step. By her own admission, she is not alone in having launched the de-transitioning process. She complained to Yle that her mental health issues and the roots of her body dysmorphia were not adequately addressed before the transition.
According to Nita, she approached it too lightly, somewhat like getting a tattoo. After taking the male hormone testosterone and having her breasts removed, she thought the better of it, only to discover that some effects are irreversible and that she'd become “a 27-year-old woman who sounds like a teenage boy”.
By contrast, others, such as Tanja von Knorring of the Finnish association for transgender and intersex rights (Trasek), believe that Finland's approach to gender reassignment is too strict. Von Knorring argued that Finnish doctors are “too careful”, which causes a lot of young people to feel unwell.
The results of the study will be published next year.
Earlier, a Swedish survey indicated that 2.2 percent of patients had their gender correction process undone. The estimate is based on the number of people who applied to restore their original legal gender.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA Mission Discovers Mysterious Plumes of Particles Being Ejected From Asteroid’s Surface</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The space agency said they launched the mission to study the asteroid Bennu in 2016. Samples from the celestial body would not only shed light on how planets formed and life began, but also give a better understanding of how to protect our planet from an asteroid collision.
NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission made a surprising discovery when it spotted plumes of particles coming from the surface of the asteroid Bennu. The finding is not only rare, but is the first time that scientists observed particles being ejected from the surface of an asteroid up-close. It also proves that Bennu is an active asteroid.
OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer, “met” Bennu last year and the mission has been orbiting the asteroid ever since. The discovery itself was made in January this year, but scientists presented their observations in a study just days ago, on 6 December.
According to OSIRIS-REx’s science team, the eruptions of particles occurred in different places on the asteroid. The first event was spotted in its southern hemisphere, while a second and a third originated near Bennu's equator. The particles were released from the surface, briefly orbited Bennu and then fell back or flew into space. They travelled at a speed of 3 metres per second and measured from smaller than an inch to 10 cm.
The team then examined mechanisms that could lead to these mysterious ejections. They concluded that it could be due to:
Scientists note that identifying the exact mechanism that leads to ejections of particles will be quite difficult.
Many of the particles are small enough for OSIRIX-REx to collect them and deliver to Earth and further study of these particles and samples from Bennu will help scientists better understand asteroids – their similarities and differences – as well as ways to deflect asteroids if they are set on a collision course with our planet. Bennu, which is categorised as a near-Earth object could pass our planet closer than the Moon in 2135, with even closer approaches possible in 2175 and 2195. Meanwhile, OSIRIS-REx will start collecting samples from Bennu in the summer of 2020 and is scheduled to return them to Earth in 2023.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson Takes Aim at Pro-Brexit Labour Seats Across UK in Last Push Before National Vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Polling stations across Britain will open on 12 December, with voters expected to throw their weight behind one of the listed candidates. The biggest stumbling block still surrounds how they (and their electorate) view Britain’s future in or outside the EU.
With three days to go before the national vote, the Tories are hoping to win longstanding Labour constituencies that were strictly in favour of leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum – predominantly in the Midlands and northern England, including in Humber, Sunderland etc., the BBC reported citing the party.
In a speech in Sunderland, 61 percent of which cast their votes for Brexit, the prime minister is expected to shift his focus to the way “the Labour party has let you down most of all", the edition notes, adding Johnson will most certainly attack Parliament saying it has “delayed” and “denied” Brexit.
"It's now been 1,264 days since Sunderland's roar was heard on the night of 23 June 2016", Johnson is expected to say, before proceeding to attack the Parliament:
Johnson will also set out to southwest England, targeting the pro-Lib Dem voters.
The Conservative Party says the geography of the prime minister’s business trip is indeed vast as he is intending to "visit every region in England and Wales" in the final three days before polling day on Thursday.
Johnson "will be visiting high streets, businesses, pubs and markets across England and Wales", telling voters that "the only way they can get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential" is to vote Conservative, the party added.
‘Ending Austerity’ or Ushering in Second Brexit Vote?
Labour, meanwhile, is reportedly focusing on finance-related matters, vowing to deliver an appropriate budget to "end austerity", according to the promises John McDonnell is expected to make in a speech about the party's priorities for its potential first 100 days in government.
The Lib Dems appear to be doubling down on their anti-Brexit rhetoric, as the party is expected to promise effective legislation to stop Brexit immediately after the general election. They are pledging to introduce two draft bills they say would pave the way for another EU referendum.
The first would reportedly enable the Electoral Commission to start consultations over a referendum question, while the second one would set up a referendum on the currently approved Brexit deal, with the second option of remaining in the EU.
Tax Dilemma
There is one common theme in the three parties’ agendas: they all say they would take advantage of low interest rates to take out bank loans to heavily invest in infrastructure.
Labour and the Lib Dems would also increase the corporate tax, while the Conservatives have scrapped a planned rate cut for it.
In general, Labour is planning to increase taxes on the top 5% of earners, those taking home £80,000 a year or more, while the Conservatives vow to freeze National Insurance, income tax, and VAT rates.
Brits will go to polls this Thursday, 12 December. Following the recent last pre-election debate between the two top candidates to occupy 10 Downing – Johnson and Corbyn - Pollster YouGov released a “snap poll”. The UK-based data analytics firm posed the following question: "Leaving aside your own party preferences, who do you think performed best overall in tonight’s debate?”
According to their results, Johnson came out on top during the debate, albeit with a slim margin.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amid Internet Shutdown in Jammu, Government Employee Caught Making Money Off Water Bills</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi (Sputnik): India's newly-formed union territory Jammu and Kashmir remains cut off from the world as internet, telephone, and mobile services were shut down in the area in August. The Indian government has been receiving international condemnation for the communications clampdown in the area.
An employee frm the Public Health Engineering (PHE) department in Jammu has made about $2,038,692 amid an internet shutdown in the area. The internet has been shut down in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution on 5 August, due to "security concerns".
In the absence of internet connectivity, several public utility services have been affected, forcing people to queue up at the offices of these utilities to pay for services. People could not pay their water bills online and so it was being collected in cash. The field staff of the PHE department had collected around $2,038,692 but the amount was not deposited in the treasury.
An internal investigation of the department revealed that the cashier had pocketed the money rather than depositing it in the treasury. Following this, a complaint was filed against the employee with the police. An police investigation has now been initiated into the matter, according to authorities.
Field staff had submitted the amount to cashier as a routine procedure and the cashier even gave them a receipt of submission. However, the matter came to fore when senior employees did not receive the payment of bills. 
While telephone services resumed in phases just days after the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in the valley, post-paid mobile phone calling services only resumed on 12 October and pre-paid connections as well as SMS services remain barred. Internet service is partly available to a select group of people, on request.

The creature was not afraid of people at all, and the rescue services, who arrived at the site easily picked the poor guy up and put it in a cage, so the animal could sober up a bit. It tried to fight back, however, but was simply too inebriated to do something serious.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chairman of Republicans in Israel: Trump Frustrated with Lack of Government in Israel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Only two days are left for Israel's parliament, the Knesset, to put forward a candidate that will be able to form a government. Otherwise, the Knesset will dissolve itself, prompting another general vote, the third in under a year.
Israelis are tired of the political deadlock, but they are not alone, with reports suggesting that US President Donald Trump is feeling equally frustrated with the lack of a government in Jerusalem.
But Marc Zell, the vice president of Republicans Overseas, a political organisation - created in 2013 - for US citizens living outside of the United States, says the president's frustration is not directed at any specific individual or a party but rather at the situation itself.
Trump announced his intention to introduce a peace plan that would put an end to a decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians back in February but two election campaigns in Israel - and a third just around the corner - pushed the revelation of the plan to the indefinite future.
Despite the fact that the details of the plan are yet to be announced, the initiative presupposes a US investment of $50 billion in the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for peace with Israel. It also suggests that the West Bank and Gaza will be recognised as an autonomy - not an independent Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, something that was met with praise by Israelis and antagonism by Palestinians.
According to a poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, more than 80 percent of those asked rejected the plan with only 5 percent accepting it without reservation.
That, however, didn't stop the Trump administration from continuing its efforts in pushing ahead with the plan, trying to convince Middle East leaders to express their support for the initiative.
For Zell the Palestinian reluctance to accept Trump's initiative was just another reminder that "Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity". 
But that has not always been the case. In 2011, for example, the Obama administration was pushing Prime Minister Netanyahu to sit down for talks with the Palestinians in an attempt to reach a deal but the premier rejected those efforts causing frustration in Washington.
Zell, who believes those days are gone, says Palestinians have no other option but to change their ways.
"First of all, President Trump has recognised that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is no longer central to the geo-political stability in the Middle East, and, secondly, he brought about the alignment of forces in the Middle East, creating a situation where Arab countries that had previously no relations with Israel start cooperating with the Jewish state", he concluded, expressing hope that this tendency will continue.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even though STEM programs have grown increasingly popular, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there are than 700,000 unfilled IT jobs in the U.S.
Partly that's because over 60 percent of entry-level jobs require more than 3 years of experience. The resulting "experience inflation" creates a vicious circle: New college graduates need experience in order to get hired... but without getting hired, they can't get the experience necessary to qualify.
That's a problem Talent Path is working to solve.
Talent Path hires STEM grads who are struggling to land their first gig, identifies the gaps on their resumes, and connects them with technology and IT organizations so they can gain work experience.
But they don't work for free; during the "consulting" phase grads are paid a salary by Talent Path -- and naturally, since the consulting phase is in effect a really long interview, are often hired by the tech company they are working for.
The Talent Path approach is a clever solution to a widespread problem. So I spoke with Jeff Frey, the Managing Director at Talent Path, to find out more -- and to learn how you might apply a similar approach to your business.
I've worked with staffing companies before, but they always sent resumes for people they felt were "ready." The idea of helping develop a potential candidate wasn't on the table.
For higher level positions, that makes sense. But while there is a huge client demand for entry-level talent, there is also a real shortage in terms of what employers look for.
Education only goes so far: Many bright students get bounced out of the hiring process simply because they don't have experience.
So we're in the middle: We find those individuals, hire them directly, and pay their full salary and benefits. Then their job is to learn: First we take them through our training program, then place them with a client... and then we stay in their lives for at least six months while we continue to mentor them. 
Just throwing them into the pool after some lessons, and hoping they will swim, wouldn't be such a great idea.
Mentoring is crucial. We can help them navigate workplace dynamics, develop any other skills they need... 
Companies love it, if only because it's extremely low risk: If for some reason they don't fall in love with one of our folks, they can swap them out. And if they do fall in love with the person they can hire them directly.
It's very low risk with a potentially high reward.
Explain the business model.
Sometimes the people we train are coming out of school, sometimes they're career-changers or military veterans. We pay their full salary and benefits at a competitive rate, give them a laptop, provide training... basically, we go into debt. (Laughs.)
Then, when we place them with a firm, we charge the company a bill rate that is slightly more than what we pay the individual. If the client keeps that person long enough to reach the break-even point they can hire them directly. If they hire them earlier, we calculate the difference.
In short, we're a for-profit company, but we feel a lot like a non-profit. We get to help people launch their careers, and help companies find the talent they need. 
But I suppose I could bring in a consultant; then I wouldn't -- at least in theory -- have to worry about the learning curve.
Keep in mind the average consultant often makes twice as much as an employee. And if you like that person, their agreement with their consulting firm precludes you from hiring them. 
In effect, a company can bring in two of our people for the same cost, invest in their development... and then hire them if they choose. 
Clearly it works: Over 90 percent of the companies who take in an individual later ask for at least one more. Nearly every company we work with is a "repeat buyer." 
Also keep in mind many companies aren't well equipped to deal with entry-level talent, and to help them embrace the company's culture. Our job is to find the right cultural fit, the right skills, provide the right training to bridge any gaps... that's something tech and IT organizations, especially smaller ones, may not have the skills -- or the time -- to effectively do.
Which means your training has to be both core and bespoke.
True. Fortunately we have enough client feedback, we know enough about the marketplace and trends and skills required... we know the foundational skills and attributes.
But then you have to look at what a company considers its ideal candidate: Tech skills, business acumen, soft skills, and emotional intelligence. 
All of that creates a clear line of sight from who we get, to what we do, to how we place.
Is emotional intelligence a major gap?
Emotional intelligence is huge. Sometimes that means helping people adapt to the interpersonal dynamics of a particular workplace.  And sometiems that means helping people understand their own wants and needs and how to adapt to a workplace.
I literally just had someone in my office today say, "This is my first real job, and this is what it's like..." we often provide a shoulder to cry on or a little tough love. (Laughs.)
Plenty of longitudinal studies show emotional intelligence creates better outcomes for a business. So that is definitely part of our curriculum, both for the benefit of the company and the employee. 
Unfortunately, none of that gets taught in school. So we place people in different situations so they don't just learn about it... but can experience it, too.
So if I'm a company that struggles to find entry-level employees?
Find ways to bridge the gap between what candidates can currently offer and what you need. 
That's not a new problem; it's one staffing and placement agencies constantly struggle with. Sourcing may find an amazing individual... but that person may not align on the client side.  
How do you bridge the gap between your needs and employee suitability? In most cases, those gaps won't be skills-based. Determine what is missing: presentation skills, basic leadership skills, basic business acumen... and create a training plan to provide those skills.
That way you can hire great people who possess the talent you must have -- and develop the ancillary skills they also need.
In effect, that's what you already do -- so make it a part of how you run your business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">5 Steps to Perfecting Social Media, According to an Early Employee of Twitter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the launch of my latest book, Social Media Success for Every Brand: The Five Pillars that Turn Posts into Profits, I had my publisher throw a bunch of spaghetti on my face. Surprisingly, there was a method to my madness.
After recording it, we turned the social media moment into an advertisement for the book which was then shared on social media and got folks to buy my new book. The reason that throwing around perfectly good pasta drove book sales? It has everything to do with my five step model for success on social media. (And a tiny little bit to do with people's love of pasta.)
Content is queen, and the content for effective social media marketing comes from a clear brand story. Once you figure out what your clear story is, then it's time to actually go about telling it on social media.
Think of your social media account like a bank account. The cardinal rule of bank accounts? Deposit more than you withdraw. On social media, that means you want to follow the 80-20 rule. Make sure to always spend 80 percent of your time depositing value in the form of the original or curated content you share, like articles, quotations, statistics, testimonials, direct calls to action, transitional calls to action, impactful images, selfies, videos, etc. Then, 20 percent of the time call your social media followers to action by asking them to sign up for your newsletter, buy your product, or tell a friend about your awesomeness.
The most important thing you need to know when it comes to how to post on social media is which platform to focus on. Not all platforms work for all brands, and one of the biggest mistakes people make is to spend all their time on a platform that simply doesn't work for their audience or customers.
Once you know what your priority social media platform is, then it's time to create a social media schedule and social media editorial calendar that works for your audience and your brand's bandwidth.
Your brand is not your hero, your customer is. That means that your customer (or potential customer) is your follower. Reframe your social media account to make it about them.
One great way to do that is by generating empathy, and thus engagement. My favorite tips to do so? Help someone out on social media or ask a question. And remember, don't post and ghost; great social media marketing requires real-time connection and engagement with your audience.
It doesn't matter how many times Facebook changes its algorithm, one thing will always be true: Social media companies will always reward engaged accounts with greater reach. That means that your goal should always be to focus on engaging with your existing social media tribe in order to expand the ultimate reach of your posts, and not on chasing new followers with the latest social media trick.
Here are a few ways to do this. First, craft a killer social media profile that increases your authority. Next, remember that great hashtags can put great content on steroids. When crafting a hashtag, be as general as you can without using a term people already associate with something else. Finally, remember that influencer marketing, when used wisely, can posts go further.
The real-time nature of social media means that you never know what's going to happen. Make that a good thing and learn to roll with the social media punches. If your brand makes a social media mistake, own up to it. Fast.
In terms of low hanging fruit, remember that social media gives your customers a public place to share their grievances, and sometimes they will do just that. If the comments aren't offensive, let the dialogue take place, and don't delete the negative content. Then, try to turn a negative conversation into a positive one.
And what happens if things get really bad? Take a cue from the American Red Cross, who managed to mistakenly send out a drunken tweet, and yet by handling the situation with grace, humor, and transparency, to actually raise donations in the process.
Ultimately, social media is the most ubiquitous, and least expensive marketing tool your brand has, and learning to use it well to drive sales is one of the best uses of your marketing time. Don't waste time throwing spaghetti media marketing spaghetti around with abandon, however. Get a plan for social media success.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EAST FLATBUSH, Brooklyn (WABC) -- An off-duty officer is due in court after he was arrested and charged in a deadly two-car crash in Brooklyn.
It happened early Sunday morning at East 55th and Foster Avenue in East Flatbush.
A black Mazda SUV was T-boned by a high-end Nissan GTR driven by 47-year-old off-duty NYPD Officer Rohan Shaw.
He's now charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, a speed violation and driving while ability impaired, which is a lesser charge than DWI.
The driver of the Mazda SUV took off.
A 22-year-old woman in the SIV was taken to Kings County Hospital in serious condition and another passenger, 23-year-old Joanna Dixon died.
"She does a lot of volunteer work and she's always an outgoing person," Dixon's friend said. "Outgoing personality, she's belongs to a volunteer organization, very outgoing and has a lot of potential of being career-oriented."
Friends and family left candles and flowers to remember her.
Shaw is due in court in Brooklyn later Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NTMA to borrow less next year as repayments in focus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said on Monday it plans to raise between €10 billion and €14 billion in the bond markets next year, less than in 2019, as it focuses on repaying debt as the Government forecasts a broadly balanced budget.
The agency sold €15.4 billion of long-term bonds this year, at the lower end of its full-year target of €14 billion to €18 billion.
“The NTMA’s pre-funding strategy has given us significant flexibility entering 2020,” said Frank O’Connor, the NTMA’s director of funding and debt management. “Our opening cash balance is projected to be in excess of €15 billion, which means that despite facing redemptions totalling almost €20 billion, our funding requirement is lower than in previous years.”
The biggest single bond maturity is €10.6 billion of debt that falls through in April. A further €6.5 billion falls due in October.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, whose government faces a general election next year, said last week that he is aiming to run a budget surplus over the coming years, rising to 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) or 1.7 per cent of the underlying economy by 2022.The State finances returned to a modest surplus last year for the first time since 2007.
Bond redemptions are set to fall after 2020. “This follows our programme of extending the average maturity of Irish government bonds, which has increased to close to 10 years and is now one of the longest average maturities in Europe, ” said Mr O’Connor.
The NTMA typically starts the year as one of the first European sovereigns to come out with a benchmark, multi-billion bond sale. Market observers expect the agency to follow this pattern in early January.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“We wanted to bring Wonder Woman into the modern world,” Patty Jenkins said before introducing the first trailer for Wonder Woman 1984, her new film, at CCXP, the Comic Con Experience convention in Brazil, on Sunday.
The 2017 film Wonder Woman was largely set during the first World War, but as the title superheroine, played by Gal Gadot, is immortal, she doesn’t appear to have aged in the sequel, set during the cold war. How her love interest, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) – who died, or seemed to, in the previous movie – figures in the new story remains a mystery, but he’s prominently featured in the trailer. “I promise you it’s not a gimmick,” Jenkins told fans at CCXP. “He’s integral to the story.”
The clip also focuses on a pair of new characters: Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal), a ruthless infomercial king, and Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who starts out as a friend of Wonder Woman’s alter ego, Diana Prince, but transforms into the villainous Cheetah.
Wonder Woman shows off some of her signature moves in the trailer, batting away bullets with her bracelets and throwing her golden lasso. She also shows off a new look: an all-gold suit that features a pair of wings. – New York Times
Wonder Woman 1984 is scheduled to hit cinemas on June 5th, 2020

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joshua v Ruiz does little to gloss over fight for rights in Saudi Arabia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As Saturday night spilled into Sunday morning in Saudi Arabia, something unusual happens. The shrieking bass line of House of Pain’s Jump Around starts pumping out across the Diriyah stadium, where Anthony Joshua’s heavyweight showdown against Andy Ruiz Jr is about to begin. A few people stand up. Then several more. And suddenly hundreds of men and women in traditional dress are pogoing and waving their hands in delirium.
This, to put it mildly, is not something one expects to see in a country that is a byword for patriarchy and religious extremism. But when I speak to one local, he tells me this is another sign of the dizzying change of the past two years. “Although I agree a lot of bad things are still happening, it is improving,” he says. “In 10 years’ time we won’t be living in the same place.”
The heir to the Saudi throne, Mohammad bin Salman, watches the fight on a private terrace. And afterwards Joshua takes care to thank his team, his opponent – and then, gazing upwards to Salman, gives him a fist-pump. The crown prince responds with a pump of his own.
But here is a more sober story, also from last week. A female friend from Britain wants a swim, only to be told that her hotel pool is exclusively for men, except between 7pm and 8pm. Most gyms, meanwhile, are out of bounds for women. Then there is the recent Human Rights Watch report detailing another side of Saudi Arabia, including mass arrests and detention, a crackdown on dissent and free speech and jailing of the country’s most prominent women’s rights advocates, including Loujain al-Hathloul, who called for women to be able to drive.
And that is before we get to the beheadings, or the murder by a 15-man Saudi hit squad of the prominent critic Jamal Khashoggi , who was probably drugged and asphyxiated, then dismembered and stuffed into bags last year. The winds of change are blowing in Saudi Arabia. The trick is trying to decipher in which direction.
Sport is a growing part of this, of course. Soon the Spanish Super Cup between Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Valencia will take place in Jeddah, with the clubs splitting around €40m. In February the Saudi Cup will become the world’s richest horse race with prize money of €18m. Many more events are in the pipeline.
Of course the Saudis are doing this partly to sportswash their dubious rights record. It would be foolish to suggest otherwise. But locals and foreigners working here insist it is true that the regime’s Vision 2030 plan has led to significant if modest changes, including more women doing sport, being allowed to drive and leave the country without their guardian’s permission.
True, a pungent whiff of misogyny remains. Most women still feel compelled to wear long black abaya robes or the burka in public and may train only in female-only gyms. But socially things do seem different from in 2016, when 6,000 Saudi women responded to New York Times to outline their frustrations.
The response of one 24-year-old woman was typical. “We’re not allowed to even go to the supermarket without permission or a companion, and that’s a simple thing on the huge, horrendous list of rules we have to follow,” she wrote. Another was just as blunt. “The male guardianship makes my life like a hell!! We want to hang out with our friends, go and have lunch outside. I feel hopeless.”
When it comes to other freedoms, including political expression, the voices I speak to are less optimistic. Last week when I asked the Saudi sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, about Amnesty International’s criticisms, he replied: “We don’t want to impose anything we can get a backlash from, that could reflect negatively around us. But change is happening and it will come.”
I doubt if I could have asked such a question if I was a Saudi. After all, the regime has arrested several journalists in the past month.
Another local I spoke to hoped that the lack of free speech was being used to control not only voices for democracy but powerful conservative clerics kicking up a fuss about the reforms. “Eventually they will have to create institutions that can govern apart from the royal family,” he continued, his voice carrying more hope than expectation.
For now, though, the best sport can do is shout about the issues whenever it visits countries like Saudi Arabia and China. As Human Rights Watch puts it: “Increased pressure from fans and consumers would also raise the bar for human rights.”
In January more than a dozen women drivers will take part in the Dakar Rally. Any journalist present should be questioning why Saudi women’s rights activists who fought for the right to drive in Saudi Arabia remain banned from travel, on trial or behind bars.
And when it comes to sportswashing, Human Rights Watch also has some salient advice. “Instead of using sports to rehabilitate its global image, it would be cheaper and easier for Saudi Arabia to simply undertake fundamental human rights reforms and respect the basic rights of its citizens in order to improve its image and standing in the world.”
Whatever you made of Joshua v Ruiz II coming to Diriyah, it is surely impossible to argue with that. – Guardian

    <h5 class="mb-1">Significant gender pay gap still evident at Solihull Council</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fresh figures show Solihull Council is still grappling with a sizeable gender pay gap, despite some improvement in this year's statistics.
In 2018/19, the numbers revealed that Solihull had the widest gulf of all seven West Midlands councils.
And while the figures for 2019/20 show that the average gap was shrinking based on key measures, both the median and mean are still above what the other six local authorities reported in the previous 12 months.
At a meeting this week, council officers credited a "bottom-loaded" pay increase for reducing the mean to 15.2 per cent (down 4.2) and the median to 25.1 (down 1.6).
It remains to be seen what ground Solihull has made up on its nearest neighbours, with organisations still having several months to publish the latest data.
Karen Grant, the council's head of equality and diversity, told the remuneration committee there should be "some caution" in comparing figures.
"Not in a defensive way, just in terms of the council we recognise that we have a large percentage of women," she said.
75 per cent of the workforce is women and the catering service, which is still provided in-house, is overwhelmingly female. Although Ms Grant said women were also well-represented at senior level (four out of six of the top team).
Cllr Ian Courts, leader of Solihull Council, said he was keen the organisation broke down some of the traditional perceptions about the jobs that are the best fit for different genders.
In response, Adrian Cattell, the head of human resources, said: "Our head of property services is female, two or three years ago we had chef of the year, who was a male, in our catering  service...
"So there are these examples and we do use those as part of the opportunities to attract people into those types of roles, but it is, to be perfectly honest, slow work."
The annual report highlights the difficulties that this can pose.
It said: "Evidence shows that occupational segregation, which is the concentration of men and women in different kinds of jobs, is one of the main reasons of the gender pay gap."
A legal requirement to publish gender pay gap figures was introduced for organisations with 250 or more employees in 2017.
The trade union Unison has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Benefit claimants hit out at 'patronising' £10 Christmas bonus that hasn't gone up for 40 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You'd think that everyone would love the thought of a Christmas bonus in their December pay packet.
Even benefit claimants get a little extra at this time of year.
But those receiving the annual bonus from the Department for Work and Pensions don't seem to be feeling the joy.
The DWP pays out £10 every year to those in receipt of specific benefits - find out here if you're eligible for the payment
And there are quite a few who aren't happy about it at all.
Many believe it's a paltry sum that isn't worth the effort as it hasn't kept up with inflation. One man remembers receiving the exact same amount in 1982, meaning it has not gone up for four decades.
One wrote on Twitter: "Got my £10 xmas DLA bonus 2day! Cld'nt help thinking that most wld happily give that up in exchange 4 being left in peace the rest of the yr."
Another replied, saying: "I did too. how bloody generous of them. and yes. I'd exchange it."
Paul Mcginley said: "If you have a job that pays well enough and you can cover everything you have to pay then you are extremely lucky.
"Nobody should be on a benefit level so low it barely makes a dent in what you need to just survive. Christmas bonus on my DLA was £10 on top of £185 a month."
StarlightMcKenzie commented: "I get DLA for son. Every Christmas I receive a brown envelope informing me of £10 bonus/extra. I wish they’d keep both. The effect on my stress levels of the envelope is not worth £10."
Shannon Murray wrote: "Any other DLA/PIP recipients leaping for joy with their £10 Christmas bonus? I started receiving it back in 1991. In 2019 it’s still £10, so much for inflation."
She added: "And I appreciate that for some people that £10 bonus will make a difference to their week, but it’s insane that it hasn’t risen in over 30/40 years.
Replying to Shannon, Mark Naylor said: "It would be £56.49 if it kept up with inflation. It's supposed to be a "bonus"; £56.49 would buy me a nice meal and some drinks to socialise with friends afterwards. £10 Might just buy me a pizza, medium sized, no extra toppings, when it's on promotion."
Owen Hamilton added: "Yeah I'm having a spending spree, lol!"
Mandy Altoft said: "I cranked the heating up to 25 for 3 minutes, made sure I used the whole £10!"
Andree wrote: "It must be getting to the point where it costs more than £10 to print, envelope & post the letters and to process the one-off payments."
Liz MacKenzie said: "I honestly don’t know why it’s given; feels patronising. I’d rather there were good social care services and a brilliant NHS where funds aren’t cut, cut, cut."
Rusty Shackleford chipped in: "Look on the bright side, I'm on ESA and I get diddly squat for a Christmas bonus!"
To get a Christmas Bonus you must be present or usually resident in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, any European Economic Area (EEA) country, or Switzerland during the qualifying week.
The European Economic Area consists of the EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
You must also get at least one of these benefits in the 'qualifying week - this is normally the first full week of December.
The DWP said it would not be giving a comment in response to the criticism but provided Birmingham Live with some background material.
It explained that the Christmas bonus payment was established by the Pensioners and Family Income Supplement Payments Act 1972 as a one-off payment which was repeated by the Heath government in 1973 and 1974.
It adds: "The bonus is a tax-free £10 payment made each year to claimants who receive a qualifying benefit in a qualifying week, which is the first week in December
"Qualifying benefits have an order of precedence for payment of the bonus  with the higher rated benefit attracting the payment.
"But only one payment of the bonus will be made."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reggie's Game Awards Appearance With Xbox And PlayStation Bosses Almost Didn't Happen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the highlights of last year's Game Awards was right at the very beginning of the show, as Nintendo of America's president at the time, Reggie Fils-Aimé, shared the stage with Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and ex-PlayStation boss Shawn Layden. It was a humbling display of solidarity between gaming's major rivals, something which has made its way into games themselves in the form of a rise in cross-platform play.
As it happens, though, the special moment wasn't a particularly easy one to create. The show's host and creator Geoff Keighley recently spoke with fans on Reddit, answering their questions on this year's upcoming event. He revealed that it took "months of negotiations", and that just days before the show he thought it wasn't going to happen at all.
Here's the moment in question if you need a reminder:
In the very same Reddit session, Keighley also announced that this year's show - taking place later this week - will reveal "around 10 new games". It might be worth a watch.
Do you remember this taking place last year? Would you like to see Nintendo of America's new president, Doug Bowser, take the stage this year? Tell us below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Trick Lets You Defeat Calamity Ganon With Just One Hit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We often describe The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as the game that keeps on giving, with new tricks, glitches, speedrun revelations and plenty more besides still regularly being found almost three years since the game first launched. Today, we have another one to share with you, and this one's a biggie.
As you'd expect, the game's final boss, Calamity Ganon, isn't usually the easiest of foes to take down. With one very precisely timed pull on your bow, however, that can all change.
The video below shows the trick in action; essentially, shooting an Ancient Arrow just before Ganon's cutscene begins will finish him off the moment the battle begins. Check it out (the arrow is fired at the very beginning, and Ganon suddenly falls to his doom as soon as the fight starts at around 3:20):
So why on Earth does that happen? Well, according to the video's creator, Gaming Reinvented, it would appear that bosses can take damage during cutscenes. We imagine this was completely unintentional on Nintendo's part, but characters - including Link - seem to take continuous damage during cutscenes. So that single arrow was slowly but surely taking away Ganon's health the whole time.
Here's another example, this time against Windblight Ganon. Notice how he just explodes the moment the fight begins.
That certainly makes things easier, huh?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Northumbrian Water-an energy mix that delivers for the planet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORTHUMBRIAN Water has set itself environmental objectives including zero avoidable waste by 2025 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027.
The company has already reduced operational emissions by 46% since 2009 and is working with the rest of the water industry to meet the sector’s own ambition for net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
Work to create a sustainable energy mix has already included a significant commitment to solar and wind energy, with hydro power being generated at reservoir sites, industry-leading “Power From Poo” operations and explorations of a move towards electric vehicles.
Earlier this year, Northumbrian Water signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Danish company Orsted in the first deal of its type in the UK. The 10-year deal builds upon an existing renewable energy supply agreement between the companies and will deliver approximately 100GWh per year of renewable electricity from the Race Bank offshore wind farm, amounting to 1TWh over the agreed term.
In real terms, this means Northumbrian Water will source 30% of its energy directly from the wind farm.
Power From Poo is the colloquial description of Advanced Anaerobic Digestion, a process carried out at the company’s two largest sewage treatment plants, in Howdon on Tyneside and at Bran Sands on Teesside. This involves treating the sludge at high temperature, and then feeding the sludge to bugs, this releases methane which can either be used used for sewage treatment or injected into the National Grid to be used by other people.
Any dry solids remaining from this process are inert and used as environmentally-friendly fertiliser for agriculture.
At the Bran Sands Regional Effluent Treatment Works, near Redcar, Northumbrian Water has also installed a 943-panel solar array as part of work to make the site entirely energy self-sufficient. The panels are part of a 20-year agreement with solar developer Lightsource, with the potential to deliver savings of £386,000 over 20 years.
The site also benefits from energy generated by a new £3 million hydro turbine at Grassholme Reservoir in Teesdale. The site, near Mickleton, isn’t Northumbrian Water’s first move into hydro power, as Kielder Reservoir in Northumberland – Northern Europe’s largest man made lake – is also home to two hydro electric generators. Built into the operational facilities at the reservoir’s dam, the turbines are capable of taking the natural energy from the water released into the North Tyne and turning it into enough power to illuminate a town the size of Hexham, which has a population of around 11,000.
In terms of achieving zero avoidable waste, Northumbrian Water’s Innovation Festival in 2018 and 2019, which took place at Newcastle Racecourse, were used as a testing ground for a wide range of activities. This included bans on single-use plastics, and lanyards made from recycled plastic bottles and which were unbranded, so they can be re-used for other events.
The company’s fourth Innovation Festival, in July 2020, will continue the development of these ideas and take the subject further than ever before.
Graham Southall, Group Commercial Director at Northumbrian Water, said: “We’re already the only UK water company to use 100% of its sewage sludge to produce green power, and we have an agreement in place to power all 1,858 of our sites with renewable electricity eliminating the equivalent of 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum.
“The hydroelectric plant at our Kielder Reservoir is the largest of its kind in England and one of a number of hydro turbines at our sites, and it’s within the power of our industry to embrace a mix of energy sources that can make a big difference to our environment. Our company and sector is in a really strong position – and has a responsibility to be flagbearers for a zero carbon future.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The finalists for this year's I'm a Celebrity were barely out of the jungle before rumours started about their successors in 2020.
And it was a big name who joked that he would be willing to appear in 12 months' time.
Robbie Williams teased that he hopes to bag a record appearance fee of millions to sign up for next year.
Appearing on Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show on ITV, Robbie chatted to jungle hosts Ant & Dec via video link.
The one-time X Factor judge asked: "What about the next series? Any guests lined up?"
He jokingly added: "So a really famous singer will get paid millions for going on I'm A Celeb right?"
He added: "Those bugs are so disgusting but I am going to eat them anyway to make really good prime time television."
Pushing to be invited, he added: "Boys what do you say?
"How am I looking for the next series?"
Robbie is used to slimming down and explained all about his recent weight loss - and how he has keeps the pounds off.
"When I smoke, I'm half smoke, half man," he said. "I'm a man of extremes. And the wife said, you got to give up smoking. January the 1st. And in May, that sounded like a good deal.
"And also, I didn't want to do the death, the early death. So I was like, yeah, OK. Then it got to November. And I was like, remember January the 1st?
“And I just thought, hang on, maybe I can just view this differently.
"This whole process, not only could I give up smoking, but I could be fit and healthy and have a clean head and a clean vision of how I want my future. And I found that moment to be very, very powerful."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inheritance Tax rules could be changing. Here's 10 facts you need to know...</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">INHERITANCE Tax (IHT) dates back as far as 1694, when it was a duty on probate.
It then took a number of forms, including the Estate Duty introduced in 1894, until it was named Inheritance Tax in the Finance Act of 1986. At its highest, the marginal rate of tax was a hefty 85% of estates in excess of £750,000, with the duty being limited to 80% of the value of the estate.
Originally IHT was a tax on the wealthiest estates in the UK. However, in recent years, many people’s wealth has increased through rising house prices, while the nil rate band has been frozen since 2009, which means more and more people are seeing the value of their estates exceed the nil rate band threshold. With an upcoming election, it is important to appreciate that once more the regulations regarding IHT could be about to change.
Inheritance tax rules could be about to change – again –any carefully devised wealth succession plans may need an overhaul. Without forward thinking people can find their estates are caught in the IHT net. Independent Financial Advice can help mitigate the effect of IHT on an estate.

Joelinton managed to win a host of aerial challenges against Southampton but did not come close to ending his goal drought.
He last scored in August at Spurs, but Bruce said: "It’s that confidence one with him (Joelinton).
"He’s got to learn from big Andy, to help him.
"He’s new into the Premier League and is only young, and of course a lot of things get labelled at him with the big price tag.
"I’m still convinced he will be a big asset to us.
"He’s learning, and like everyone who comes to the Premier League, he’s finding it’s not easy.
"At the moment, for Jo, it’s not easy."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Catalyst Pharmaceuticals: A Potential Double In 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
General Background
Founded in 2002, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX) specializes in obtaining treatments for rare diseases, many of which have no FDA-approved treatment options. Much of this article focuses on the current status of the company, with particular emphasis on the many catalysts for this upcoming year. There are also many references to important statements made by management during the November, 13, 2019 conference call. Overall, with the stock trading at $4.50-4.75 and with the company projected to become profitable this year, Catalyst is likely a great value play. Cantor Fitzgerald has a price target of $10-12 and SunTrust Banks have a price target of $11.
2019 Firdapse Launch and Financials
Firdapse (amifampridine), approved in November 2018, was Catalyst’s first FDA-approved product in the United States for adults with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). There are an estimated 3,000 people with LEMS in the US. To have a successful launch of Firdapse in 2019, Catalyst had to transition hundreds of patients from its FDA study to insurance-covered patients. According to Catalyst during its November 13, 2019 conference call, the “average co-pay across all patients in September stood at $1.66 per month,” which equates to less than $20 per year.
Catalyst earned $12 million in 1Q, $29 million in 2Q, $31 million in 3Q, and it is estimated that Q4 should be around $33 million. As such, the company will be earning over $100 million in 2019, making it a profitable company. According to an Oppenheimer analyst, Catalyst should report earnings of $1.04 per share for 2019.
At the current price of $4.50 with 103 million shares outstanding, Catalyst has a market cap of approximately $463 million. With the projected $100 million+ in earnings for 2019, it has a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 4.6. By comparison, many biotech companies have P/E ratios over 15, which means Catalyst stock price is low by comparison.
Firdapse Sales for LEMS in 2020
Some controversy arose earlier this year when the FDA approved Jacobus Pharmaceutical’s drug, Ruzurgi (amifampridine), for pediatric patients. Jacobus used Ruzurgi during its “compassionate use study” for LEMS. Compassionate use programs assist patients in obtaining investigational drugs that are not FDA-approved. The market became concerned that approval of Ruzurgi could potentially hurt Catalyst sales in the event physicians write off label prescriptions for adults, and the stock price declined sharply. Catalyst filed suit against the FDA because the company was promised orphan drug status with 7 years' exclusivity.
During the November 13, 2019, Catalyst conference call, management stated that there was a small group of patients that switched to Ruzurgi. However, virtually all of those patients had a prior relationship with Jacobus during its compassionate use study.
Despite the Ruzurgi approval, Catalyst's earnings thus far are only slightly less than what was originally forecasted for 2019. Management has publicly stated that Catalyst worked with hundreds of LEMS patients during the trials, so it developed a relationship with those patients, and the company is actively involved in the LEMS community. Catalyst has also publicly stated that it now contributes to 4 LEMS charitable foundations.
During the November 13, 2019 conference call, Catalyst stated that it did a 280-patient survey of its patients on Firdapse, and the patients gave a 4.8 out of 5 approval rating. The company also stated that 95% of its LEMS patients get insurance approval within 7-14 days. One can reasonably surmise that patients switching to Ruzurgi is not a formidable threat to Catalyst. The market’s concerns about Ruzurgi’s approval most likely was overblown. A new, in-development version of Firdapse, discussed below, may even give them less reason to worry.
Improved Version of Firdapse for LEMS
As part of Catalyst’s services to its patients on Firdapse, it has been working on an improved version. During the company's November 13, 2019 conference call, it stated: “Patients have requested a long acting version of Firdapse in order to eliminate the need to plan their daily activities around multiple doses of Firdapse. We are now actively developing this new product and will provide updates in the future when the product characteristics have been finalized. At this stage of the development program, candidate formulations are being developed and their drug release properties are being studied in order to optimize the long acting symptomatic treatment of LEMS.” Catalyst clearly has a very close relationship with its patients. More importantly, once the company completes this improved version of Firdapse, it should have an even greater advantage over Jacobus.
2020 Plan for Increasing Firdapse Sales in the US for LEMS
Again from the November 13, 2019 conference call, Catalyst is looking to expand its LEMS patient base in the US. The company is expected to hire 10 regional account managers in addition to 7-10 inside contract sales representatives. These new sales representative “will be targeting the roughly 9,000 neurology and neuromuscular healthcare providers that might be treating an adult LEMS patient that could benefit from Firdapse.” To further expedite the diagnosis of LEMS and offer Firdapse as a treatment option, Catalyst is now offering “a new free LEMS antibody testing program for patients suspected to have LEMS.” These free antibody test kits are being forward to neurologists and neuromuscular healthcare providers in the US. This business strategy should significantly increase its patient base.
2020 Plan for Global Sales of Firdapse for LEMS
CANADA - Catalyst announced during its November 13, 2019 conference call that its strategic priority is to “expand their commercial footprint globally.” The company went on to say that it has already filed its New Drug Submission (NDS) with Canada and has been granted a priority review. A priority review means its application should be reviewed within 6 months. The company also stated during its conference call that its commercial plan for Canada will be either to “partner with a Canadian firm or launch with an effective and efficient Catalyst team.” Based on the aforesaid, Catalyst may have approval to start selling Firdapse in Canada in 2Q 2020.
JAPAN - Catalyst announced during its November 13, 2019 conference call that it has “met with the Japanese regulatory authorities including the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, as well as the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency to discuss existing data and understand was additional data may be required to submit a new drug application for Firdapse in Japan.” The company went on to say that, “We've also recently applied for orphan drug designation, which if granted, would give us a nine-month priority review, 10 years of market exclusivity against generics and certain tax credits. We anticipate meeting with the PMDA in the first quarter of next year to hopefully finalize a plan to register Firdapse in Japan.” Furthermore, it stated, “we've been conducting market research there and as the second largest economy in the free world, we believe that Japan can be very strategic for us and offers a very promising opportunity to expand our global footprint.”
Additional Territories - The cinoabt also announced on May 30, 2019 that in addition to Japan, “upon the achievement of a certain milestone in Japan, Catalyst will have the option to expand the territory further to include most of Asian and Central and South America.”
Based on the aforesaid, Catalyst is aggressively looking to expand its global sales for LEMS.
CMS Phase 3 Study
On October 30, 2019, the company announced that its Phase 3 study for Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS) did not meet its primary endpoint.
Firdapse (amifampridine) has actually been used to treat CMS for many years, so, needless to say, not meeting top line results was a surprise. What is unusual about CMS is that there are many different sub-categories. Amifampridine was effective in treating some of the sub-categories but not all, so the Phase 3 study attempted to limit the sub-categories the best it could. Information on the CMS sub-categories can be found here.
During the November 13, 2019 conference call, Catalyst stated that there are over 50 different possible genetic defect categories in CMS. “This wide range of genetic defects produces a broad spectrum of clinical presentations of the disease and variations in response to therapy.” The company also went on to say that many of the CMS patients were children, so there understandably was concern among parents about being in a clinical study.
Despite the outcome, the company is continuing to review the data, and it is scheduled to meet with the FDA by the end of the year to discuss the results. Catalyst also said during the aforementioned conference call that “we remain encouraged by the response of some individual patients to treatment.” Given the lack of treatment options for CMS, the fact that some patients clearly showed therapeutic benefit, and the fact that Catalyst is holding off on releasing the data from the CMS study, there may be a chance that the FDA still approves Firdapse for particular sub-categories of CMS.
PHASE 3 results of Firdapse for MuSK-MG
Without a doubt, another big milestone for Catalyst will be the Phase 3 results of Firdapse for MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) expected to be released 1H2020. Firdapse (amifampridine) has been prescribed for MuSK-MG for many years despite no FDA studies being performed until now. Catalyst also has orphan drug exclusivity for MuSK-MG.
The phase 2 results of the study were overwhelmingly favorable. The report detailing those results stated: “A total of 20 patients were originally planned to be enrolled for this study between February 2016 and June 2017, but the recruitment was halted after 10 patients because there was a clear beneficial effect on muscle strength and fatigability due to one of the two treatments.” It further stated, “Despite the small number of patients, the trial reported significantly positive results as both the primary and secondary endpoints were met. This was particularly relevant from a clinical standpoint considering that all recruited patients were affected with bulbar symptoms. Overall, the side effects were minimal and there were no study withdrawals because of AEs.”
During the November 13, 2019 conference call, management also explained how MuSK-MG is much more similar to LEMS than CMS. Management specifically stated, “As described previously, the CMS trial had a lot of variability due to many genetic defects involved resulting in a very heterogeneous patient population and variation in response to treatment. However, MuSK-MG like LEMS is caused by a single antibody to a single protein in the neuromuscular junction resulting in a more homogeneous patient population which should exhibit consistency in response to treatment between patients, sites and across multiple trials.” Based on Catalyst’s representation and the very favorable Phase 2 data, it appears as though there is a very good chance the Phase 3 data meets its primary endpoints.
If MuSK-MG meets its primary endpoints, Catalyst will already have an established sales force in the US with additional sales territories potentially opening in Canada, Japan and others.
Proof of Concept Study for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Type 3
Catalyst is also performing a proof of concept study for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in Italy and Eastern Europe. Management stated during their November 13, 2019 conference call that it is evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of amifampridine and ambulatory patients diagnosed with SMA Type 3. These results are expected 1H 2020.
Additional Pipeline Products
Catalyst also stated during its November 13 conference call that “we have begun the process for assessing and evaluating external drug development programs that are late-stage as well as potential drug acquisitions that we believe may have a clear path to value creation through their impact on unmet medical needs for patients suffering from rare debilitating disease.” Based on that statement, the company may be further expanding its pipeline.
Is There A Potential For Stock Dilution?
A concern for many investors for small-cap stocks is whether there is a risk of stock dilution with an equity offering. According to Catalyst, during its November 13, 2019 conference call, “as we reported yesterday, we ended the third quarter with approximately $81.6 million in cash and investments and no funded debt. Our cash continues to build quarterly and near-term we see no need for a sale of our common stock. Further, we believe that if we have access to alternative forms of nondilutive financing such as a term loan from conventional bank lenders in the event that we source a promising acquisition or product opportunity.” Based on Catalyst’s representation, its current cash position, the fact that its cash position continues to build quarterly, and the company's access to financing, it is highly unlikely there will be stock dilution.
Catalyst's lawsuit with the FDA
A potential risk for investing in Catalyst is if the company loses its lawsuit against the FDA for approving Ruzurgi. A loss clearly wouldn't be to Catalyst’s benefit. However, objectively, what would the actual impact be? Ruzurgi would still only be approved for pediatric patients, so physicians would need to write off-label for adults. Patients would also still need to get approval from their insurance company for off-label approval.
As stated above, Catalyst is very active in the LEMS community and has a close relationship with its patients. Most of the company’s patients are already covered by insurance with only an average $20 co-pay. To date, only a very small amount of patients have switched to Ruzurgi, and those are primarily patients that had a prior relationship with Jacobus. Ruzurgi’s formula requires refrigeration whereas Catalyst’s does not. Most importantly, Catalyst is actively working on an improved Firdapse formula to provide an improved therapeutic benefit. It would be great for Catalyst to win the FDA lawsuit, however, even with the Ruzurgi approval, clearly most patients still prefer Firdapse.
Forecasted Sales
Catalyst provided revenue guidance of $135-$155 million for 2020 but further stated, “as we continue to gain more experience next year, we’ll look to tighten the range of forecast for 2020.” As stated above, the company should be generating over $100 million for sales of Firdapse for LEMS in 2019. Catalyst is currently generating over $30 million+ a quarter, so assuming its patient base remains the same, 2020 Firdapse sales for LEMS (without any increase or decrease in patients) should be $120 million. If the increased Firdapse sales force is successful with its distribution of the free LEMS antibody tests to neurologists, and the sales force can attract more patients, revenues should be significantly higher. If Firdapse gets approved in Canada (1H 2020), that approval could equate to another significant revenue stream in 2020. Depending on when the P3 results for MuSK-MG comes out, and assuming a successful study, the potential revenues from that product will most likely be Q4 2020. Assuming Japanese approval within the next 9 months, that revenue stream most likely would be realized in 2021. All in all, there is a lot of potential for Catalyst to significantly increase its revenue stream over the next year.
Summary of catalysts for the next 12 months
Summary
Although Catalyst did have some controversy earlier this year, it had a successful launch of Firdapse in the United States, transitioning it into a profitable company. The company is aggressively working on increasing sales for LEMS in both the United States and globally. It is working on improving its Firdapse formula at the request of its patients to maintain its high approval rating and to ensure Firdapse remains the preferred treatment for LEMS. The company is also working on expanding its pipeline and may have additional products for sale in the near future. At the current price, I believe Catalyst is a strong buy and has a price target of $10 within the next 12 months. This price target is a conservative estimate compared to Cantor Fitzgerald's price target of $10-12 and SunTrust Banks' price target of $11.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Originally published Dec. 2, 2019
Virtualization giant VMware (NYSE:VMW) recently announced a strong third quarter that beat estimates. Over the past few years, VMware has made several acquisitions that have now been integrated into its portfolio.
VMware's third-quarter revenues grew 12% over the year to $2.46 billion versus the Street estimate of $2.41 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, ahead of the Street's forecast of $1.41. Net income was $621 million or $1.5 per share compared with $334 million or $0.81 per share a year ago.
By segment, license revenues grew 10% over the year to $974 million and services segment grew 12.6% to $1.48 billion for the quarter. NSX license bookings were up 50%, vSAN license bookings are up over 35% and EUC license bookings once again increased over 20%. Hybrid Cloud and SaaS recurring revenue grew 40% over the year and accounted for over 13% of total revenues.
VMware reported a strong quarter across its product and solutions portfolio with six of its top 10 customers purchasing the VMware Cloud Foundation solution stack. This platform solution consists of the full software-defined data center (SDDC) stack and is offered on private clouds, public clouds as well as partner managed clouds.
For the fourth quarter, the company expects license revenue to grow 13% to $1.39 billion and total revenue to grow 13.8% to $2.95 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $2.92 billion. It expects non-GAAP EPS of $2.16, missing the analysts' forecast of $2.19 per share.
During the quarter, VMware completed its $2.1 billion acquisition of Carbon Black, a leader in cloud-native endpoint protection. Carbon Black will form the nucleus of VMware's security offerings, focusing on helping VMware customers with advanced cyber security protection and in-depth behavioral insights to help stop sophisticated attacks and accelerate response. VMware's Carbon Black Cloud, along with Dell Trusted Devices and Secureworks, is now the preferred endpoint security solution for Dell commercial customers.
For the full year, VMware expects total revenue to grow 12.5% to $10.1 billion, including the addition of Carbon Black's financials. It expects license revenue to grow 12% to $4.245 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $6.58.
During the quarter, VMware launched VMware Tanzu, a new Kubernetes portfolio of products and services focused on Kubernetes. VMware Tanzu Mission Control is a single point of control from which customers will manage all their Kubernetes clusters regardless of where they run. It also includes Project Pacific, which is a technology preview focused on transforming VMware vSphere into a Kubernetes-native platform in a future release. Tanzu is built with Kubernetes technologies from its recent acquisition of Pivotal for $2.7 billion and Heptio for $550 million.
VMware continued to execute against its multi-cloud strategy as it expanded its cloud partnerships. VMware Cloud on AWS is now available in the AWS EU (Stockholm) region, bringing the total number of available global regions in Europe to five, and globally to 17 in just over two years.
VMware announced the continuation of its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with many new technology initiatives. This includes introduction of VMware Workspace ONE for Microsoft Endpoint Manager to enable modern management for Windows 10 and Azure VMware Solutions, the addition of new cloud migration capabilities with VMware HCX and the ability to extend Azure to the branch and edge with VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud. VeloCloud was acquired in December 2017 for $449 million.
VMware's Carbon Black Cloud, along with Dell Trusted Devices and Secureworks, is now the preferred endpoint security solution for Dell commercial customers.
With the help of the recent acquisitions, VMware is building up its cloud, containers, and security portfolio to sustain its double-digit growth. Its stock is trading at $155.62 with a market capitalization of $63.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $206.80 in May this year and a 52-week low of $128.69 in August this year.

Our return from Thanksgiving break was certainly an interesting one. Right off the bat, we saw an almost 850-point drop in the Dow Jones from Black Friday until Tuesday as President Trump was quoted as saying that he saw the chances of a trade deal lessening. Markets were bailed out by a 4am anonymously sourced report that trade discussions were back on. You can't say that this market isn't interesting.
The tariff deadline is set for a week from today - December 15th. We expect it to pass without any grand gestures. The key to this game seems to be delay, tweet and delay some more. The Chinese are not inclined to make a deal. The Chinese government thinks in terms of decades and centuries - not the next news cycle and tomorrow's stock market open. As far as the Chinese are concerned, they have the view that Trump may be out in a year, so why should they help him by making a deal.
The Chinese do need to keep talks alive as they require more pork than they can get their hands on as a vicious swine fever has culled their herds. China produces half of the world's pork supply and pork is the most consumed meat in the country. Back in the 1990s when obtaining our Political Science degree, it was common knowledge that the most feared situation in the Chinese Communist party was unrest and rebellion among its immense population. The most dangerous event would be if something happened to their pig herds and the availability of pork. Empty bellies lead to rebellion. Alfred Henry Lewis, the American novelist, once said that only 9 meals separate mankind and anarchy.
The Chinese will delay and Trump will bellow. The jobs report on Friday bought Trump more time and has given him more leverage over the Chinese. The jobs report should also put the Fed at ease concerning the trade war and the economy. The Fed will, however, keep plying the market with QE4 until the second quarter of 2020. We would warn you that we would expect that an announcement of a Phase Trade One deal would negatively impact the market. Buy on the rumor(s) and sell on the news.
There was a chart making the rounds this week in reference to the Fed balance sheet and stock market performance. The chart implies, and we agree, that, as goes the balance sheet so goes the market. In the past nine weeks, the Fed's balance sheet has grown in eight of them. Of those nine weeks, only one week saw a lower stock market. I will let you guess which week was lower.
Equity valuations keep soaring and are now in the top 10% of all time rivaling the Dot Com Era of 2000-2001. That era also had the Fed stuffing money into the system ahead of Y2K which led to the expansion and bursting of the Dot Com Bubble. Why our obsession with valuations? From valuations, we can extrapolate future returns. Higher valuations imply lower future returns. Central bankers continue to push rates lower and pour money into the system pressing asset prices higher. Check out the following chart from Zero Hedge.
In the past 5 years, the S&P 500 stock index has risen over 50% and during that period operating profits for non-financial companies have declined over 15%, a drop that has always been associated with economic recessions.
Source: Bloomberg
The Fed is pushing money into the system at a rate equal to QE1 when there was a crisis at hand. Central bankers are planning on keeping the money spigot open in 2020. It should continue to push asset prices higher as long as investors don't lose confidence in the Fed. The music is playing. Dance closer to the door.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Golden Ocean Group: Very Strong Results Despite The Trade War</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
On Thursday, November 21, 2019, dry bulk shipping giant Golden Ocean Group Limited (GOGL) announced its third-quarter 2019 earnings results. At first glance, these earnings were mixed as the company beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of top-line revenues, although it did fail to meet their earnings expectations. With that said though, the earnings miss was not an especially large one. A closer look at the actual earnings report though shows something of a different story as the company showed considerable improvement compared to the second quarter as well as took some steps that will likely help to stimulate its forward growth.
As my long-time readers are no doubt well aware, it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a company's earnings report before delving into an analysis of its results. This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis. Therefore, here are the highlights from Golden Ocean Group's third quarter 2019 earnings report:
It seems certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights is likely to notice is that essentially every measure of financial performance showed improvement compared to the prior year quarter. It also saw considerable improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. We can see that quite clearly here:
Source: Golden Ocean Group
The biggest reason for this is that the market for dry bulk charters was substantially stronger in the third quarter of this year than in the second. Golden Ocean Group notes that it saw the number of single voyage charters increase significantly. As I have explained in various past articles, there are two ways that the company's customers can hire a ship - time charter and voyage charter. A time charter is exactly what it sounds like in that the customer commits to hire the ship for an extended period of time at a contractually agreed upon rate. This is often used when the customer needs to send regular cargo shipments between points and wishes to lock in a price and ensure that it has a ship available as needed. The other way that a ship can be chartered is for a single voyage. This is essentially used when the customer needs to send cargo between points on a one-time basis. These single voyages are performed at a market-based price that is set at the time that the vessel is chartered. The fact that voyages picked up during the quarter appears to indicate that global trade picked up significantly in the third quarter compared to the second. This increased activity caused the company's TCE (time charter equivalent) to increase to $19,727 per day in the most recent quarter compared to $11,629 in the second quarter.
It may come as a surprise that dry bulk shipments picked up in the third quarter when we consider that, despite many erroneous reports of a trade deal, the tensions between the United States and China were running quite high during that period. Nevertheless, the total volume of dry bulk goods shipping during the quarter reached a new record. We can see that here:
Source: Maritime Analytics, Golden Ocean Group
One of the necessary things to understand this in light of the trade tensions is that the United States and China are not the only two countries in the world involved in the trade of dry bulk goods. For example, despite the fact that its steel production growth slowed to 5.5% by the end of the third quarter, China continues to import iron ore from Australia. There is the possibility that Chinese steel production began to contract in October but the country's iron ore stockpiles are still lower than a year ago so it may keep iron ore imports at a high level as it rebuilds its stockpiles. The Chinese also increased their imports of coal to record levels in the third quarter while South Korea and Japan also increased their coal imports. Unfortunately though, the Chinese import restrictions are in effect during November and December so the country will import less during these two months. Thus, there is the very real possibility that the fourth quarter will prove to be worse for the industry than the third one was.
As might be expected, this strength in the dry bulk market had a positive impact on day rates. We can see that here:
Source: Golden Ocean Group
As we can see above, the average spot day rate for every class of ship in Golden Ocean Group's fleet was higher than in either the previous or the prior year quarters. The biggest improvement though was in Capesize (the largest type) and to a lesser extent Panamax classes. This greatly benefited Golden Ocean Group as Capesize vessels make up the overwhelming majority of its fleet. The company also has a substantial number of Panamax class vessels. We can see that here:
Source: Golden Ocean Group
The company only has a limited number of Capesize vessels on time charter agreements though so the majority of them are trading in the spot market. Thus, any improvement in spot rates for these vessels, particularly one as large as we saw this quarter, will have a significant impact on the company's revenues and cash flows. That is exactly what we saw in this quarter.
As mentioned in the highlights, Golden Ocean Group recently acquired two 2019-built 103,000 ice-class Capesize vessels. This expands the company's fleet and potentially provides it with some forward growth potential. Only one of these ships was actually delivered in the third quarter, however. This was the MV Admiral Schmidt, which was acquired in September. The second vessel, MV Vitus Bering, was delivered in October. The nice thing about this acquisition is that both of these ships came with three-year charters. Therefore, the company can have confidence that it will be receiving steady amounts of both revenue and cash flows from both of these vessels over the next few years. In addition, each of these charters has an index-linked dayrate, which could prove to be a double-edged sword. If the spot market average price for these vessels increases, then Golden Ocean Group will see its revenues from the vessels increase, but the reverse is also true and the company could very easily see its revenues go down. Regardless though, the two vessels will still produce a more reliable revenue stream than the other vessels in its fleet because they will have steady employment.
In conclusion, this was a very solid quarter for Golden Ocean Group due to the exceptionally strong market for dry bulk shipping. Unfortunately though, there may be some reasons to believe that this is as good as it is going to get, at least for the remainder of this year. The company did see a few positive developments outside of the strong market though such as the recent acquisition of two Capesize vessels with three-year time charters. Overall then, there was a lot for investors to be pleased with here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi gunman tweeted against US before naval base shooting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — The Saudi gunman who killed three people at the Pensacola naval base had apparently gone on Twitter shortly before the shooting to blast U.S. support of Israel and accuse America of being anti-Muslim, a U.S. official said Sunday as the FBI confirmed it is operating on the assumption the attack was an act of terrorism.
Investigators are also trying to establish whether the killer, 2nd Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force, acted alone or was part of a larger plot.
Alshamrani, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy during the rampage at a classroom building Friday, was undergoing flight training at Pensacola, where members of foreign militaries routinely receive instruction.
"We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," said Rachel J. Rojas, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Jacksonville.

Authorities believe the gunman made social media posts criticizing the U.S. under a user handle similar to his name, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating whether he authored the words or just posted them, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Also, investigators believe the gunman visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting and are working to determine the purpose of the trip, the official said.
All foreign students at the Pensacola base have been accounted for, no arrests have been made, and the community is under no immediate threat, Rojas said at a news conference. A Saudi commanding officer has ordered all students from the country to remain at one location at the base, authorities said.
"There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation," Rojas said. "The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation."
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the investigation was proceeding under "the presumption that this was an act of terrorism"and he called for better vetting of foreigners allowed into the U.S. for training on American bases.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon, DeSantis also said the gunman had a social media trail and a "deep-seated hatred of the United States."
He said he thought such an attack could have been prevented with better vetting.
"You have to take precautions" to protect the nation, DeSantis said.
"To have this individual be able to take out three of our sailors, to me that's unacceptable," the governor added.
Earlier in the week of the shooting, Alshamrani hosted a dinner party where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, another U.S. official told the AP on Saturday.
Alshamrani used a Glock 9 mm weapon that had been purchased legally in Florida, Rojas said. DeSantis questioned whether foreigners should continue to be allowed under federal law to buy guns in the U.S. and called it a "federal loophole."
Republican DeSantis said he supports that the Second Amendment but that it "does not apply to Saudi Arabians."
Family members and others identified the three dead as Joshua Kaleb Watson, a 23-year-old graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.
In a statement, the FBI confirmed Sunday that it had obtained base surveillance videos as well as cellphone footage taken by a bystander outside the building, and had also interviewed that person.
Rojas would not directly answer when asked whether other students knew about the attack beforehand or whether there was anything "nefarious" about the making of the video. She said that a lot of information needs to be confirmed by investigators and that she did not want to contribute to "misinformation" circulating about the case.
Rojas said federal authorities are focused on questioning the gunman's friends, classmates and other associates. "Our main goal is to confirm if he acted alone or was he part of a larger network," she said.
President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation" that the shooting looked like "terrorism or akin to terrorism." But he cautioned that the FBI was still investigating.
"Look, to me it appears to be a terrorist attack," he said. "I don't want prejudge the investigation, but it appears that this may be someone that was radicalized." O'Brien said he did not see evidence so far of a "broader plot."
The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. More than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the U.S. going through military training.
Foreigners allowed into the U.S. for military training are subject to background checks to weed out security risks.
"This has been done for many decades," Trump said on Saturday. "I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately."
Saudi Arabia's government so far has not commented on a possible motive for the shooting, nor offered any information about the promised investigation.
Meanwhile, the daily Saudi newspaper Okaz published an interview with Othman Alshamrani, a man it described as an extended family member of the shooting suspect from his hometown in the kingdom's Asir province. "This individual act does not represent us, nor his family nor his tribe," the relative said, adding that the slain man was from a family with members who have well served their nation in military posts.
Balsamo reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Lolita Baldor, Ben Fox, and Robert Burns in Washington; Jon Gambrell and Aya Batrawy in Dubai; Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida; and Tamara Lush in Tampa, Florida, contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to restore dropped words in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' quote.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!

The drink flows. Food’s everywhere. I’m salivating just thinking about it. It’s magnificent.
But… it can be too easy to go a bit too hard. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t eat that seventh turkey sandwich of the day, but maybe you could go for a little jog to help burn it off?
“Sounds good, but how can I motivate myself to do this?” I hear you ask.
Well, I’ve got a solution for you: a Fibit Versa 2 smartwatch. Oh — and would you believe it? — there’s currently $70 off this device! That means you can pick up the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch for only $130, instead of the $200 it normally costs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome to Monday, it’s the start of another week and that means it’s time for Hard Fork’s wrap-up of the weekend’s top cryptocurrency and blockchain headlines.
Take a look.
According to CNBC, the US Internal Revenue Service has released a new tax form, asking cryptocurrency traders to declare their holdings.
The IRS’ new “Schedule 1 for the 2019 tax season,” asks tax payers if they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired virtual currency by any other means over the past year.
Earlier this year, the IRS started sending letters to known cryptocurrency traders telling them to fess up about their trading habits.
In a similar move to the IRS, the government in South Korea is looking to levy taxes on citizens that trade cryptocurrency.
The Korea Times reports that the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance is exploring a revised bill to tax capital gains from cryptocurrency transactions. The bill is reportedly going to be drawn up early next year.
The that the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance confirmed that it’s exploring a revised bill to tax capital gains from cryptocurrency transactions. The bill is reportedly going to be drawn up early next year.
The latest Ethereum network update went live over the weekend. Dubbed “Istanbul,” the update was actioned at block number 9,069,000, Ethereum tweeted yesterday.
Istanbul features six major upgrades designed to improve the Ethereum network’s efficiency and operational speed. Read more about it here.
China’s central bank is reportedly going to test its digital currency in Shenzhen and Suzhou, The Block reports.
Four state-run commercial banks, in collaboration with three state-owned telecom companies, are reportedly working to find the best way to introduce the digital currency.
Earlier this year, Bank officials from the country said it had no timeline for the roll-out of its digital currency, but according to the latest report claims China’s central bank has accelerated the project in response to Facebook’s announcement of its own “cryptocurrency” Libra.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking to question messaging app Telegram’s former chief investment advisor. The SEC is asking John Hyman to testify and hand over documents about Telegram‘s suspicious token sale, writes CoinDesk.
The SEC had to ask the High Court of England and Wales to get hold of the information.
Telegram was supposed to distribute its blockchain-based token TON back in October, but has put that on hold to “maintain the status quo” until it settles the legal battle with the SEC.
Well there you have it, another weekend’s headlines caught up with. Now go get on with your week!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Abe granted brief respite as scandal-hit extraordinary Diet session draws to a close</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year’s extraordinary Diet session came to a close Monday, ending a sitting that has been wracked with problems and scandals since it started in early October.
During the course of the session two ministers resigned, a plan for reforming college English-language tests was withdrawn and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was accused of breaching election campaign laws in relation to a cherry-blossom viewing party hosted each year by the nation’s political leader.
Those scandals encouraged opposition lawmakers to boycott a number of bills, including one that included measures said to make voting in referendums easier and would have been instrumental to delivering constitutional revision.
Failure to enact the referendum bill was particularly damaging for Abe, who has long tried to promote parliamentary debate over his proposal to revise the U.S.-drafted postwar Constitution, said to formalize the legal status of the Self-Defense Forces.
In a news conference later the same day, Abe said it was “very regrettable” that the bill had not been enacted during the session, arguing that the result of the Upper House election in July had suggested a majority of voters wanted the Diet to at least promote debates over constitutional revision.
“The road to constitutional revision is not an easy one, but by all means I myself will carry out (constitutional revision),” Abe stressed, noting that “it is our political responsibility to stick to the promise we made to the people.”
“The LDP will continue to take the initiative to revise the constitution step by step,” he added.
Rather than furthering such debates, discussions during the session had come to focus on the annual budget for the official cherry-blossom viewing party, with opposition lawmakers pointing out that it had nearly doubled over the past six years to hit ¥57.28 million in fiscal 2020.
The revelation raised suspicions that Abe might have taken advantage of the state-funded prestigious event to entertain hundreds of his own supporters as well as those of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The Diet session also revealed that the guest list for this year’s party was shredded on the very day a Diet member requested its release.
Abe’s office was also reported to have organized another private, pre-event party for voters at what was suspected to be massively discounted rates, which opposition lawmakers have claimed was a possible violation of the election campaign law.
The final week of the session proved to be a tug-of-war between the opposition and the ruling bloc, with the opposition suggesting that they would submit a vote of no confidence against Abe, given the way he handled the party scandal.
Abe has, at least, seen success with the Diet’s approval of a bilateral U.S.-Japan trade agreement. While the opposition criticized the deal for giving too much ground to the United States, by lowering tariffs on U.S. agricultural products without a concrete commitment from the U.S. to lower tariffs on Japanese car exports, the bill was passed thanks to the LDP’s majority in the Diet.
The Diet session was a crucial one for Abe’s tenure as prime minister, given that only two years remain until the end of his term as LDP party leader and also his premiership.
But there were problems from the outset. Two weeks into the session, trade minister Isshu Sugawara resigned over allegations he had breached election campaign rules. Then, just a week later, Justice Minister Katsuyuki Kawai resigned, too, following a scoop by a tabloid claiming that his wife — also a politician — had broken the law by paying some of her campaign staff more than the legal limit. When asked about the two resignations, which came in such close succession, Abe acknowledged responsibility, saying that he had been the person who appointed them.
Since then, opposition lawmakers have slammed Abe for not taking any concrete action to atone for making the appointments that lead to the scandals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anthony Davis scores 50 as NBA-leading Lakers beat Timberwolves</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES – Anthony Davis had a season-high 50 points and the Los Angeles Lakers improved to a league-best 21-3 with a 142-125 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night.
Davis hit a floater with 4:39 remaining to reach 50 points for the fourth time in his career. He was 20 of 29 from the field and made all 10 of his free throws to go along with seven rebounds and six assists.
LeBron James had 32 points and 13 assists despite committing four fouls in the first half. Alex Caruso added 16 points as the Lakers won their fourth straight and improved to 10-2 at home.
Each of the Timberwolves’ starters had at least 12 points. Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins each had 19 points as Minnesota lost its fourth straight game.
Davis had 42 points through three quarters, one more than his previous single-game best this season, 41 points in his return to New Orleans on Nov. 27.
Heat 110, Bulls 105
In Miami, Tyler Herro scored 27 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 38.2 seconds left in overtime, and Miami held off Chicago to improve to 10-0 at home this season.
Herro made three 3’s in overtime and another with 7.1 seconds left in regulation just to help the Heat get into the extra session. His last 3-pointer gave Miami a three-point lead.
Jimmy Butler scored 23 points for the Heat, going 17 for 21 from the foul line. Bam Adebayo had 21 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for Miami, which also got 18 from Kendrick Nunn.
Lauri Markkanen had 13 of his team-high 22 points in the third quarter for the Bulls, who got 18 from Zach LaVine and 16 from Kris Dunn. Markkanen missed a potentially game-tying corner 3-pointer with about 1.5 seconds left in overtime.
76ers 110, Raptors 104
In Philadelphia, Tobias Harris scored 26 points and rookie Matisse Thybulle had a career-high 20 points, including a pair of free throws with 23 seconds left, to lead Philadelphia past Toronto for its 12th straight home win.
Ben Simmons had 16 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists as the Sixers remained unbeaten at home this season.
Kyle Lowry, playing in his second game after missing 11 in a row due to a broken left thumb, scored 26 points, and OG Anunoby had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. The defending champion Raptors have lost three in a row.
Joel Embiid returned from a one-game absence due to a hip injury, finishing with 10 points and eight rebounds. Embiid was benched with 2:08 remaining after committing turnovers on three straight possessions that turned a seemingly easy victory into a tight one. He had seven of Philadelphia’s 17 turnovers.
The Raptors, who trailed by as many as 20 points in the third quarter, got as close as five before Thybulle’s two free throws with 26.3 seconds left sealed the deal.
Clippers 135, Wizards 119
In Washington, Kawhi Leonard had 34 points and 11 rebounds and Los Angeles bounced back from its worst loss of the season with a win over Washington.
Paul George scored 27 points and Montrezl Harrell had nine of his 20 in the fourth quarter for the Clippers, who improved to 4-6 away from home two games into their six-game trip.
The victory came two days after Los Angeles opened the trip with a 119-91 loss at Eastern Conference-leading Milwaukee.
Washington’s bench kept the game competitive for more than three quarters. Davis Bertans tied his season-high with 25 points, including six 3-pointers. Troy Brown Jr. scored a career-high 20 points.
Bradley Beal’s 20 points were the most by a Washington starter and came off a difficult 5-for-18 shooting night.
Wizards rookie Rui Hachimura scored 17 points, including 7-for-7 shooting from the foul line. He also recorded seven rebounds and four assists in his 37 minutes on the court.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Ford cruises in giant slalom for first career World Cup win</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEAVER CREEK, COLORADO – Tommy Ford cruised across the finish line, glanced up at the scoreboard and immediately pumped his right glove.
It was simply the start of the celebration as Ford earned his first career World Cup win.
The American racer glided through the fog and the falling snow to finish the Birds of Prey giant slalom in a combined time of 2 minutes, 31.25 seconds Sunday. Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway was second, 0.80 seconds back, while fellow Norwegian Leif Kristian Nestvold-Haugen took third.
Ford found himself in new territory — leading after the first run. He didn’t show any hint of nerves before pushing out of the start gate for his final pass. He gazed down at the awaiting course for a moment, before attacking. He flowed through the gates with the home crowd urging him to the finish line.
It’s been quite a start to the season for the 30-year-old from Oregon. He finished fourth at the season-opening GS race in Soelden, Austria, in late October. That also happened to be his best finish — until Sunday.
Ford became the first U.S. racer to capture a World Cup men’s giant slalom race on home snow since Ted Ligety won in 2014.
Ligety struggled on his final run and was 11th. He tossed his poles to the snow after seeing his time.
The 35-year-old Ligety is predominantly focusing on the giant slalom this season.
“It’s been nice, just doing GS really,” said Ligety, who has captured 24 World Cup giant slalom races and has been dubbed “Mr. GS” by his rivals. “I haven’t had to balance as much of my time, as far as squeezing training for four different disciplines. It’s good just having to think only about GS. It’s a nice gear shift.”
The conditions were hardly favorable with the snow falling and fog rolling in throughout the day.
Defending Birds of Prey GS champion Stefan Luitz of Germany made a mistake in the foggy conditions and didn’t finish his first run.
“I love skiing here. But today was a really bad day for me,” Luitz said.
He won his first World Cup race in Beaver Creek last December amid some controversy. Racing at an elevation of around 10,340 feet (3,152 meters), Luitz inhaled from an oxygen tank before his winning race. The International Ski Federation later disqualified him because its rules prohibit using supplemental oxygen even though the World Anti-Doping Agency does not.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Luitz’s appeal against disqualification in March and awarded him his first World Cup win.
Luitz said he never really got the chance to celebrate his achievement. That’s why he’s eager for another.
“Not only for the victory, but there is so much around it — for my head and my skiing,” Luitz said. “That’s why I’m trying so hard to get back on top.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Climate change activists wearing gas masks blocked a central London road to demand the next government tackles “deadly levels of air pollution” in the capital.
Six Extinction Rebellion protesters dressed in hi-vis suits glued their hands to yellow breeze-blocks in the middle of Cranbourn Street, outside Leicester Square Tube station.
The demonstration, called The Air We Grieve, involved 25 cement blocks which the activists said represents the number of Londoners who die each day as a result of air pollution.
A van parked sideways next to them was emblazoned with a sign reading: “Air Pollution Kills 25 Londoners Each Day”.
Police later arrived in the street, which protesters said has “dangerously high levels of air pollution”.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: “Police are aware of a small number of protesters outside Leicester Square Underground station.
“Officers are in attendance.”
One protester, teacher Rosamund Frost, said: “We are here demanding action on illegal levels of toxic air in our communities, our schools and our streets.
“In February 2017, the European Commission issued a ‘final warning’ to the UK over illegal levels of air pollution.
“In May that year, after the Government failed to take decisive action, they were taken to Europe’s highest court, the European Court of Justice.
“The Government have neglected to tackle fatal levels of air pollution. How can we put our trust in them to address the broader climate and ecological emergency?”
Meanwhile, other Extinction Rebellion protesters were entering their fourth week on hunger strike outside political party headquarters in Westminster.
The strikers, including 76-year-old grandfather Peter Cole, have sent a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, inviting him to discuss the climate and ecological emergency with them on Monday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new Crash Bandicoot may be announced very soon, as some recent happenings suggest.
YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh spotted several influencers posting photos of a figurine from the Crash Bandicoot series they have received recently. Last year, something similar happened right before the announcement of Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, so it is very likely that an announcement related to the series is coming at The Game Awards or even earlier during this week's State of Play from Sony.
Red Dead Redemption 2 New Mod Allows Changes To Difficulty
The latest entry in the series to be released on consoles is the already mentioned Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled. The game doesn't break any new ground, but it does a great job of updating the formula.
A new Crash Bandicoot game has yet to be announced officially. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Age Year in Review: Call for leadership on the climate crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Political heavyweights at The Age have called for leadership on the climate crisis after years of failures.
Speaking at The Age Live: 2019 Year in Review on Monday night, group executive editor James Chessell said climate change was now the biggest cause for anxiety in the community.
“The political class is failing us on this issue,” Chessell said.
Senior writer Tony Wright said Australians were looking to Parliament for action after weeks of deadly bushfires in NSW and dangerous air pollution in Sydney.
“During these fires, people have been looking for leadership and haven’t found it,” Wright said.
The panel, hosted by national editor Tory Maguire, agreed that climate change had become a toxic political issue.
“We’ve seen this political wrecking ball that’s been climate change policy ... demolish all in front of it,” Chessell said.
Chief political correspondent David Crowe said every party had made mistakes on the issue, including the Greens.
“There’s scar tissue in every party over climate change,” Crowe said.
“Climate change was the issue that broke leadership in the past and could break it again.”
Strengthening the government’s climate policies could pose Prime Minister Scott Morrison “huge political risks within his own party”, Crowe said.
“[Climate change is] just so toxic within that party.”
Last week marked the 10th anniversary of the Rudd Labor government’s failed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), voted down by the Coalition and the Greens, spelling the end for then-prime minister Kevin Rudd.
His successor, Julia Gillard, went onto negotiate a price on carbon but the so-called carbon tax was quickly repealed when the Coalition formed government under Tony Abbott in 2014. In Opposition, Mr Abbott had earlier taken down Malcolm Turnbull as the Liberal leader over his deal to support Mr Rudd’s CPRS.
There are still climate denialists in government, Wright noted, and Labor lost credibility on the debate in the doomed May election by jumping between positions on coal depending on the electorate.
On Monday, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said Australia should not stop exporting coal in order to grapple with the climate crisis.
“We’ve got to consider what the actual outcome is from any proposal, and the proposal that we immediately stop exporting coal would damage our economy and would not have any environmental benefit,” Mr Albanese told The Age.
About 1000 readers packed in the Melbourne Recital Centre in Southbank for the annual Year in Review on Monday night.
Readers applauded when Chessell promised The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald would ramp up its reporting on the climate next year.
Other speakers included business journalist Adele Ferguson, crime reporter John Silvester, investigative journalist Nick McKenzie and investigations editor Michael Bachelard.

    <h5 class="mb-1">False fire cladding claims caught out by regulator's new teeth</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queensland suppliers of timber cladding and aluminium insulation who made false claims about their fire safety have been caught out by the state’s building regulator since it was granted stronger investigative powers.
The supplier of the imported European timber cladding product had claimed it was non-combustible and passed appropriate testing.
However, independent testing carried out by the Queensland Building and Construction Commission’s non-conforming building product unit found the cladding failed the required fire spread test.
The supplier has since withdrawn its fire safety claims, with the QBCC investigating further potential offences.
The details are among a number released by the QBCC three years after new laws - under which the specialist unit was established - were enacted to extend responsibility for building products further along the supply chain.
The regulator has fielded almost two complaints each week since the investigative unit was established in November 2017 - more than 300 in total.
"Before the laws were introduced the lion’s share of the blame lay at the end of the supply chain, with sub-contractors and installers carrying the burden of detecting dodgy products," QBCC commissioner Brett Bassett said in a statement Monday.
"Now, everyone in the supply chain including manufacturers, suppliers, installers and importers are responsible for ensuring building products are safe and fit for their intended purpose."
Another investigation into an aluminium wall and ceiling insulation product found it achieved a much lower fire classification than claimed. That company has since ceased supplying the product.
A garden shed sold to customers in far north Queensland that was promised could withstand winds of up to 147km/h was found to require a separate kit to make it cyclone-resistant - a detail left off the packaging.
Last year, a portable pool fence was recalled nationwide after a QBCC investigation that extended to Victoria.
Mr Bassett said subcontractors installing those products had been misled by the false claims, leading to potentially serious safety risks.
"Penalties for defective or negligent work can range from fines of thousands of dollars to a three-year ban for a first offence," he said.
Anyone with concerns about potentially non-conforming building products can lodge a complaint on the QBCC website.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jack Dikian of Mosman writes: "For those younger readers who might be wondering if, when Santa sets off from the North Pole this Christmas Eve, flying carbon-neutral will be high on his wish list, the Regional Council of Lapland has 'made vital, environmental investments in the age-old practices of reindeer herding to help control the release of harmful greenhouse gases.' Just don’t ask how."
"I have just received a Christmas card from the local funeral director," says David Tarran of Thornleigh. "This is the first time I have received a card from them. Do they know something I don’t know?"
Wrapping up the Chrimbo theme for the day, George Manojlovic of Mangerton notes that "a house up the road has one of those inflatable Santas scaling a wall. Trouble is, he's as limp as boiled spinach. Being on his own, I'd say his reindeer let him down."
In the hope that our current dry spell isn’t the beginning of the end, Manbir Singh Kohli of Pemulwuy writes: “This question has been troubling my innards in this drought. Does toilet paper have a wider water impact compared to the lowly bidet? Perhaps the collective wisdom of C8 will help enlighten me.”
"I apologise for my tardiness in submitting this comment, but I save up my Column 8s to read in one sitting, so some of them are a week or so old," explains Sue Davis of Wamberal. "I have a butcher bird (C8) in my garden who sometimes sings the first line of Old MacDonald Had a Farm. He doesn't do the 'e i e i o' though. Maybe that's just too difficult."
"The smallest inhabited island in Moreton Bay is Karragarra Island where one of Australia's first driverless buses is being trialled," advises Gregory Abbott of Macleay Island (Qld). "First report is that the bus is so friendly it stopped for a leaf and for a butterfly." Must be the sensitive type.
Now a question for those seeking change from Tim Royle of Chatswood: “I keep finding small collections of foreign coins in numerous offshore currencies as a result of both my business and personal travel. Instead of giving to an offshore organisation, I would prefer an Australian-approved charity. So I ask C8 to nominate a qualified Australian charity who will accept my load of assorted foreign coinage. My first choices would be the NSW drought or bushfire-affected areas.”

"Prime Minister is going on an official visit to Bahrain in mid-December where he will be conferred Bahrain’s highest civilian award," the publication quoted Bukhari in a report published on Saturday. Bukhari added that the premier will receive the award at a special ceremony during his visit to the Gulf nation.
According to Arab News, the award was also conferred upon Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 25, the same month that India revoked the special constitutional status of Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK).
According to diplomatic sources, Prime Minister Imran will leave for Bahrain on December 15 and will attend the Gulf nation's national day celebrations as special guest.
While in Bahrain, Prime Minister Imran will meet Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa and King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the report added.
The premier will also visit Switzerland and Malaysia. In Geneva, he is expected to address a conference on refugees.
In Malaysia, he will attend the first Kuala Lumpur Summit to discuss the ummah's problems. The summit in the Malaysian capital from December 18 to 20 is being attended by Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar in addition to host Malaysia. The event’s theme is 'The Role of Development in Achieving National Sovereignty'.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sri Lanka's cricket team arrived in Islamabad on Monday ahead of their Test series against Pakistan starting on December 11.
Test cricket is returning to Pakistan after over a decade as the Sri Lankan team plays its World Test Championship matches in the country. The first Test will start on Wednesday at Pindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi followed by a second Test at National Stadium in Karachi from December 19-23.
Sri Lankan fast bowler Suranga Lakmal will miss the two-match Test series after contracting dengue fever, Sri Lanka’s cricket board announced on Sunday. He will be replaced by Asitha Fernando, who will join the squad for the second match of the series.
Sri Lanka have also given former skipper Dinesh Chandimal a chance to fight his way back into the national team, now led by Dimuth Karunaratne.
Meanwhile, Fawad Alam was a surprise inclusion in Pakistan's 16-member squad announced on Saturday. The squad will be led by Azhar Ali.
In September, Sri Lanka's national cricket squad had arrived in Pakistan for a tour comprising three One-Day Internationals and three Twenty20 matches. Ten senior players citing security concerns had opted out of the tour.
Squads:
Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne (captain), Osh­ada Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dhan­anjaya de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella, Dilruwan Perera, Lasith Embuldeniya, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, and Lakshan Sandakan. Substitute player from the end Test: Asitha Fernando.
Pakistan: Azhar Ali (captain), Fawad Alam, Mohammad Rizwan (wicket keeper), Babar Azam, Abid Ali, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Imam-ul-Haq, Imran Khan, Kashif Bhatti, Mohammad Abbas, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shan Masood, Yasir Shah, and Usman Shinwari.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why I'm a libertarian defeatist about Medicare-for-all</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first time I heard the phrase "Medicare-for-all," I thought, "Oh, so that's how it happens. That's how America gets single-payer health care."
I'm not excited at the prospect. But I am resigned to its inevitability and unenthused about the realistic alternatives. I'm a libertarian health-care defeatist.
My reasoning here is pretty simple: As Americans from across the political spectrum agree, our present health insurance system sucks. Compared to similar countries, we pay more for worse outcomes — and the complexity! Heaven forbid anyone ever get a straightforward answer on what a procedure costs. The whole thing is intolerably expensive and convoluted.
Moreover, U.S. health care hasn't been in striking distance of a free market for decades, and the obstacles to getting there seem insurmountable. So if the principle of the thing is already irreparable, and I'm pretty sure it is, we may as well simplify. And Medicare-for-all — at once familiar and radical and sneakily difficult to argue against if you aren't also calling for an end to Medicare proper, which neither major party is — just might be the marketing that sells it. I'd be surprised if the United States didn't have some sort of universal, state-provided health care, maybe under the Medicare brand, within about 10 years.
A bit of history may here be in order. Contrary the suggestion of GOP apoplecticism c. 2010, ObamaCare was hardly the introduction of state meddling in the health-care market. Before the Affordable Care Act, the Cato Institute's Michael Tanner notes atNational Review, "[n]early all health care was subsidized in some way, either directly or indirectly." The government already "directly paid for more than half of all health-care spending," and the "third-party and even fourth-party payment mechanism[s]," which paid 87 cents of every health-care dollar, "insulated consumers from the cost of their health-care choices and drove up both spending and prices." Meanwhile, Tanner continues, "provider cartels, both insurers and medical professionals, used regulatory and licensing barriers to protect themselves from competition and inflate prices."
Two state interventions in the health-care market deserve special attention. One is employer-provided health insurance, a strange arrangement that exists because of a federal wage freeze during World War II. Employers seeking to offer more attractive compensation packages provided insurance instead of a raise. This workaround made sense given the regulations businesses then faced, but it seems unlikely we would have thus widely linked jobs and health care without the artificial incentive. The unfortunate result is health insurance can disappear when you need it most and the costs of routine care are warped and hidden from patients.
The second intervention is Medicare itself, which has produced dramatic price increases and distortions of care decisions. If the growth rate of health spending had remained consistent with the rest of the economy from the time Medicare was introduced to today, Americans now would spend around $220 billion annually, according to calculations from Georgetown Law's David A. Hyman and Charles Silver of the University of Texas. Instead, we spend around $3.4 trillion — a boggling spike even allowing for the correction of under-treatment and the introduction of new treatment options — and as much as $1 trillion of that goes to waste, fraud, and abuse. Furthermore, Hyman and Silver explain, providers' determination to extract every penny they can from Medicare sometimes results in the indefensible subjection of sick and dying people to tests and treatment they do not need.
Surely we can do better than this — but how? My ideal health-care system is probably about what you'd expect from a libertarian. I'll sketch it in three broad points.
First, I'd like routine care to operate more like chiropractors, massage therapists, vets, and some dentists, who offer clear pricing information that makes it easy to comparison shop.
Second, I think insurance should be an independent purchase, not an employment-linked benefit; that it should operate in a national, not state-constricted, market; and that it should function more like auto insurance, applying to catastrophic situations (major illnesses requiring extensive treatment and emergencies where there's no time for shopping around) rather than routine care. These changes make the first point doable.
Third, because I am not a Randian monster without a functioning conscience, I think there must be a robust charitable safety net to ensure everyone gets the care they need. Some of this would take the form of traditional giving, and it could also involve arrangements like that of the doula collective I hired while pregnant, where patients pay on an income-based sliding scale so the service is available to all.
But I don't expect anything like that in the foreseeable future. I wouldn't even place it in the "unlikely and difficult, but you have to hold out hope" category where I'd put major foreign policy reform. This just isn't going to happen. There are far too many powerful interests opposing it, and it is increasingly distant from what most Americans want.
That's not to say the average American is thrilled with the nuts and bolts of Medicare-for-all. Polling shows support plummets well below 50 percent when respondents are informed the program could entail ending private insurance, raising taxes, and limiting or delaying care options. I expect most or all of such negative predictions would prove true, and Medicare-for-all, though in some ways better than the present system, would be far from the panacea its supporters describe. The serious problems facing Medicare as it exists now, including insolvency and issues of pricing and care choices described above, will not be lessened by its expansion. But such details are not the focus of the pitch, which offers an attractively simple alternative to our current plight and, crucially, does so by expanding an existing program few meaningfully oppose.
Wouldn't it be nice to eliminate all this mess of enrollment periods and monthly premiums and switching insurance with every new job and figuring out if the doctor you want to see is in your network? Wouldn't it be nice to just go get treatment when you need it? And if you don't object to Medicare for the elderly, why would you object to it for everyone else? That's the immediately intelligible case for Medicare-for-all or something like it, and when proposed without details on its costs and drawbacks, it has the support of around seven in 10 Americans. If private insurance is not shut down, a federal insurance plan even gets the backing of five in 10 Republicans.
Almost no one likes the insurance system we have now, and the Overton Window on this is shifting rapidly. A mandate for Medicare-for-all may not come from this election, but I don't expect we'll close another decade without it.
It's a fact libertarians like me must face.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Even Attorney General Barr is reportedly warning Trump to dump Rudy Giuliani</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rudy Giuliani's late-career taste for wealth led him to lucrative foreign consulting work, and those business ties apparently prevented him from becoming secretary of state after he helped get his old friend Donald Trump elected president in 2016, The Washington Post and The New York Times recount. But Giuliani joined the president as an unpaid personal attorney in 2018, the Times adds, and since then, "step by step, he has escorted President Trump to the brink of impeachment."
Without Giuliani's "push for money and frank yearning for relevance, the Trump Ukrainian initiative might never have amounted to much more than presidential tweetstorms," and Trump wouldn't be weeks from impeachment, the Times reports. Yet Giuliani was back in Ukraine last week, still publicly digging for (or trying to will into being) dirt on Democrats. Trump seems on board, but his staunchest allies aren't sure what to make of it.
"It's weird that he's over there," Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) told ABC News This Week on Sunday. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) suggested on CNN that Giuliani "is the president's personal attorney, but I don't know that he's over there on the president's direction. In fact, I would suggest that he's not." Several times "in recent months", Attorney General William Barr "has counseled Trump in general terms that Giuliani has become a liability and a problem for the administration," the Post reports, and at least once he personally "warned the president that he was not being well-served by his lawyer."
In fact, the Post continues, Giuliani's actions have long "caused persistent alarm among Trump's advisers, who worry that it is often not clear who Giuliani is representing — the president, his private clients, or his own foreign policy views — in his meetings at the White House and in foreign cities." Giuliani's "uniquely powerful position" as "unpaid personal counsel to the president and for-profit peddler of access and advice" has led not only to the Ukraine scandal, the Times reports, but also to a wide-ranging criminal investigation by the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office Giuliani used to lead.
The Justice Department, White House, and Giuliani did not respond to the Post's request for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rival manager heaps praise on Bristol Rovers after Southend United comeback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wycombe Wanderers boss Gareth Ainsworth has heaped praise on Bristol Rovers after their comeback against Southend this weekend.
The Gas were 2-0 down at half time on Saturday, but second half goals from Jonson Clarke-Harris, Abu Ogogo, Ed Upson and Alfie Kilgour secured the three points.
Graham Coughlan's side have only lost once at the Mem so far this season, and it is this home form which Ainsworth pointed out for praise.
Speaking on the EFL on Quest highlights show, the Chairboys boss said: "It's a tough place to go, a really tough place to go.
"They are making the most of teams going there and struggling.
"With Southend going 2-0 up, they (the Gas) must have thought that they always have a chance.
"With Clarke-Harris on form as always, it was a great result for them."
Wycombe laboured to a 0-0 draw against Rovers when they visited the Mem in August, with the only loss at home coming against Bolton in October.
Rovers have won five and drawn three of their other 8 games at home, and will look to continue that home form as they aim to stay in the play off spots.
Rovers now find themselves in fifth place, and after the game Gas boss Graham Coughlan issued a challenge to his players to stay in the top six.
He said: "Staying there is the challenge.
"Staying in and around that area is a mighty, mighty challenge and I even asked the players if they’ve got it within them to meet that challenge, I would say to them if you turn up like that too often (like they did in the first half) you’ll get punished, you won’t be able to do that too often.
"We have been here before, we were fourth in the division and didn’t maintain it, we’re fifth in the division tonight, my challenge to the lads is to maintain that."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ted Odogwu, Kano
Kano State governor, Dr  Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday appointed Emir Mohammed Sanusi, as the pioneer Chairman of the new State Council of Emirs for a period of two years.
The announcement, which came as a surprise has finally put to rest speculations as to who Governor Ganduje will appoint as the Chairman of the Emirate Council.
Ganduje had in a recent TV interview said that he would soon appoint a chairman for the State Council of Emirs.
During the interview, Ganduje, pointed out that the law empowers him to appoint, who becomes the chairman of the State Council of Emirs.
In a statement by Abba Anwar, his Chief Press Secretary, Ganduje restated that the reason behind the creation of four additional emirates headed by first-class emirs, was that they were in existence in the past.
He added that it was the people, who yearned for it, so as to facilitate and fast track the socio-economic development of their respective communities.
”There was a similar demand, during the reign of the late former governor of the old Kano State, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar Rimi, recalling that, at that time, the process for the creation of the then new emirates did not comply, with the provisions of the Constitution.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja
The Presidency has said that millions of Nigerians are not bothered about the rearrest of SaharaReporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore, at the Federal High Court in Abuja last Friday.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said this during Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme on Monday.
Adesina was asked to react to the outrage that greeted the violent rearrest of Sowore.
He said the Presidency stands by the claim of the State Security Service that the video circulating did not reflect what actually transpired in court.
The President’s spokesman added, “I don’t particularly agree with you when you say a lot of Nigerians (are not happy), you know that all this noise has been coming from less than 100,000 Nigerians. And the noise will be so loud that you think it is the whole country.
“It is a country of 198 million people. When just 100,000 are making noise in the social and traditional media, you would think the whole country is in an uproar. There are millions and millions of people who are not bothered.
“There are millions of people who know what the issues are. So, you cannot just seek the opinion of a local minority and then conclude that the country is in an uproar.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chima Azubuike, Gombe
The Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism has postponed the presentation of the award to Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo.
According to a statement signed by Motunrayo Alaka, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre, the decision was reached following the rearrest of Omoleye Sowore, Publisher of SaharaReporters, on Friday, by operatives of the Department of State Services.
Alaka said, “The postponement was decided on, to align with protests against the repression of freedom of speech in recent times especially the incident between the Department of State Security (DSS) and Omoleye Sowore, Publisher of Sahara Reporters, on Friday 6 December. The Vice President himself shares this awareness and the inappropriateness of the award at this point.”
The WSCIJ holds the award presentation event on December 9, the World Anti-Corruption Day and eve of the World Human Rights Day to highlight the importance of investigative reporting as a tool for accountability, good governance and social justice in a democracy.
WSCIJ had earlier announced that it would present an ‘Integrity speciality of the anti-corruption defender award’ to the vice-president for his “invaluable work of overhauling the Lagos State Judiciary, facilitating far-reaching reforms in the administration of justice in the state, his work of promoting integrity in the civil society and business in Nigeria and his consistency as a strong voice for promoting integrity in the country.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">1 / 3The candidate for the next Prime Minister of Finland, Sanna Marin, smiles after she won the SDP's Prime Minister candidate vote against Antti Lindtman, in Helsinki, Finland, Sunday, Dec. 8, 2019.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Finland's next government is breaking the mold in multiple ways.
Sanna Marin, the 34-year-old transport minister, was tapped over the weekend by the ruling Social Democratic Party to be Finland's new prime minister. When she takes the reins of the country, most likely on Tuesday, she will become the world’s youngest sitting head of government.
In another unusual development, Marin will head a coalition with four other parties that are all led by women — three of whom are in their early 30s. Her own biography also breaks the mold: Raised by a single mother, she has described feeling discriminated against in Finland when her mother was in a relationship with another woman.
Elina Penttinen, a lecturer in gender studies at the University of Helsinski, said the rise of so many women is “exceptional” not only by the standards of the wider world, where older men hold most power, but even by the standards of Finland, which regularly ranks as one of the best countries in the world for gender equality.
“Here it seems pretty amazing, too,” she said.
The Social Democrats emerged as the strongest party after Finland's election in April. Antti Rinne, the incumbent prime minister whom Marin is replacing, stepped down last week amid political turmoil caused by a strike of postal workers. Rinne says he plans to continue as the Social Democrats' leader until a party congress next summer.
Penttinen described Marin as a talented politician known for her leadership skills whose progressive program stresses combating climate change, protecting the country's famous social protections like health care and reaching out to young people.
Finland, like much of the West, has seen a rise in right-wing populists and the nationalist Finns Party did well in April election, though centrist and left-wing parties won most votes and together could govern in the multi-party coalition.
“I hope it’s a sign of more change to come against populists, especially in the age of Trump and populism," Penttinen said.
A tweet by a journalist for Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat with photos of the quintet drew attention online by visually underscoring the idea of rising female power in politics.
Marin will become the youngest-serving leader of a government in the world, beating out Ukraine's 35-year-old prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk. She might not hold that title for long, however. Sebastian Kurz, the 33-year-old former Austrian chancellor who rose to that position when he was 31, won an election in September and is in talks to form a new governing coalition that would put him back in the job.
Marin joins a small group of female leaders who have sought to counteract the rise of populism. That group includes Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova, 46, a progressive whose election this year bucked the trend of populism and nationalism in Central Europe.
And like New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern — who is 39 — Marin is a new mother, having given birth to a daughter last year.
A lawmaker since 2015, Marin is the party's vice chairwoman and was minister for transport and communications in the outgoing government.
Lawmakers are likely to approve the new government this week so Marin can represent Finland at a summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Finland holds the EU's rotating presidency until the end of the year.
Beside Marin, the coalition's other party leaders are 32-year-old Katri Kulmuni of the Center Party; the Left Alliance's Li Andersson, 32; Maria Ohisalo, the 34-year-old leader of the Greens; and the head of the Swedish People’s Party, Anna-Maja Henriksson, who at 55 is the oldest.
The coalition will have a comfortable majority of 117 seats in the 200-seat Eduskunta, or Parliament.
The Center Party announced Monday that Kulmuni will be the finance minister in the new government.
Marin will be Finland's third female government leader. Women have been present in politics in the Nordic region for decades and today represent half of the party leaders in Sweden. Four of Denmark's nine parties are headed by women.
Mette Frederiksen became Denmark's prime minister in June, while Erna Solberg has been Norway's head of government since 2013.
Iceland's Vigdis Finnbogadottir was the first woman to be democratically elected as head of state by voters when she defeated three men for the presidency in 1980.

This story has been corrected to show that Marin is not party leader for the Social Democrats.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran is ready for more prisoner swaps with the United States, the Cabinet spokesman said Monday even as he reiterated the Iranian leadership's stance that there will be no other negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
The remarks by the spokesman, Ali Rabiei, were the first after a prisoner exchange over the weekend saw Iran free a Chinese-American scholar from Princeton who had been held for three years on widely criticized espionage charges.
The scholar, graduate student Xiyue Wang, was freed in exchange for Iranian scientist Massoud Soleimani who had faced a federal trial in Georgia over charges he violated sanctions by trying to have biological material brought to Iran.
“We are ready to cooperate to return all Iranians unlawfully imprisoned in the U.S.,” Rabiei told reporters at a briefing in Tehran. He said however that there will be no other negotiations with the U.S. beside this issue.
Rabiei said any further negotiations would be possible through the so-called 5+1 framework — a reference to the five permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany — under the condition that the U.S. first lift sanctions on Iran.
“The ball is in the US’ court,” said Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in a tweet later Monday. He said Iran was “fully ready for comprehensive prisoner exchange,” while attending a regional conference in Istanbul, Turkey.
Saturday's exchange was negotiated indirectly and took place in Switzerland, which looks after U.S. interests in Iran as Tehran and Washington have no diplomatic ties. The swap raised hopes of other similar actions and was seen as a rare diplomatic breakthrough between Tehran and Washington after months of tensions. But it was unclear if it would have any effect on Iranian-U.S. relations.
Crushing U.S. sanctions on Iran blocking it from selling crude oil abroad remain in place, part of President Donald Trump's maximum pressure campaign imposed following his unilateral withdraw from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year. Those sanctions in part fueled the anger seen in nationwide protests last month that Iranian security forces violently put down.
Amnesty International says that over 200 people were killed in the crackdown though Iran has offered no death toll or any other figures related to the unrest.
In a speech in parliament Monday, pro-reform Iranian lawmaker Parvaneh Salahshouri said the authorities should not have used force to serve their own interests, referring to the November protests.
“We have to find opportunities before it's too late. How can I tolerate the killing of young people as a member of parliament, and then seek re-election to represent the people?” she said. She also alleged authorities were out of touch with a changing Iranian society.
Iran’s currency, the rial, lost some 5% of its value against U.S. dollar Monday. In the Iranian capital, money exchange shops offered 135,000 rials for one U.S. dollar, having traded Sunday at about 128,000 to the dollar.
There remain other Western detainees from the U.S. and elsewhere who are held in Iran and who could be used as bargaining chips for future negotiations.
They include U.S. Navy veteran Michael White, who is serving a 10-year espionage sentence, as well as environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, an Iranian with U.S. and British citizenship also initially sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Also in Iran are 83-year-old Baquer Namazi and his son, Siamak Namazi, dual Iranian-American nationals facing 10-year sentences after they were convicted of collaborating with a hostile power. Baquer Namazi now is on a prison furlough. However, the Namazis say he remains unable to leave Iran.
Former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran in 2007 while on an unauthorized CIA mission, remains missing as well. Iran says that Levinson is not in the country and that it has no further information about him, but his family holds Tehran responsible for his disappearance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BofA Director Charged in Hong Kong After Scuffle With Police</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) -- A Bank of America Corp. anti-bribery and compliance director in Hong Kong was charged with assaulting a police officer after an altercation in a metro station over the weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The director, a 35-year-old American, was released on HK$10,000 ($1,300) bail and faces another hearing on Feb. 4, Oriental Daily and other media reported. Bank of America spokesman Mark Tsang declined to comment. Hong Kong police confirmed they had arrested a 35-year-old foreigner for obstructing and assaulting an officer seeking to stop a turnstile jumper.
The BofA employee is the latest Hong Kong banking professional to become entangled in the turmoil that has roiled the financial hub over the past six months. A Citigroup Inc. banker was detained last month after a scuffle with police, while BNP Paribas SA in September issued a public apology over pro-protest social media posts by one of its employees.
The turbulence has made office life tense in Hong Kong with firms across the city urging workers to prioritize their safety. The violence of the protests has subsided recently. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of marchers walked through central Hong Kong, in a largely peaceful gathering calling for greater freedom and democracy.
At a press conference on Monday, police said they made 42 protest-related arrests during the weekend, bringing the total to more than 6,000 since June. Police have fired 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 bean bag rounds and 1,850 sponge grenades over the past six months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ramaphosa Pledges Tough Love for Ailing South African Firms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Next Africa newsletter and follow Bloomberg Africa on Twitter
President Cyril Ramaphosa said he’s ready to make tough decisions about the future of South Africa’s struggling state-owned companies, after placing the national airline into bankruptcy protection last week.
“Business rescue is not the preferred option for fixing our state-owned enterprises, nor would it be necessarily advisable in other circumstances,” Ramaphosa wrote in his weekly open letter to the country. “But the resolve we have shown in putting South African Airways into business rescue cuts across all key state-owned enterprises. We are taking all necessary measures to turn them around.”
The main task facing the government is to reduce the financial dependence the companies have on the state, and as a result, any further financial support will come with “strict conditions” designed to promote sustainability and self-sufficiency, Ramaphosa said.
“We are clear that the state will retain ownership of all those state-owned entities that are strategic,” the president said. Where necessary, South Africa will seek strategic equity partners to help raise capital, source skills and technology, and improve efficiency, he said.
SAA has posted losses since 2012 as it grappled with the high operating costs of an aging, inefficient jet fleet and a bloated workforce, on top of high taxes, political interference and corruption scandals. State-owned power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. has to rely on state bailouts to continue operating, while the government-controlled national broadcaster is also among firms battling to survive.
“Despite the depth of the current challenges, none of our state-owned entities is lost,” Ramaphosa said. “They can all be saved. But it will take extraordinary effort and, in some cases, tough decisions.”
Besides SAA, the government has taken a hard line on addressing financial and operational problems at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, with Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula announcing Monday that it had been placed under administration. The agency, which transports about 2.3 million commuters daily, has wracked up billions of rands in irregular expenditure, obtained qualified audit reports and had years of management upheaval.
“The urgency of addressing Prasa’s turn-around cannot be overemphasized, and tangible results that people can see must be realized in the shortest possible time,” Mbalula said in an emailed statement. Bongisizwe Mpondo, an entrepreneur with extensive experience in helping turn around public institutions, will run the agency for the next 12 months, whereupon a new permanent board will be appointed, he said.
(Updates with rail agency placed into administration in last two paragraphs.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Toxic’ Mueller Impeachment Article Threatens to Split Dems</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that House Democrats would proceed with articles of impeachment, she did so in the language of duty, history, and the Constitution. “This has nothing to do with politics,” she said. “It’s about the Constitution of the United States.”
In almost the same breath, Pelosi revealed that it does, in fact, have at least something to do with politics. Asked what her “a-ha” moment was—the thing that got the long-reluctant speaker on board with impeachment—she said the Ukraine allegations against President Trump “changed everything.”
“The polls,” said Pelosi, “went from 59 percent opposed to impeachment, to 34 in favor, to now even.”
That conspicuous juxtaposition of lofty principle and hard political reality highlights the tension at the heart of the impeachment process as it heads into a decisive stretch. This week, Democrats’ sense of obligation and their sense of politics will be on a collision course as lawmakers debate, draft, and introduce their articles of impeachment against Trump, which are set to be revealed within days.
That’s because the decision of what, exactly, to impeach Trump over will challenge the near-unanimity that’s existed within this big, fractious group of Democrats. Their overwhelming consensus so far has been that the president’s desire to pressure Ukraine into doing him personal political favors merited the use of the House’s most powerful check against a president for just the fourth time in the country’s history. 
No such consensus existed for other elements of Trump’s conduct in office, particularly the allegations of obstruction of justice outlined in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The majority of the public, as Pelosi noted, did not feel those charges justified impeachment—and neither did she. Even though over half of the Democratic caucus was publicly supportive of impeachment before the Ukraine story emerged, the moderate and purple-district lawmakers who won them the majority dismissed a Mueller-based impeachment drive as political suicide. 
Now, Democratic leadership and lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee—the panel that led House Democrats’ charge on all things Mueller—are weighing whether to weave that thread into articles of impeachment. Few on Capitol Hill predict this will be a fight that tears the party apart, but strong views on the subject abide, and lawmakers on both ends of the debate are anxiously bracing for a decision that amounts to something like a final judgment from House Democrats on the president’s conduct. 
“From the very beginning, we were clear that the process should be clear, strategic, and efficient,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman Democrat from a Trump-won district in Michigan. In a September op-ed written with several like-minded colleagues, Slotkin called for an impeachment inquiry based squarely on the anonymous whistleblower’s complaint. The move went down as the speaker’s come-to-Jesus moment on impeachment; she launched the inquiry the next day. 
“Clear, meaning we have to make the case to the American people. We got that strategic focus on specific articles, hone in on those—don't take a kitchen-sink approach, really think strategically. And then efficient. This doesn't need to be an 18-month process,” Slotkin told The Daily Beast on Thursday. “I have made myself clear that it should be a very tight group of articles, very limited, very focused.”
This view is not exactly shared by many of Slotkin’s colleagues. “You might say I’m in the kitchen sink caucus,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, a northern California Democrat who has long backed impeachment. 
“This office has been abused and damaged in profound ways,” Huffman said on Friday. “I personally would be for holding him accountable for every bit of it. Not for every grievance we have—I wouldn't include his bad behavior or his offensive rhetoric—but some specific actions that I believe that have abused authority and rise to the level of impeachable offense, in my view, would go well beyond the current Ukraine scandal.”
But many Democrats in this boat admit the moment is simply too important for the party to suffer any real show of discord. Huffman says he would “accept a more strategically focused set of articles if that's the decision,” but said he expected some kind of compromise to emerge. 
Over the weekend, the Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) held closed-door discussions about the possible scope of articles of impeachment and prepared members of the panel for the significant week to come. On Monday, the committee will convene for a hearing where lawmakers will hear prepared evidence for impeachment. 
According to a source familiar with the committee’s plans, Democrats spent the weekend huddling with Harvard constitutional law professor Lawrence Tribe and holding mock hearings—during which Democrats played the roles of GOP members like top Judiciary Republican Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), who has made parliamentary and process based interruptions central to the party’s hearing strategy. 
The format of the hearing is a sign that Mueller’s Russia investigation could get another high-profile public airing. On Monday, attorneys for both Judiciary and the House Intelligence Committees will present evidence that Trump committed impeachable offenses. Intelligence submitted a lengthy report on the Ukraine matter, but Judiciary has spent all year focused on Mueller. 
On Sunday, Nadler appeared on CNN and said that he is seriously considering an article of impeachment based on the Mueller findings in order to establish a “pattern” of wrongdoing by Trump that goes beyond Ukraine and encompasses his entire presidency.  
Democrats both on Nadler’s panel and around the caucus see the logic to that move. “If there is an obstruction article, how do you ignore documented evidence of obstruction by the special counsel, for which he essentially said, ‘I’m not charging because of the Justice Department policy regarding the charging of a president,’ the Congress has remedies available,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) on Friday. “To me, that's just like, a great big blinking light that says, yeah, you really need to look at that.”
An idea percolating within the caucus is that the Mueller-related charges could be put to the floor precisely so that moderates could vote against them, while the Ukraine-focused articles would stand a far stronger chance of passing. “Including one or two counts of obstruction for the Mueller report is totally appropriate,” said Huffman. “And if our more politically fragile members feel like they've got to vote against that, let them do it.”
But among those who represent competitive districts, taking such a vote may not be such an appealing prospect. One aide associated with the moderate wing of the party said any vote on Mueller-focused impeachment grounds puts these lawmakers in a “terrible position.”
“Largely, there’s no support of idea of bringing up articles about Mueller,” said the aide, calling the investigation’s entire subject matter politically “toxic” in the districts these lawmakers represent. This wing of the party is anxiously watching to see how Nadler—likely with a heavy hand from the speaker—draws up the articles. “Thirty-one Democratic members of Congress in Trump districts are going to be living with the decisions he makes for the next year,” said the aide.
There’s some hope, however, that this could result in some kind of compromise to be brokered this week that reconciles the tension baked into Democrats’ impeachment enterprise. “I mean, we're not gonna send everybody home happy,” said Huffman. “That's just inherent in the situation that has been forced upon us.”
Among some of the lawmakers who decided to support impeachment knowing it could be a liability back home, there’s a sense that the most important Rubicon has already been crossed.
“For many of us, if this was purely a political issue, we would not have come out in support of an inquiry,” said Slotkin, who is just one of several Democrats already seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of impeachment-based attack ads against them in their districts. 
“So you have this threshold where you say, doesn't matter what a poll says, it doesn't matter what my consultants are telling me to do, what matters is right and wrong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elizabeth Warren Built the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It Became a Revolving Door.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) began staffing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 and 2011, she did something that appeared, at first blush, to be highly counterintuitive. 
Instead of limiting staff to those with extensive background in consumer activism and regulatory policy, she chose people with places like Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Capital One on their CVs.
Those financial institutions were the very entities that the CFPB was supposed to haunt. The agency had been included in financial regulatory reform as a wishlist item for Wall Street-skeptical progressives. And yet, here was Warren—the intellectual godmother of the CFPB—handing out key roster assignments to officials from those very institutions. 
Before long, the supply chain was working the other way. As the CFPB carried out its mission during the Obama years, undertaking reforms to practices from aggressive debt collection to payday lending to mortgage finance rules, some of its senior staffers would leave the agency to work in the financial sector, many of them helping major banking and securities firms understand and navigate the rules they’d just helped write. As the agency pursued billions in civil penalties against financial firms, some of its senior officials found themselves on the payrolls of the sort of companies the CFPB was created to scrutinize and hold accountable.
It’s the sort of “revolving door” between government industry that Warren has decried as a progressive stalwart in the Senate and a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. And it could complicate her efforts to make the CFPB a cornerstone of her White House bid by drawing cries of hypocrisy from campaign rivals. 
But beyond the talking points, the hirings also offer an unexpected window into Warren’s approach to governance, suggesting that she’s a shrewder, more pragmatic policymaker than her persona as a populist firebrand indicates.
In the Warren vs. Dimon Feud, It’s Warren, Not Even Close
The CFPB was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, which resulted in mass mortgage defaults and hammered American debtors. Warren, then a Harvard professor, had dreamt up the idea and became the Obama administration's point person in devising a new agency to serve as a consumer finance watchdog and ensure that borrowers were not being fleeced by the financial institutions on which their livelihoods depended. Warren never actually led the agency, which was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. There were internal White House fears that her presence atop the CFPB would spark immense backlash among Senate Republicans, so she was made a “senior adviser” with heavy sway over its inception and—most critically—early staffing decisions. 
“She was monstrously productive from a recruiting point of view,” recalled Raj Date, who served as CFPB’s associate director of research, markets, and regulation. “I grew up around successful recruiting engines—at McKinsey, at Capital One—and I have never seen a human being better at recruiting than her.”
Warren’s central role was evident in a report that the CFPB released in 2011 recapping its creation and launch and the early progress it had made as the nation’s first federal consumer finance watchdog. She wrote a letter of introduction for the report, hailing the “strong foundation” for the agency and pledging, “in the years ahead, the CFPB will work hard for consumers across the country.”
The report identified 21 people in senior CFPB leadership positions that had been instrumental in getting the new agency off the ground. They included some notable names from the financial sector. Date had been a managing director at Deutsche Bank in addition to his prior roles at McKinsey and Capital One. Elizabeth Vale, who oversaw community banks and credit unions at the agency, had been a managing director at Morgan Stanley. CFPB’s chief operating officer, Catherine West, had led Capital One’s credit card division.
Take a Bow, Elizabeth Warren
While Warren plucked talent from the financial services industries, the relationship became even more intertwined over the subsequent years. Nearly half of the senior officials—nine out of the 21—mentioned in that report would go on to work in financial services, or for law or consulting firms with expertise and clientele in the sector, after their tenure at the CFPB.
Roberto Gonzalez, for instance, served as the agency's deputy general counsel before becoming a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP. He “represents financial institutions and other companies in high-stakes litigation, investigations and advisory matters,” according to the law firm’s website, which boasts that he helped “a major U.S. bank in connection with a favorable settlement with the CFPB.”
“Roberto is an extraordinary lawyer with deep knowledge of the broad range of complex issues facing financial institutions, including, specifically, in the areas of financial regulation, DoddFrank, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and cybersecurity,” the firm’s chairman told Law360 in 2016. “Needless to say, Roberto’s expertise is in high demand today.”
It’s precisely that sort of demand that fuels Washington’s revolving door, and has created a cottage industry of former regulators who cash out to the industries they once regulated. Such moves can create perverse incentives for government employment: Those who go into public service in the hope of landing a lucrative private sector career afterward may be just as willing to side with industry in the hope of future pay as former industry lobbyists and executives who move into government positions.
“In many ways, I find revolving out into industry more problematic than coming from industry,” said Jeff Hauser, the executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, in an interview. “That influences your incentives in office, if you think you’re going to go work in this industry... There’s a willingness to rock the boat that I think is diminished if you want to enter the field that you’d be shaking up.”
Hauser noted, though, that Warren has proposed policies that would have blocked at least some of the career moves that CFPB staffers took into private industries if they had been in effect at the time. That’s something the Warren campaign stressed as well.
“Elizabeth is the leader—Republican or Democrat—in proposing a set of serious anti-corruption reforms and it will be her top priority to make them law,” campaign spokeswoman Saloni Sharma said in an emailed statement. “Her legislation will expand the definition of lobbyists to include anyone paid to influence lawmakers and ban giant companies, banks, and monopolies from hiring former senior government officials for at least four years.” 
Warren has also committed to imposing those standards on her administration if she’s elected president, even barring any action on the proposed legislation by Congress.
Warren’s campaign did not address more specific questions about the revolving door between the early CFPB and the companies it regulated. Those questions go to the heart of the dilemma facing policymakers as they look to effectively wield the nation’s regulatory agencies while preventing and rooting out corruption: namely, how to staff the federal administrative apparatus with people who know the issues in their portfolio but are driven by public, not private, interests.
As a presidential candidate, Warren has come down firmly on the anti-corruption side of that dilemma—blocking or at least slowing the revolving door. But that approach can come at the expense of expertise that former industry insiders can offer. It can also preclude the private sector companies from hiring the very regulators who can help them make sense of often complex regulatory regimes and even imbue their industry with a sense of mission. 
It’s the latter approach that Warren appears to have embraced in the early days of the CFPB. She often stressed that the agency was drawing talent and expertise from a host of backgrounds, including industry, in an effort to craft a more effective regulatory apparatus.
It’s an approach that Date described as a break from traditional progressive thinking on financial watchdog efforts, which often elevate consumer advocates and lawyers. 
“If you want to build and operate these agencies well, it cannot just be a bunch of lawyers,” he said. “This notion that a critical qualification to make policy for an industry is to have never been in it—the idea that you are more capable the less you know—I find that notion, on its face, absurd.”
The other side of the CFPB revolving door had its benefits, too, Date said. The dispersal of people from the agency, who were instrumental in its creation and committed to its mission, into the financial services industry had an evangelizing effect, he said.
"There are lots of reasons where I thought the most important thing longer-term was to take people, a nontrivial number of people, who live what it’s like to be the enforcers and articulators of what the right principles should be, it would be good if you take people who internalized what these principled-based views should be and take that into industry,” Date said. “That’s good. We have suffered from that in consumer finance."

Paris (AFP) - France's transport chaos deepened Monday on the fifth day of a nationwide strike over pension reforms, ramping up tensions at the start of a crucial week in President Emmanuel Macron's battle with trade unions.
With only two of the Paris metro's 16 lines running as normal and suburban trains also heavily disrupted, many commuters slipped behind the wheel to try to get to work in torrential rain, causing major gridlock.
By 9 am, the tailbacks in the Paris area ran to 600 kilometres (370 miles), twice the normal level, the Sytadin monitoring website said.
Large queues formed at bus stops following an announcement that one out of two buses would be running but striking workers blocked seven out of 25 bus depots, leaving more travellers stranded.
With many having opted to work from home last week and only now returning to the workplace, this week will test public support for the strike.
A poll Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper showed 53 percent of the French supporting the strike or expressing sympathy for their demands, up six points in a week.
Unions have called a second day of mass protests for Tuesday, a day before the government unveils the full details of its plans for a single points-based pension scheme that does away with dozens of more advantageous plans enjoyed by train drivers, sailors, lawyers and other professions.
- 'A monstrosity' -
Critics argue that the shake-up will require people in both the public and private sector to work longer for a smaller retirement payout.
Teachers are expected to walk out again for the second time in a week Tuesday, leading to widespread school closures.
Firefighters, electricity workers and "yellow vest" anti-government demonstrators have also joined railway workers in the streets in recent days.
The government's pensions envoy Jean-Paul Delevoye, who drafted the reforms, and Health Minister Agnes Buzyn will meet with trade unions on Monday to try to negotiate an end to the deadlock.
But the unions have sounded an uncompromising note.
"I will not negotiate over the implementation of what I describe as a monstrosity which endangers tomorrow's pensioners," said Yves Veyrier, the head of the militant Force Ouvriere union.
The strike has squeezed retailers in the run-up to Christmas, raising the prospect of another bleak year-end after the unrest caused by the yellow vests in late 2018.
The first day of the stoppage already caused an average 30 percent drop in sales, according to the Alliance of Commerce, which represents 27,000 supermarkets and clothing and shoe stores with almost 200,000 workers.
A hotel association said reservations in the larger Paris region dropped by 30 to 40 percent on the first day of the strike.
Regional and international trains, including the Eurostar to London and Thalys to Brussels, have also been hobbled by the unrest, and several flights were cancelled on the first days of the strike.
- Fairer system for all? -
Over 800,000 people took to the streets when the strike was launched on December 5, many accusing Macron of trying to weaken France's generous social safety net.
The president, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and senior cabinet ministers met late Sunday to discuss the changes, which they argue will ensure a fairer and more sustainable system for all.
"If we do not carry out a far-reaching, serious and progressive reform today, someone else will do a really brutal one tomorrow," Philippe told Le Journal du Dimanche.
The strike has drawn comparisons with late 1995 when three weeks of strikes forced the then centre-right government to withdraw its pension reforms.
Adrien Quatennens, a lawmaker from the far-left France Unbowed party, acknowledged on LCI radio that the strike was hard on businesses and commuters, but said: "It's better to endure a few weeks of hassle than... years of hardship" in retirement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The GOP wall: Why Republicans won't walk away from Trump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — Late in the afternoon of Aug. 7, 1974, Republican leaders in Congress traveled up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House to deliver a stark message to Richard Nixon: His presidency was over.
The public had turned on Nixon as evidence emerged about his role in the Watergate scandal and the bottom fell out once his own party abandoned him.
"None of us doubted the outcome. He would resign," conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater later wrote of the meeting in his memoir. Two days later, Nixon stepped down.
Today, as Democrats in the House of Representatives move toward bringing articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, with the next Judiciary Committee hearing of evidence set for Monday, few Democrats are still clinging to the hope that Republicans will reach a breaking point with Trump like they did with Nixon.
"I really don't think there is any fact that would change their minds," Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told NBC News.
Why? Two key changes since Nixon: a massive divide in American political life — we hate the other team more than ever before — and a media climate that fuels and reinforces that chasm, powered by Fox News on the Republican side.
Himes said he was "a little stunned by the unanimity on the Republican side," especially among retiring lawmakers who don't have to worry about surviving a GOP primary had they gone against Trump. "We're in a place right now where all that matters to my Republican colleagues is the defense of the president," he added.
No Republican congressmen have said they support impeachment. In the Senate, the entire GOP voted to condemn the impeachment inquiry, except for three moderates: Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The three have stopped short of saying they support Trump's impeachment, however, and it would take at least 20 Republican senators to vote to convict him in a Senate trial for removal to succeed.
Meanwhile, pollsshow Americans' views on Trump and impeachment have barely budged, even though millions tuned in to watch the televised hearings before the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees over the last few weeks.
The sliver of the electorate that remains undecided seems to be mainly those paying the least attention to politics, so it's unclear whether new information would really even sway them.
"The numbers still don't look good for Trump, but they definitely haven't gotten worse," pollster Tim Malloy of Quinnipiac University said.
That's not how it happened 45 years ago, when televised Watergate hearings helped turn the tide of public opinion against a president who had just been re-elected in a landslide. The public pressure helped push a number of Republicans to abandon Nixon and join a bipartisan impeachment drive.
William Cohen, a former GOP House member, senator and Secretary of Defense from Maine, doesn't think that will happen today.
He was one of seven Republicans out of 17 on the House Judiciary Committee who voted to advance articles of impeachment against Nixon and was one of the most vocal critics of Watergate at the time.
"We're living in a really different era," he said. "The partisanship is deeper. It's a cynical, suspicious society. The conspiracy theories that were once fringe elements have been allowed to filter into the mainstream."
Until relatively recently, the political parties were jumbled coalitions of regional, ideological and racial groups that included conservative Democrats in the South and liberal Republicans from the Northeast.
The first Republican senator to call for Nixon's resignation, for instance, was an African American from Massachusetts, Edward Brooke.
And Nixon found staunch support among some Democrats, too, many of whom represented working-class areas that had been part of the "silent majority" that helped the president win 49 out of 50 states in his 1972 re-election. As late as July of 1974, just days before Republicans leaders went to the White House to tell Nixon to quit, The Washington Post estimated there were still about 25 House Democrats in the "never" camp on impeachment.
Both support for and opposition to impeachment were bipartisan.
Since then, the Democratic and Republican parties have slowly congealed into monoliths of like-minded Americans who not only vote the same way, but also tend to live in the same kinds of neighborhoods, listen to the same kinds of music, worship (or not) the same way — even wear the same kinds of jeans.
Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it's not just polarization, but "tribalism."
"That means anyone who is not part of your tribe is the enemy," Ornstein said. "And anything you do to take on your own tribe becomes heresy. And I think that's different from what we had before."
Political scientists call it "negative partisanship" because Americans are now often driven more by wanting to punish the other side than wanting to advance their own cause.
Republicans know well by now that anyone who steps out of line in Trump's GOP faces near certain excommunication and humiliation, with a long trail of upended careers as proof in the likes of Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Mark Sanford. No one is safe, not even Sen. John McCain, a war hero.
"I've never seen anything like it," Cohen said. "The Republican Party today is not loyal to principles as such, but loyal to the person of Donald Trump. He is really a cult figure. Nixon was not a cult figure. With Nixon, you didn't feel the personal loyalty to the man, but to the party."
As the political landscape cleaved in the past 40 years, so did the way voters get information about politics and the trust they put in it.
Americans had little choice but to learn about Watergate through the mainstream media. There were only three major TV networks, so they couldn't switch away to a cable or streaming show when their program got interrupted by special reports on the Watergate hearings.
The result was more than 70 percent of the country tuned in to at least part of the Watergate hearings. And they generally believed the news.
The vast majority of Americans — 69 percent — said in 1974 that they trusted the media to report the news "fully, accurately and fairly," according to Gallup. That number has plummeted to just 41 percent today.
The collapse is driven largely by Republicans. Today, just 15 percent of Republicans say they generally trust the mainstream media, compared with 69 percent of Democrats.
There's only one news outlet that a majority of Republicans told Gallup they trust today: Fox News.
Of course, key voices on Fox and other conservative media outlets have consistently defended Trump, attacked Democrats, sown doubt about the mainstream press, and advanced alternative theories, often lacking basis and of a conspiratorial nature, to explain away any damaging facts about Trump that have emerged from the inquiry.
John Dean, the former Nixon White House lawyer who helped turn the tide on Watergate by testifying against the president, has famously said that Nixon "might have survived if there'd been a Fox News."
"Polarization cannot be a justification for Republican facts, morality and rule of law or a Democratic facts, morality and rule of law," Dean added in an email to NBC News. "If polarization justifies multiple realities, democracy as we know it has ended."
But Nixon biographer John Farrell noted the mainstream press had a more positive view of Nixon that the famed story of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's hard-nosed reporting often obscures.
"Nixon's support in the 1972 election was widespread in the press," Farrell said. "He was probably endorsed by 90 percent of the nation's newspaper editorial boards. It took a very long time for the press to come around and it took an even longer time for the public to follow."
Today, conservative media has doubled down on support for Trump, reassuring its audience there's nothing to be concerned about, either in Trump's actions with Ukraine or Democrats' decision to draft articles of impeachment against him.
"The Democrats have just hoisted themselves on their own petard, guaranteeing Donald Trump re-election in 2020," Fox host Jeanine Pirro said in a clip Trump tweeted to her millions of followers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Macron positive after Zelenskiy's first face-to-face with Putin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for the first time since taking office, at a summit in Paris on Monday to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine.
Convened by French President Emmanuel Macron and also attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the summit is the first real test for the Ukrainian leader who ran for office on a pledge to end the protracted conflict in his country.
Adding to the pressure for the comedian-turned-politician is the fact that thousands rallied on Sunday in Kyiv calling on him not to "capitulate" and grant Putin too many concessions.
More than 13,000 people have died in the five-year conflict opposing Ukrainian security forces and Russian-backed separatists, including some 3,300 civilians, according to the UN.
A ceasefire was agreed to in the Minsk Protocol signed in 2014 but has been violated with outbreaks of fighting regularly recorded near Donetsk and Luhansk.
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Macron hailed the very fact the summit was held as an achievement.
"The fact that we are side by side today in Paris is in itself an important outcome in many ways, a credible resuming that is in no way obtained in advance considering the absence of a concrete progress for several years," he said.
Angela Merkel meanwhile said while there is a lot of work to do, there is "goodwill to resolve difficult questions", adding she was very pleased with the meeting.
Zelenskiy argued in a Facebook video released last week that the meeting "is already a victory for Ukraine".
He then defended the decision to meet with Putin despite the Russian leader refusing to put the annexed peninsula of Crimea on the negotiating table by telling Ukrainian television that Russia's release of Ukrainian sailors and vessels is "a signal that Russia is ready to talk".
But expectations of a breakthrough are fairly low.
Analysts say that Zelenskiy in particular needs to return home with "something tangible."
"A cease-fire and a prisoner swap should be well within reach. No party will want to walk home empty-handed, and at least officially, both Ukraine and Russia are interested in a cessation of hostilities and the return of prisoners," Cyrus Newlin and Jeffrey Mankoff from the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank, wrote in a note last week.
Beyond Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, one of the main areas of contention is the province of Donbas — where Donetsk and Luhansk are located — and its status.
Zelenskiy has stressed that elections would only be held in the separatist-held province once Moscow had relinquished control of the border and withdrawn its troops.
But Russia is unlikely to do so, having advocated for the region to be granted a special status which would see it continue to exert influence in Ukrainian politics.
Zelenskiy has called on both Paris and Berlin to support his position on the different issues but the latest summit comes amidst a push by Macron to reopen "a strategic dialogue" with Russia.
"If we want to build peace in Europe, to rebuild European strategic autonomy, we need to reconsider our position with Russia," he told the Economist magazine last month.
Zelenskiy, who used to play the Ukrainian leader in a popular television show before his election, might find a more receptive audience in Merkel.
Germany expelled two Russian diplomats last week over Moscow's suspected involvement in the murder of a Georgian activist in Berlin.

Many of those critically injured were flown to Auckland to a specialist burns unit.”
At least five people have died after a volcano erupted in New Zealand. Police say around 50 visitors were near the popular tourist site of White Island when the active volcano began erupting on Monday at 2 p.m. local time. Several people have been taken to hospital with critical injuries. The authorities are now planning to launch a search and rescue mission but say it is too dangerous to reach the area at the moment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">LTA awards S$210 million contract for Jurong West, Bahar Junction MRT stations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE: Two Jurong Region Line stations will be designed and constructed by the Singapore branch of China Railway 11 Bureau Group, the Land Transport Authority said on Monday (Dec 9).
The S$210.1 million contract for the Jurong West and Bahar Junction stations also includes 1.15km of viaducts.
Jurong West station will be located along Jurong West Avenue 2, adjacent to Jurong West Street 23. The station will have a single island platform serving trains for both the Choa Chu Kang-bound and Jurong Pier-bound directions.
Bahar Junction station will be located along Jurong West Avenue 4, near the junction of Jurong West Street 64 and Street 75. It will have two platforms connected by a 100-metre covered link bridge with travellators.
One platform will serve trains heading to Choa Chu Kang and Jurong Pier while the other platform will serve trains heading to Peng Kang Hill.
LTA said the Singapore branch of the China Railway 11 Bureau Group is an "established and experienced” construction company that has completed various rail-related projects worldwide.
The company has completed several major infrastructure projects in Singapore including three MRT stations - Tuas Link, Tuas West Road and Tuas Crescent stations - and their associated viaducts on the East-West Line’s Tuas West Extension.
“The company also constructed Singapore’s first integrated rail and road viaduct as part of the Tuas West Extension project,” LTA added.
The Jurong Region Line is Singapore’s seventh MRT line, which will open in three stages starting from 2026.
The 24km-long line will have 24 stations above ground, and will connect with the North-South Line and East-West Line with interchange stations at Boon Lay, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East MRT stations.
The Jurong Region Line is expected to serve 200,000 commuters daily in its initial phase of operation. This is expected to grow to more than 500,000 commuters daily in the longer term, according to LTA.​​​​​​​
Construction is expected to start in 2020 and be completed in 2026.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US confirms Washington visit by Russian foreign minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will welcome his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday (Dec 10) - the Russian's first visit to Washington since a controversial 2017 meeting with US President Donald Trump, the State Department announced.
The brief statement about the meeting, to be held at the State Department, said Pompeo and Lavrov would "discuss a broad range of regional and bilateral issues."
On Friday, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the meeting was being "prepared" for Tuesday.
The situations in war-wracked Syria and Ukraine are likely to top the agenda. The Washington meeting will come on the heels of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky over the conflict in Ukraine's east in Paris on Monday.
Iran and North Korea are also of mutual concern in Washington and Moscow.
Pompeo and Lavrov met in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.
But Lavrov has not been on an official visit to the US capital since his encounter with Trump in the Oval Office in May 2017, which was followed by allegations that the US leader divulged classified intelligence in the meeting.
Photographs of the meeting showed Lavrov, Trump and subsequently sacked Russian envoy to Washington Sergei Kislyak sharing a laugh.
US intelligence concluded that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election with an eye to swinging it in Trump's favor, but US special counsel Robert Mueller found there was not enough evidence to prove that Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian government in those efforts.
The report did not conclude that Trump had committed a crime, but it also did not fully exonerate him.
"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state," Mueller's long-awaited report said.
"Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW CLARK CITY, Philippines: Singapore swimmers Jonathan Tan and Teong Tzen Wei both clocked the same time (22.46) in the men's 50m freestyle heats to set a joint-new SEA Games record on Monday (Dec 9).
Swimming in two different heats, both of them managed to eclipse the 22.47 set by Joseph Schooling at the 2015 Games in Singapore.
This also means that Teong, the defending champion in the event, equals the national record set by Tan earlier this year. 
Tan, 17, and Teong, 22, have qualified for the finals of the event, slated to be held later tonight.
Singapore’s swimmers have clinched a total of 18 golds so far in the competition.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: Shoemaker Skechers USA is expected to post earnings growth on pace with Nike over the next three years, giving its relatively low valuation a chance of catching up, financial newspaper Barron's reported in its Dec 7 edition.
Analysts estimate Skechers' earnings-per-share will rise 15 per cent this year and in 2020, and 12 per cent in 2021. Yet Nike trades at about 30 times analysts' future earnings estimates, compared with 16 times for Sketchers, even after Skechers shares soared more than 75 per cent this year, the paper said.
Skechers sells trainers, dress shoes, sandals and boots - a broader range than Nike - and has grown over the past 20 years to become the third-largest global footwear brand by revenue, after Nike and Adidas, the paper said.
Skechers styles, often priced at US$50 to US$70, are perceived as "cool" and good value, an edge its bigger rivals lack, Barron's added.
"Nike and Adidas are reluctant to identify as value brands, giving Skechers room to run," Barron's said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sepang racing team confident of lifting EWC title with solid trio</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — With the backing of local fans and a solid combination comprising endurance specialist Michael Van der Mark, national racer Hafizh Syahrin Abdullah and MotoGP star Franco Morbidelli, Sepang Racing Team is confident of winning the Endurance World Championship (EWC).
The three big names in motorsports have come together under the Sepang Racing Team banner to participate in the “Races of Malaysia” which simultaneously serves up two- and four-wheel races from December 13 to 15.
Hafizh expressed confidence with their combination and expected them to do well.
“I have experienced teammates in Van der Mark and Morbidelli. I am confident with the package given to this team; we will produce the best results. Or at least in the top three.
“The home race at Sepang would give an extraordinary boost to my spirit, especially with the support of fans. I hope our team will qualify for the Suzuka 8 Hours race in Japan,” he told Bernama today.
The EWC, known as Sepang 8 Hours which will be held at the Sepang Circuit for the first time, is the second round of the EWC calendar for the 2019-2020 season, apart from serving as a qualifying round for Asian teams to Suzuka 8 Hours next year.
Hafizh praised the EWC for creating a qualifying race to Suzuka 8 Hours in Malaysia because only eligible teams will be picked to race compared to the previous edition which attracted too many teams.
“We could see that the year before too many went to race at Suzuka 8 Hours. Some teams were so slow to the extent of endangering other racers who are faster. This is a very long race; EWC wants to avoid accidents. With this race, teams going to Suzuka will be more qualified,” he said.
Meanwhile, his teammate Van der Mark, better known as an endurance specialist, admitted he is absolutely excited and is looking forward to racing in his favourite track in Sepang. 
Although he has not had a chance to test the track yet, he remembers the sensation of racing at the Sepang circuit. The Dutchman has previously raced at Sepang in both World Superbike and MotoGP.
“In endurance race we have three riders so the setup of the bike is never perfect; you have to find a compromise before you start the weekend. So it is a little different than normal race like MotoGP.
“However, we will always try to make the best of all three of us. We have to share the bike with three riders and normally when we are racing we want to beat everyone. For example, you want to beat your teammate but in this race you need to work together.
“So the excitement is totally different. When you have done your part, you have to wait and see your teammate. You can’t say anything to him; everything is in the control of the guy on the bike,” he said.
Apart from EWC, the Sepang circuit will also host the World Touring Car Cup (WTCR), which is expected to be participated by seven world champions, with Malaysia to be represented by Hafizh, Mitchell Cheah and Douglas Khoo, who be making their debut in WTCR. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Insurance, road tax for Zahid's 20 vehicles paid by Yayasan Akalbudi, court told</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — The High Court today was told that the road tax and insurance for 20 vehicles belonging to former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi amounting RM107,509.55 was paid using funds from Yayasan Akalbudi Foundation fund, between January and September 2015.
Allianz General Insurance agent, Ahmad Izhan Abd Rashid, 40, said the payment was received through three Affin Bank checks belonging to the foundation from Ahmad Zahid’s personal assistant, Major Mazlina Mazlan.
The 14th prosecution witness said the cheque dated January 22, 2015 was for RM24,980.55, another cheque for RM43,645 was dated April 15, 2015, while the third cheque was dated September 22, 2015, for RM38,884.
“The cheques were written in my name because after I deposited the cheques, I will withdraw some amount for payment of the road tax because the payment was made in cash to the Road Transport Department (JPJ).
“I would also withdraw a certain amount of money to be deposited in a current account belonging to Maya Consultant Services (which belongs to Ahmad Izhan) for the purpose of paying for the car insurance premiums,” he said when reading out his witness statement during examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Lee Keng Fatt.
Ahmad Izhan said this on the ninth day Ahmad Zahid’s trial on 47 charges — 12 for criminal breach of trust (CBT), eight for corruption and 27 for money laundering — involving tens of millions of ringgit in funds belonging to Akalbudi Foundation.
The witness, who has been an agent for the insurance company since 2006, said the former deputy prime minister took 39 car insurance policies from him and they were for 20 vehicles, including 18 luxury vehicles such as BMW X5, Mini Coopers S, BMW 320i (A), Mercedes Benz CLS350 and a BMW R1200 GS motorcycle.
Prior to this, 13th witness, Fang Suat Lim, who is the manager of the Allianz General Insurance branch at Wisma Allianz, Jalan Gereja, here, told the court that Ahmad Zahid took four types of insurance policies, namely ‘private car policy’, ‘motorcycle policy’ , ‘enhanced road warrior policy’ and ‘bike warrior policy’.
She said the nominees for the insurance were Ahmad Zahid, his wife, Datin Seri Hamidah Khamis, and their children, Nurulizwani, Datuk Nurulhidayah and Ahmad Syafiq Hazieq.
Meanwhile, Ahmad Izhan told the court that he would go to Ahmad Zahid’s house at Country Heights, Kajang to handover the insurance policies and road tax of the vehicles concerned.
When questioned by Ahmad Zahid’s lawyer, Hamidi Mohd Noh, Ahmad Izhan concurred with the counsel that the ink used to sign and write the particulars on the three cheques was not the same.
Ahmad Izhan said he also agreed with Hamidi that the cheques were presign cheques.
When re-examined by Lee, the witness said he knew the three checks were ‘presign cheques’ as Mazlina told him that she would get Ahmad Zahid to sign the blank cheques, and she would fill the necessary particulars, to speed up the matter.
The hearing before judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues tomorrow. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chong: Sugar supply liberalisation will benefit consumers in the long run</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUCHING, Dec 9 — The liberalisation policy on sugar supply in Sarawak will not result in an immediate effect to the price of the commodity but will definitely benefit consumers in the long term, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Deputy Minister Chong Chieng Jen said today.
He said the policy, however, broke up the monopolies held by certain companies which dictated the supply and price of sugar in the state in the past, thus lowering the costs of business and reducing inflation in the long run.
“The main difference between the present PH government and the past BN (Barisan Nasional) government is that the BN government creates monopolies, thereby increases the cost of business which ultimately leads to prices of goods increases,” he said in a statement.
The statement came following the revelation of 11 companies which had been given the permit to import sugar to the state recently through the liberalisation of supply policy.
“The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs will continue with its liberalisation of sugar policy and open to applications by any F&B (food and beverages) manufacturers in Sarawak, (whether) big or small, and we don’t need connection like it used to be during BN’s time,” he added. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dollar holds ground as central bank meetings loom, pound jumps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON, Dec 9 — The dollar held its ground today thanks to last week’s stronger-than-expected jobs data, although worries about US/China trade talks kept gains in check, while Britain’s pound jumped on the latest polls ahead of this week’s election.
Sterling hit a fresh 2-1/2 year high against the euro after the latest opinion polls showed the governing Conservative Party has extended its lead over rivals ahead of Thursday’s national election.
Meanwhile, the dollar stood its ground in the wake of Friday’s jobs data. Attention shifted to US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policy meetings this week, while a deadline looms for the next wave of US tariffs on Chinese goods to kick in.
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that a December 15 deadline is still in place to impose a new round of US tariffs on Chinese consumer goods, but President Donald Trump likes where trade talks with China are going.
“If we see Donald Trump decide not to delay tariffs, that would lead to a risk off reaction in markets,” said Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester.
“We don’t expect tariffs to go into effect as the talks are ongoing,” he said, adding he did not expect any “fireworks” from the central bank meetings.
The dollar index was little changed at 97.63, after rising 0.3 per cent on Friday on news that US nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain in 10 months.
Europe’s single currency traded at US$1.1064 (RM4.60), after hitting a one-week low of US$1.10395 on Friday.
The dollar changed hands at 108.52 yen. It had lifted to 108.92 yen on the US jobs data before losing momentum.
Analysts said Friday’s jobs numbers was positive for the greenback, bolstering expectations that the Fed would this week continue to signal a pause in its rate-cutting cycle.
“As long as more people are working and getting paid more, consumer demand is likely to hold up – that should keep the US economy going and reduce the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates again,” said Marshall Gittler, strategist at ACLS Global.
Data meanwhile showing China’s exports shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November, underscored persistent pressures on manufacturers from the Sino-US trade war.
Elsewhere, sterling rallied to a seven-month high at US$1.3180 and to a 2-1/2 year peak versus the euro at 83.94 as the latest polls fuelled optimism that Thursday’s election will end near-term Brexit uncertainty.
The ruling Conservative Party extended its lead over the opposition Labour Party to 14 percentage points, up from 9 a week ago, an opinion poll by Survation for ITV’s Good Morning Britain showed on Monday. — Reuters

    <h5 class="mb-1">Malaysians spend 70pc of monthly income on goods, housing and transport, says minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — Almost 70 per cent of Malaysians’ monthly income are spent on goods, housing and transport, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said.
Based on a World Bank Group report, the cost of living shouldered by Malaysians was mainly due to the three said components, he said.
“In addition, the report states that the lower the people’s income, the more they spend on food, while those with higher income spend more on leisure such as travel or to visit recreational clubs and so on.
“So from here we can see that when there is a cost price increase of goods and the low income group are the most affected,” he told reporters after launching the Malaysia Economic Monitor’s latest update — “Making Ends Meet” here today.
The 21st edition of the report also touched on income stagnation when cost of living rises, he said.
In view of this, he said his ministry, in its capacity as the secretariat of the National Cost of Living Action Council (NACCOL) will adopt several initiatives to overcome the problem.
“I have some ideas on the shifts needed on focus and priorities and how NACCOL can move into 2020 we cannot be contended with what we have now, we must do more than this,” he said.
Meanwhile, Saifuddin Nasution in his speech said NACCOL is currently looking into reducing the prices of food items and increasing the income of food producers by eliminating layers of middlemen in the food supply chain.
“Recently I visited fisherman jetty in Sekinchan and Sungai Besar and spoke to fishermen, the price of indian mackerel cost only RM5 to RM6 per kilogram (kg) and about 1.5 kilometer away from the jetty at the wet market the price is RM13 per kg.
“I have given instruction to my secretary-general (Datuk Muez Abdul Aziz) to really look into it and we are committed to work with Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry regarding this matter. For the coming year, this will be one of my main priorities in our efforts to reduce the cost of living,” he said.
Moving forward, the government will continue to improve public transportation services, particularly last-mile connectivity as well as creating more affordable housing and also introducing creative, innovative schemes to boost and reduce the burden of home ownership, he said.
He added that through his ministry, Food Bank Malaysia and Food Bank Siswa programmes were initiated, which to date, have provided food security to over 400,000 families and 7,000 university students. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">European companies minimise risks from US-China trade war</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING, Dec 9 — European companies in China have been able to minimise the effect from the tariff war between Beijing and Washington, although some are considering relocating their businesses, the EU Chamber of Commerce said today.
The world’s two biggest economies have been entangled in a lingering trade war for over a year, which has weighed on the global economy and resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs slapped on two-way trade.
European companies in China “have effectively negated the tariff effects in a relatively short space of time,” said the president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, Joerg Wuttke.
Many companies have “effectively side-stepped” the steep tariffs by rejigging their supply chains and leveraging their global corporate networks, the chamber said in a statement.
According to a survey of its members released Monday, 64 per cent of respondents said they have not noticed “any change” in their business as a result of the trade war.
Another 10 per cent said they were “completely affected” by the trade war.
However, many European companies said they expected the trade war to be “long-lasting”, and 10 per cent have already changed suppliers.
At the time of the survey, another eight per cent had already relocated parts of their business out of China or were planning to do so — mainly to elsewhere in southeast Asia — while 15 per cent had delayed investment or expansion decisions because of the trade war.
This figure was up from six per cent since the previous survey in January.
The report, which surveyed 174 companies in China, was completed in September and is released as China and the US continue to negotiate a way to reach a “phase one” trade deal.
In the absence of any agreement, Washington is threatening to impose 15 per cent additional customs surcharges on December 15, which will apply to Chinese goods which have so far been spared, including cellphones and sportswear.
They account for some US$160 billion in annual imports. — AFP

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — IHH Healthcare Bhd hopes to complete its proposed acquisition of the Prince Court Medical Centre in the first quarter of 2020, following the strong approval obtained from its shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting today.
In a statement, the healthcare provider said over 99.99 per cent of non-interested shareholders and proxies voted in favour of the conditional share purchase agreement valued for a cash consideration of RM1.02 billion.
Joe Sim, chief executive officer, Malaysia Operations Division said Prince Court would empower IHH to bring its best-in-class care and outcomes to even more patients in Malaysia and abroad.
“With a broader network and stronger cluster of specialised tertiary hospitals in the Klang Valley, supported by a deeper clinical talent pool, IHH can offer a wider array of services and take on more complex cases.
“This will make our facilities even more compelling for both local and foreign patients, and further reinforces Malaysia’s attractiveness as a medical travel destination,” he said.
Strategically located in the Golden Triangle of Kuala Lumpur, Prince Court is a 277-licensed bed private healthcare facility offering a wide range of services, including burns management, cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, interventional cardiology, in vitro fertilisation, nephrology, occupational health, orthopaedic, and rehabilitation medicine.
IHH said Prince Court is a profitable operation that is expected to enhance the group’s revenue and income stream, and contribute to its long-term growth. — Bernama

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — Bursa Malaysia finished lower today on subdued sentiments as weak export data from China, the country’s biggest trading partner, signalled weakness for the broader Asian economy.
At 5pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) fell 5.73 points to 1,562.71 from Friday’s close of 1,568.44.
The barometer index opened 2.26 points lower at 1,566.18 and moved between 1,560.2 and 1,567.78 throughout the day.
A dealer said the softer export data had also offset the positive Wall Street clues following solid US jobs print.
“Investor sentiment was hit after data projected that China exports in November shrank for the fourth straight month, implying that the trade war with the United States was taking a toll on the world’s second-largest economy,” he said.
On the local bourse, heavyweight Maybank added six sen to RM8.56.
TNB lost 20 sen to RM13.22, Public Bank fell 14 sen to RM19.02, Petronas Chemicals shed five sen to RM7.05 and CIMB eased two sen to RM5.18.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sabah govt views seriously re-emergence of polio, says Shafie</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KOTA KINABALU, Dec 9 — The Sabah government views seriously the re-emergence of polio in the state, the first for the country after almost 30 years, and will do its level best to ensure that it will not spread, Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal said.
He said the re-emergence of the disease is not something that should be taken lightly.
Hence, he said he had instructed the state’s Ministry of Health and People’s Wellbeing to take necessary action to address the situation.
“They will give me a complete report on this and, so far, I was made to understand that the case has been handled well to ensure that the disease will not spread.
“I hope that all parents will ensure that proper vaccines are given to their newborn children,” he told a press conference after attending the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Talk with Sabah State Government programme here today.
Yesterday, the Health Ministry announced that a three-month-old baby boy from Tuaran, Sabah was confirmed to have contracted polio, 27 years since the disease was eradicated from the country.
Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the baby had fever followed by weakness in the limbs and had been admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital before being diagnosed with vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) on Friday (December 6).
According to him, the infant was still being treated in an isolation ward and was in stable condition but still needed breathing aid. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who is I’m A Celebrity…. winner Jacqueline Jossa?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">She defeated Andrew Whyment in the final.
Jacqueline Jossa shot to fame as Lauren Branning in EastEnders, but has hit the headlines in recent years for her personal life.
The actress is married to former The Only Way Is Essex star Dan Osborne, with whom she has two daughters, Ella, four, and Mia, one.
The pair briefly split last year, less than 12 months after getting married, but reconciled after Osborne took part in Celebrity Big Brother just over a year ago.
Jossa joined EastEnders in 2010 and played the role in 2018, taking over from Madeline Duggan.
It was announced she was leaving the BBC soap in 2017, alongside her on-screen sister Lorna Fitzgerald and her last scenes aired in February 2018.
Before she went in the jungle, she said she expected her former co-stars to be surprised she was taking part.
She said: “I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat.
“I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best.”
Jossa and Osborne have been tabloid fixtures amid rumours of his infidelity.
While they were in the jungle, her campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly claimed to her that Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.
Osborne and Allen were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.
After the reports emerged, Osborne tweeted: “No matter how much they try breaking us, we are and will always remain a team. Keep smashing it in that jungle and I can not wait to see you when you get out @jacquelineMjos.”
Jossa said the most difficult part of being in I’m A Celebrity was being herself rather than acting a role, as she has never done that before.
Before she went on the show, she said: “My old colleagues on EastEnders are going to be shocked,” she said. “I don’t think they can imagine me in there. I don’t like creatures. It is not my thing.”
Asked how it would feel to win, she said: “Obviously I would love to win but you don’t go into it wanting to.
“This is one of those shows where you come out feeling proud of what you have done. If doing this programme opens doors for me then that would be so exciting.
“There are loads of things I would love to do, both acting and presenting.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A congregation of more than 100 attended the Rotary Tree of Light dedication service at St Mary’s Church, Shrewsbury.
Amongst those present were the Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire, Anna Turner; the High Sheriff Dr Josh Dixey and the Mayor Councillor Phil Gillam.
Rotarians from the three Shrewsbury Rotary clubs were joined by members of the public for the service conducted by Preb David Crowhurst, President of the Rotary Club of Church Stretton.
The Tree of Light was brought to Shrewsbury almost 30 years’ ago by former Rotarian Paul Firmin to benefit charities and good causes.
Since then the Rotary Tree of Light has raised more than £140,000 and this year’s beneficiaries will be The Samaritans, Parkinson’s and the Food Hub, all recognised as ‘deserving’ causes.
The Tree of Light presents an opportunity to make a donation of £5 or more in memory of a loved one and those wishing to donate can contact Rotarian Mike Haw on 01743 240356.
Taking part in the service were the choir Of One Accord.
The names of donors and those commemorated are displayed around the Tree and in the Shrewsbury Chronicle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Freya Anderson strikes gold with freestyle double</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Freya Anderson completed a freestyle double with victory in the 200m at the European Short Course Swimming Championships in Glasgow.
The 18-year-old Shropshire swimmer, who secured her maiden individual medal at this level and a European title with an impressive victory in the 100m freestyle on Friday, clocked a new national record of 1:52.77 in the 200m final.
That was 0.11 of a second quicker than Italy’s Federica Pellegrini, with Holland’s Femke Heemskerk taking bronze.
Ellesmere Titan Anderson then added a silver medal to her haul when she teamed up with Duncan Scott, Scott McLay and Anna Hopkin in the 4x50m freestyle final.
The British quartet finished 0.33secs behind gold medal winners Russia.
Anderson said: “It’s just amazing – I really didn’t expect it.
“Even when I touched the wall and looked around I saw the one by my name I was like ‘what!?’.
“I’m really happy with how I managed to pace my race and come back hard on the last 50m.
“I knew how a few of the others would swim it and thought if I could be with them at around the 150m mark I could make my move.
“It’s a tactical race the 200m free so I had to keep looking around whilst also focusing on my own race.
“I’ve never been good at short course and I’ve been working on my turns and skills for years, so to finally see it paying off is really rewarding. The crowd were amazing and even when I finished and looked up everyone was just so happy, it was really nice to see that.
“I saw my parents in the crowd, they weren’t here on Friday, so it was amazing to see them up there.”
Anderson was sixth with 50m left to swim, before producing a final 50m that was over a second quicker than anyone else in the race to take the title.
Timed to perfection, she overhauled Pellegrini with her final few strokes to obliterate Fran Halsall’s British record that has stood for 10 years.
The men led the relay team off, with all of their rivals taking the same approach.
Hopkin produced an outrageous swim, which would later be confirmed as the fastest female split of the race, to mean Anderson would enter the water neck and neck with her rivals.
With the two gold medals to her name already, the Ellesmere swimmer delivered a blistering anchor securing silver to the home crowd’s delight.
Anderson just missed out on another medal when she came home fourth in the 400m freestyle final.
After looking good in qualifying, Anderson swam the race in her usual style -conservative early on before finishing strongly.
Out in lane one the youngster was slightly isolated and away from the race in the centre lanes, but finished strongly to record a personal best.
She added: “I certainly didn't come into this expecting anything but I'm really happy, what more could I have asked for this week!
"I found it quite hard being in the outside lane as I couldn't really see anything that was going on, but I'm happy with a PB and with how I swam it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reputation Cost</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What’s the value of a congressional reputation? You’d think it would be pretty low these days but that doesn’t mean that legislators don’t think highly of themselves.
I bring this up in light of the oddly specific damages request in a federal defamation complaint filed in Virginia on behalf of Congressman Devin Nunes against Cable News Network.
Nunes (or at least his lawyer) asked for $435 million plus an extra $350,000 in punitive damages. You don’t often see a punitive damages request that’s less than the compensatory one but I guess the congressman was trying not to be harsh.
There’s no explanation in the suit for the damages calculation and I have no idea whether the congressman has a good case here, but let’s try to imagine that he wins and then has to prove the value of his injury. There are some fascinating issues here.
The obvious one is whether anyone thinks differently about the congressman. You either love him or hate him — there’s not a lot in between. If you call someone a thief, we agree that’s bad. If you call a politician devious, you get an argument.
So maybe CNN’s damages should be limited by the percentage of the population that thought less of Nunes after it ran its story.
As for that $435 million figure — it definitely catches the eye in news headlines and stories.
We reporter types love shiny objects and that number is a gleaming gemstone. You don’t file a boring lawsuit if you want to be noticed.
The complaint, by the way, is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. You’d think it could have been produced by a public relations team or a campaign staff. Those of you looking to improve your public profiles should study this.
There’s a lovely chart, beautiful color photos and a lengthy adoring profile of the plaintiff.  The suit gets right to the headline point with that big number up front.
Then there’s this at the beginning of the introduction: “CNN is the mother of fake news. It is the least trusted name. CNN is eroding the fabric of America, proselytizing, sowing distrust and disharmony. It must be held accountable.”
Let that passage sink in for a moment.
Here are my questions: Who is the father of fake news and how did he meet CNN? (There’s got to be a rom-com in there somewhere.)
Should you be defaming the company that you’re suing for defamation? (I know that’s OK in a lawsuit, but certain politicians say this sort of thing all the time outside of lawsuits.) Shouldn’t CNN cross-complain or sue a bunch of politicians?
How does CNN’s reputation compare financially with a congressperson’s reputation? Think about all the lawsuits that The Failing New York Times could file.
Imagine the discovery process on the issue of fake news. This could be very educational for all of us.
The hunt. Where are the witches? We’ve had nonstop witch hunts for years now and not a single witch has been indicted. Why?
I think the answer is obvious: The witches are in control. There are signs everywhere. Can you look deeply into the eyes of Adam Schiff and Devin Nunes and not realize they’ve been bewitched?
Really. Pause your television and stare at their eyes. You’ll shudder.
And what else explains our alternate realities? Is Russia really Ukraine in disguise? Is Donald Trump a man of the people or the leader of the Nazi party? How can everyone look at the same things and see different worlds?
It’s witchcraft.
I realized this after reading about yet another politician claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. Most of us assumed they were talking about overzealous prosecutors and partisans — but what if those guys aren’t the real problem? What if famous people are being hunted by witches?
There are two discussions to be had here. One — of particular interest to lawyers — is the proper way to defend witchcraft victims. The other is how to find witches and stop them.
Let’s deal with the first topic. It’s clear that the primary defenses currently in use for accused public figures are claiming to be victims of witch hunts and accusing someone else of something (anything will do). It’s the perfect-phone-call/some-people-say-you’re-a-terrible-person strategy.
In normal times, this defense could be very effective. But when you see it over and over again, it gets less convincing. We all hate watching reruns, unless the show is really good.
I suggest a plea of not guilty by reason of bewitchment. Then we might get some legitimate investigation of the American witch/warlock problem. Who are they?
It would be easy to make a joke about Nancy Pelosi or Kelly Conway but that’s too obvious and way too sexist.
No, the witches or warlocks have to be people we wouldn’t suspect but who have daily access to mass media for spellcasting.
Has anyone ever seen Ellen DeGeneres floating?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Android, Google and free content licenses. Who is to blame and what can be done?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Have you heard about bans on apps and developers in Google Play? This is just such a story. It’s also an attempt to collect similar cases into one place and offer some kind of plan of action to prevent Google’s unpredictable actions. It isn’t fair to be banned for the legal use of free material. Personally, I like the idea of content licenses such as CC BY-SA, which permits any use, including commercial. Thanks to such licenses, we developers have websites like StackOverflow, where I’ve been elected to be the moderator. Unfortunately, companies like Google don’t respect the ideas behind these licenses. Here's my story.
It all started out fine. Our app for Android was created back in 2014 and had been living quite a normal life on Google Play. The app was a client to a site with texts. Nothing special, but people liked it, especially the option to download texts to the device and read them without the Internet. The app took the texts from http://scpfoundation.net/. It’s a website for joint literary creativity within a common fictional universe, quite well-known in some circles. Originally it appeared in the US (http://www.scp-wiki.net).Then their community translated thousands of articles from English into over 10 other languages. For posterity, it is important that all the content on the sites, the original and the translated ones, is distributed under a free Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which is located at the bottom of each page. This also applies to the logo of the website indicating the license, as seen here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SCP_Foundation_ (emblem).svg on Wikipedia. The license permits any use of the material, including for commercial purposes, requiring only the indication of authorship and preservation of the original license in derivative works. This information, the source of the texts with license indication, was in both the description of the apps and in the apps themselves.
For several years everything was running normally. Initially, it was decided to make all the features of the app free and to provide the possibility of voluntary donations through in-app subscriptions. However, it hardly brought in any profit at all. As a result, it was decided to monetize the most popular features of the app, compensating for the inconvenience to users by opening the source code. We also started to release versions for languages other than Russian. The original Russian version of the app even got into the top 10 of the "news and magazines" category of Google Play. While working on this project, I sort of taught myself programming, I tried new things, I made mistakes and I learned a lot. The important thing for this article is the development process. It was necessary to parse HTML on the server and then send it through API to all the sites with translations, instead of doing a separate app for each language with parsing on the client. I know this now, but 5 years ago I had very little idea of how to write servers. At the time, it didn't make much sense to me. My thinking was that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Now I write API and plan to go onto iOS and hopefully one day return to Google Play.
Then the warning lights started flashing, one after another. First Google Play began to reject new apps for copyright infringement. It was the same code, but for a site in a different language. I believe the new versions started to get rejected in the summer of 2017. However, each time it was possible to solve the issue by contacting their technical support service, which even suggested a special form, in which you can notify Google of the release of a new app by sending them any files needed. In my case, all I had to do was provide a link to the website and state that there was a license at the bottom that allowed the use of the content. After that, Google sent a letter saying that everything was okay. We were free to spread it and they had saved our information. But apps also got deleted (I’ll talk later about the difference between removal and blocking).They’d be deleted for things like mentioning the names of other apps in the description, in particular, the name of one of the games based on the site. In theory, the license should allow it. But okay, I'm not a lawyer, maybe Google was right, and we just had to clean up what they didn’t like and move on. But then they started removing apps due to the lack of privacy policy and processing of personal data. We were not alone in this situation. The problem was extensive. It seemed to have started around 2018.The network had several generators with such agreements, which were just enough to put on the website and add a link to the description of the app. Then there was Appodeal, where the app was removed due to problems in their SDK. But my mistake was that I had used the beta version, and Appodeal honestly warned about this problem the day before removal. I just had to update the SDK to the latest stable version, but I didn’t manage to up it in time.
Then things started going wrong with Google Play’s app checks. I tried to release an update with a new version of Appodeal SDK. It was rejected for the same reason. On reflection, I decided that it was easier to just remove SDK, replacing its functionality (it was used for advertising with rewards) with similar functions from AdMob. Do you think it helped? I don’t think so! This update was also rejected. But I'm a programmer. I'm cunning. I bypassed this bug on Google Play simply and gracefully. I posted an update in the form of an alpha version and raised it to the working version. And everything was fine. For a while.
Then there was the time that our apps were removed because of violations of their advertising rules. As always, no examples, just a link to the voluminous rules for developers. After talking with their technical support service, I managed to find out that Google saw a problem with the links to my other apps in Google Play, which was just a list of similar apps in other languages. I mean, come on, I can’t give links to my own apps on the same platform? Okay Google, if you want it that bad. Here you go. I released an update with "Ad " over each button-link. Problem solved.
Then I got a letter stating, "After a recent review, SCP Foundation France On/Offline database fr (ru.dante.scpfoundation.fr) has been removed from Google Play." The French version of the app got banned. The reason given was, of all things, "Violation of Sexually Explicit Content policy." And again, nothing was said about what exactly Google had found objectionable. Perhaps, if you search really thoroughly amongst the thousands of texts, you might have found a couple of provocative images. Well, I didn’t lose heart. Google probably knows what it's doing and I'm the one to blame. I put up with the loss of the app. It had a few users, but its loss didn’t set us back too much. I began to update the rest of the apps, disabling of all images. At the same time, I began to look for information on app bans on the Internet. And then I started to suspect that this was not an accident. I wasn’t the only one in this situation. It turned out that the network has many examples of app bans and even accounts bans.
Let’s digress and talk about the moderation system in Google Play. There are two or three types of sanctions against apps, depending on what you count. First, your app can be "Removed." In this case, the app will not be available for search and download on Google Play, but you have access to it in the developer console and can release an update with fixes. This is not considered a serious violation and does not affect the status of the account. A subset of this is “Update Rejection.” In this case, the app is available for search and installation through Google Play, however, you should make changes to the planned update, as it violates something — something in the current form. Like in the first case, it does not affect the status of the account and nothing threatens you except for spoiling the mood and having some extra work to do. The last type of sanction is really bad. It’s called "Suspended" and if you see a letter from Google with this word, prepare for the worst. The app isn’t just removed from Google Play, it’s removed permanently, with a ban on updating and even viewing the description, statistics and reviews in the developer console. The scary thing here isn’t that Google makes you release a new version with a new package and re-recruit users, reviews, paying audience and explain to the users of the deleted version why everything stopped working. The scary thing is that you’ve got a label on you and the timer has started. Now you are an unreliable developer. Some people say that strikes get "rotten" after about six months. If get two more "Suspended " apps, you automatically cease to be an independent Android developer forever. Google explicitly prohibits the creation of a new developer account after the ban of the existing one and, given the market share of Google Play, the ban deprives the developer of a lot market access.
Okay, back to the main plot. About three weeks later after the aforementioned app bans, I was at another meetup listening to some reports. And then I get two messages from Google. That's right, two more apps were banned. But this time, the two main ones, the Russian and the English versions. My first thought was, "Damn, I didn’t have time to release the update with the pictures disabled." But that wasn’t the reason. Here is a quote from the letter: "After review, SCP Foundation EN Database On / Offline, ru.dante.scpfoundation.eng, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a strike policy because it violates the impersonation policy." In other words, Google decided that I was impersonating another person and using someone else's brand without permission. And here's the weird thing, all apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name were removed from the store. Except the ones I posted later, notifying Google of a free content license through the form I mentioned above. And not only were my apps removed, but other developers' apps were as well, about ten or more. I didn’t count them at the time, so I don’t know how many were removed and how many developers discovered that years of their work were thrown into a landfill by Google and their robots. Now you can’t find any apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name in Google Play, which implies that none of them managed to resolve the situation with Google.
In this case, I immediately issued appeals for both apps. I wrote that the apps use content under a free license and gave them links to the site where this is clearly written. However, in response, they wrote the following:
That means that they want me to provide them with documents confirming my right to use the content and the brand, as I understand it, both the name and the icon. They also needed the documents in the form of a response to this letter from the mail server of the site. In addition, for the Russian and English versions, they had two different domains in mind, one of which is a mirror of the second, although the Russian version did not take anything at all from these sites. They didn’t care about the presence of a free license for content that allows its use, as they never even mentioning it. Although in other apps it was enough, going by the fact that other similar apps have not been removed. Okay Google, I tried to comply with this requirement of yours. I went on scp-wiki.net’s private messaging system(like other sites with translations, it works on the Wikidot engine) and I wrote to other local administrators dealing with issues related to their content licenses. In the “Help” section of the site, it was written that they answer within a day. The first admin didn't answer me, I wrote the other one, then another, then another. I was answered by deathly silence. But I didn’t give up. Although the first panic attacks began to occur, I still hoped for a solution to the problem within a week or two. Thinking about how many subscriptions to users would be canceled in this time, I browsed the net looking for information on how to make a document that the site administrators can send to Google. It looked like this. Meanwhile, I wrote a newsletter to our users through FCM, describing the situation. With that, I built a simple page on the site.
One more digression. Let me tell you about the recent scandal in the SCP Foundation community related to content licensing, copyrights, threats, revelations and other things. I don’t know if this stems from blocking apps. I’ll just give you a list of facts and you can draw your own conclusions. It went more or less like this:
I know this individual. We’d worked together for some time, mutually advertising his artbooks and our app. But at one point we had a misunderstanding about the details of our agreement which resulted in a rather unpleasant conversation. Fortunately, we managed to resolve it. However during the conversation there were direct threats to remove the apps from the Google store due to the use of the TM.
This case was in December 2018. And blocking all apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name occurred at the end of March. After two weeks, my developer account was blocked. Apparently, this was due to the fact that I had not received a response from the administrators of the English site and already had had three strikes on the account. The next day, the owner of the TM presented his own analogue version of our app. Everything seemed to check out and the reason for the block was clear. However, in a personal conversation with the owner of the TM, he denied my assumptions about his involvement and announced his intention to withdraw the TM. Google also refused to confirm my suspicions, ignoring my questions to technical support about any claims of copyright holders and the name and logo of the apps, insisting on the connection with the original site. You can decide if there is any connection.
Update: After I started writing this article, the situation with the TM has worsened. He began to block communities in VK with its help and withdrew board games from the market. The administrators of the Russian site released a post explaining the situation and reporting that the court documents for the app were almost ready. They were also supported by the original website, which started collecting donations for legal expenses. As a result, the site administrators wrote a statement to the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. It’s also worth mentioning the position of the technical support service of VK: they completely ignored any indication of the license and ban on the communities.
But let’s get back to Google. At some point I realized that there was only one way to win back the account and apps and that was to contact the admins of the original site and ask them to send an email with the ready-made document. Nothing could be easier, right? Initially, I had my doubts. Going by what I had known about the site and its administration system, they might not have their own mail server or even a desire to help me. But those were only my fears. And the task was so simple. I just had to contact them. But that turned out to be the biggest problem. No one answered my personal messages. And when one of the admins did finally answer, he said that he was busy and would answer later. Four (!) months later, I managed to get through to the administration, which said that I was not alone in this predicament. They have tried to help others with this and failed. Google just doesn't want to hear them. And they do not have their own mail server, so there is no technical possibility to send the letter I need. So the circle has been closed.
Is this an isolated case? As I’ve mentioned above, no, it’s not. You can see for yourself by searching the web or visiting my website (https://dont-play-with-google.com/). I created it specifically to collect articles about cases of blocking apps and accounts in Google Play. Some of the articles on the site were translated into Russian, English and French with the help of my friends. Keep in mind that we are not professional translators and many articles are translated automatically and only slightly corrected. It is also possible to add new articles and translations into other languages. If you have links to other blocking cases, please, add them to the site as people should know. If you want to help the site, you can translate articles, correct typos or just code. The site consists of server and client sections. BackEnd is made on Spring (Gradle, Kotlin, Postgresql): https://github.com/mohaxspb/dont-play-with-gp-api. FrontEnd — Angular (TypeScript): https://github.com/mohaxspb/dont-play-with-gp-front. Don’t judge the code too harshly as I specialize on Android. It's funny that in the process of creating the site I even had to edit the Angular compiler (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32760). PullRequests are welcomed on any subject either bugs or new opportunities. The list of tasks for the site’s functionality can be found in Trello.
Here are just a few examples of absurd app and account bans:
In all these cases, the bans occur suddenly. The developer doesn’t receive any warnings. In many cases, one can avoid getting their ban apps or accounts banned simply by changing one line in the name of the app (as in my case) or the name of the account (as in a case from the list above). However, instead of a warning with a proposal to correct the violation, you’re just banned. And technical support either doesn’t want to help you or demands unnecessary documents. I even had a case in which an automatic email from Google about a problem with the app contained broken links. Also, there are never any specifics in automatic letters, only the indication of the violated point of very vague rules and a reference to these rules. To at least get some hint to the cause of the ban, you need to contact the technical support service. And it doesn’t always give any details, like in the case of the ban of the associated account, thereby depriving you of any opportunity to do something. Here’s another example. A person got three bans on their app, all automatic. The first two bans were later canceled by technical support due to lack of violations, but the third ban appears not to be canceled.
The worst part is that there is absolutely no way to talk to a real person, only through forms with a promise of a response by mail within 72 hours. And the mail is rumored to be answered by outsourcers from India. I've no problem with that, but as for the quality of the technical support service, I think I’ve already said enough. Compare this with Google Ads technical support. They’re on the phone, in your native language, and they’ll tell you that you need to put a comma in the text and lower the age rating. And they’ll call back from a personal mobile number to check up on you. "Is your ad okay now?" I had the opportunity to compare the Google Play service and Google Ads. It's like night and day. But how did it happen? And does Google know about this issue?
Of course they do. They even have special webinars for developers to clarify the details of the moderation system, complete with tips on how to avoid getting banned. And they conduct them in the developer’s native language. And they announce these webinars on major IT resources like habr.com, the largest Russian-language IT resource. However, if you look at the recording of the webinar, you’ll find that it was just someone reading a printout of the info available in Google Help. The Q&A was also just people reading from papers, with pre-prepared answers for prepared questions. It was all just to check a box. Google does not have any real desire to help developers. The video of the webinar has already been removed. It was here. There was also a chat in which dozens of developers, including me, tried to ask questions about blocks on our accounts and apps. We were answered with links to their rules. We were so upset, we tried to organize a Telegram chat. If you are interested in talking to colleagues about similar unfortunate events, welcome to our chat: https://t.me/android_developers_ban.
On the other hand, in local markets, Google is trying to convince everyone how amazingly organized they are at helping developers launch, distributing and support apps. For example, you read about how well everything is organized. Google Play is constantly in touch, always willing to help with advice on any matter. Help with promotion, help in general, whatever you need. It’s not just any old technical support, it’s a waking dream. But when people went to the comments section and asked how to get this access in Google Play, they were all ignored. Obviously, it was just a promotional article designed to draw developers into the store.
How did it happen that the app store, which once allowed anyone put up any app of any quality without being afraid of it getting banned, has now turned into a place where you’re terrified to post an update or even have the app on your account. Some say that bots check and can ban even unpublished apps. And you can’t delete them if someone has the app installed. There are several reasons for that, as far as I understand:
My friends told me about companies involved in the creation of apps that just embed WebView, in order to redirect advertising traffic to users. Their only goal is to push their app in the store, one way or another, and earn at least some money. If the account is blocked, they simply switch to another one. They have a lot of tools to hide their digital tracks. They can avoid bans for linked accounts and there’s even a market for selling developer accounts formed around them. It’s clear that such abuses can be fought only with the help of robots. But the wrongdoers don’t get punished, they just buy a new account for a few dollars. While ordinary developers suffer from friendly fire and lose their apps forever. Their apps are often their only source of income. But maybe these are unavoidable losses. It’s just the unavoidable result of the reliable security we enjoy on Google Play. Unfortunately, no. There’s constantly news about dozens of new malwares, viruses and other things popping up. Google can't keep users or developers safe.
What conclusion can be drawn from all this? I’m sorry to say it, especially after so many years, but my conclusion seems to be that you can no longer consider Google Play to be a reliable platform for publishing apps. Or even as a platform where you can count on a reliable source of income. And the worst part is that there are simply no alternatives, unless you publish in China where Google is banned. And after your account is deleted, you might not be able to continue earning ad revenue while you're trying to recover it; unless, of course, as per Google’s advice, you use their advertising SDK from AdMob. As soon as your app and/or account is banned, advertising in AdMob immediately becomes disabled. And it doesn't work the other way around. If you manage to restore the app/account you will have to write to AdMob technical support to restore the advertising display. You can use other advertising SDKs, but with new risks. I’ve already described a case of the failure in Google Play due to the availability of the SDK from Appodeal. The latter, by the way, also requires an account in AdMob and an app in Google Play and will seriously limit the display of ads or disable them altogether in case of problems with Google.
As you can see, if you are going to build a serious business with distribution through Google Play, you need to be prepared for the fact that you might suddenly lose it all and your only hope is a possible hype in the media. Or you need to be a company the size of Facebook, then you will have the phone number of a manager at Google and you’ll be able to solve any problem quickly and easily. And you won’t be banned for the nude photos of your app users which they placed there themselves. But if you are not Facebook, you’ll just be banned, because you violated the rules. And in this case, the developers managed to restore the app. After 3 months! But we all know that such a situation simply doesn’t happen to large companies. As indicated in the first link, the ban was for a picture which was considered too racy for Google Play. However, the developers found the exact same picture in Twitch and other big apps. That means the rules are not only vague, but also do not apply to everyone. Some developers are “more equal” than others.
So, can we improve the situation? I don’t think we can. Google is a commercial company and their goal is to make money. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. But it means that the company will try to reduce costs and increase profits. And try to avoid lawsuits. As a result, it is easier and cheaper for them to ban apps and developers automatically than to hire a huge number of specialists who will personally understand the nuances and view each app, especially since, most likely, a very small percentage of developers and apps give the bulk of the revenue to Google Play. I have not seen detailed statistics on this topic, but I think it is unlikely that the situation here is very different from the situation with another Google service: YouTube. According to this study from Pex only 0.64% of videos get more than 100,000 views. And those videos generate 81.6% of all platform views. And since videos with a small number of views do not meet the criteria for enabling monetization, YouTube can remove 99% of all videos with almost no loss in profits and significantly reducing the cost of infrastructure for their storage. Moreover, at the time of writing YouTube plans to include a clause in their rules on December 10th, 2019, in which a user can be banned if he does not make a profit. "YouTube may terminate your access to or access through your Google account to all or part of the Service if it considers that providing you with access to the Service no longer makes commercial sense." I’m sure the same situation exists in Google Play. This way they can ban 99% of developers and apps and even increase profits.And don’t even dream that the situation with technical support is better on YouTube. It’s the same story. Automatic bans, unsubscribed by bots, inability to talk to a real tech support person. Unless of course you’re one of the few who rake in significant profits for the service.
Is there any way to fix the situation? I'm not sure that's possible. Because it’s more profitable for Google to leave the situation as it is than to spend huge amounts on a solution. It seems that we developers affected by Google bots can only write articles about it over and over again, hoping that someone at Google will read and manually restore our app or account. I think you shouldn’t discount the thought that developers could unite and act as a united front to change the situation. People are wired this way. They think about such solutions when so many people face the same problem. Since I began to develop for Android, I had read articles about bans, but of course, I never thought that this would happen to me. I'm not a spammer. I don’t write viruses and in general, I am always ready to wait on Google hand and foot. And I didn’t think I would lose everything because I didn’t change one word in the name of an app, especially since the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License permits it, as far as I understand. At least I successfully uploaded two of my ten apps to the Amazon store and they didn't have any questions about them.
Here’s a list of what I think any developer should do to minimize the damage from apps and accounts getting blocked. Not to avoid the damage, but to reduce it, because no one will warn you that the Google algorithm has found a problem.
Also, I would add to this list my thoughts on how the situation could be improved by creating competition. A while back Google was obliged to provide a choice of search engine at the first Android launch. It would be logical to oblige Google to also offer a choice of app store. Competition could emerge this way and, perhaps, Google would start to provide technical support on the phone (like in Russia, where Google has a strong competitor, Yandex) and stop automatic bans and let bots only be used for giving advice to moderators. Many problems could also be solved by changing the practice of banning without warning, so that the developer has the opportunity to fix something. Sometimes it is enough to change one word in the title to stay in good standing with the Google Play moderation system.
I don’t really believe I can do anything alone to improve the situation, but I won’t forgive myself if I didn’t try something, such as writing this article. Not expecting much, I sent an appeal to the FAS, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. Please note, I am not a lawyer or a writer. I'm a programmer. So my application must be rather informal and generally naive, because it seems only the state can protect developers from Google.
If you are also not satisfied with the current situation, please do the same. I am sure that things will improve if the app market on Android gets healthy competition between stores.
And finally, I would like to try to reach out to Google (in case someone from the company reads this article) and ask them to do something. For example:
I would be very happy if Google restored my apps and account, because I’ve invested a lot of work in them for more than five years. I hope at least someone will hear me. I hope that one day Google will be able to configure the moderation system so that developers will be safe from the situation when one day they find that themselves thrown out of the market by some program by a ridiculous mistake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five dead as volcano erupts in New Zealand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five people have been killed and many more are missing after a volcanic island in New Zealand erupted in a tower of ash and steam while dozens of tourists were exploring the moon-like surface.
The site on White Island was still too dangerous hours later for police and rescuers to search for the missing.
Police deputy commissioner John Tims said the number of those who remained missing was in double figures but he could not confirm an exact number.
He said there were fewer than 50 people on the island and 23 had been taken off, including the five dead.
Mr Tims said experts had told them the island remained unstable but search and rescue teams wanted to get back as quickly as they could.
He said there had been no contact with any of those who were missing.
Mr Tims said both New Zealanders and overseas tourists were among those who were dead, missing or injured.
He said most of the 18 who survived were injured and some had suffered severe burns.
A spokesman for the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said they are seeking "further information" from authorities.
He said: "We are in close contact with the New Zealand authorities following the volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island and are seeking further information."
Some of those involved were guests from the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.
"A number of our guests were touring the island today," the company said.
"We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers."
The cruise ship, which had left from Sydney last week, was scheduled to sail to the capital Wellington on Monday night but the company said it would instead remain in the Tauranga port overnight until it learned more on the situation.
Michael Schade posted video of the eruption on Twitter, saying: "My god. My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it. Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable."
His video showed a wall of ash and steam around the island and a helicopter badly damaged and covered in ash.
He said one woman was badly injured but seemed "strong" by the end.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was travelling to the region late on Monday.
She said the incident was "very significant", adding: "All our thoughts are with those affected."
Brad Scott, a volcanologist with research group GNS Science, said the eruption sent a plume of steam and ash about 12,000ft into the air.
He said it had also affected the whole of the White Island crater floor.
The GeoNet agency, which monitors volcanoes and earthquakes in New Zealand, at first raised its alert level to four, on a scale where five represents a major eruption.
It later dropped the alert level back down to three.
Mr Scott said that was because the eruption was not sustained beyond the initial blast.
White Island sits about 50 kilometres (30 miles) offshore from mainland New Zealand.
Already people are questioning why tourists were still able to visit the island after scientists recently noted an increase in volcanic activity.
GeoNet raised the alert level on White Island from one to two on November 18, noting an increase in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas, which originates from magma deep in the volcano.
It also said at the time that over the previous weeks, the volcanic tremor had increased from weak to moderate strength.
Mr Scott said the alert level was often raised and then later dropped again without any eruption.
He said there had not been any major incidents with tourists visiting the island in the past, although there had been some close calls.
Mr Scott said it was not for him to say whether the island was safe enough to host tourists immediately before Monday's eruption.
Ms Ardern said the focus remained on the search and rescue mission for now and questions about whether tourists should be visiting would be addressed later.
"In the scheme of things, for volcanic eruptions, it is not large," said Ken Gledhill, from GeoNet.
"But if you were close to that, it is not good."
White Island is north east of the town of Tauranga on North Island, one of New Zealand's two main islands.
Police were asking people to avoid areas on the North Island that were close to the eruption, including the Whakatane Heads and Muriwai Drive areas.
GeoNet said White Island is New Zealand's most active cone volcano and about 70% of the volcano is under the sea.
Twelve people were killed on the island in 1914 when it was being mined for sulphur.
Part of a crater wall collapsed and a landslide destroyed the miners' village and the mine itself.
The remains of buildings from another mining enterprise in the 1920s are now a tourist attraction, according to GeoNet.
The island became a private scenic reserve in 1953 and daily tours allow more than 10,000 people to visit the volcano every year.
The island is also known by the indigenous Maori name Whakaari.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year's annual "WestJet Christmas Miracle" video showcases families as they decide whether to give or receive.
The video was filmed at a Christmas market in Toronto where guests were given the opportunity to enter a giant Santa hat.
The video showcases a holographic Blue Santa along with Ebenezer Scrooge as they let families decide to give away or walk away with the gifts they find.
“The conversation around giving and receiving is a powerful one, and this year’s video finds inspiration in both sides of the story,” said Richard Bartrem, WestJet vice-president of marketing communications.
“The authentic reactions and emotions ... make this year’s Christmas Miracle truly heartwarming.”
The gifts included a $2,500 WestJet gift card, beach vacations and more, and the choice was left up to the people to either keep the gift or give it to a family with sick children who are staying at a Ronald McDonald House.
Touching moments were captured, and Santa made it clear there were no wrong answers.
Those who gave away their gifts were invited to a celebration at the Ronald McDonald House in Hamilton, Ont.
"For over 10 years, our incredible partners at WestJet have helped us keep families from across Canada close together during a very difficult time in their lives,” said Cathy Loblaw, CEO of RMHC Canada.
“We are so humbled by the generosity of Canadian families who chose to donate their gifts to Ronald McDonald House families this holiday season, giving them the greatest gift of all – family.”
The magical holographs in the video were created by ARHT Media Inc.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Thomson has made it official.
Widely rumoured not to be seeking re-election in the next provincial election, Thomson issued a statement Monday confirming so.
“Today, I want to thank my family, colleagues, constituents, and volunteers who have supported me since I first ran to become a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.
“Serving as the MLA for Kelowna-Mission has been the experience of a lifetime, and an absolute honour. However, I have decided that I will not be standing for re-election in the next provincial election. It is now time to pass the torch to the next generation of leadership in Kelowna-Mission.
“Having served as a government minister, a member of the Treasury Board, and even briefly as Speaker of the House, I look forward to sharing everything I have learned in over a decade in politics with those who will put their names forward to seek to represent this great community.
“Thank you again to everyone who supported or accompanied me on this incredible journey. It has been an honour to serve the people of Kelowna-Mission all these years. I look forward to continuing to work hard for the community and for the province until the next election and beyond.”
Thomson, a BC Liberal, was first elected in 2009 and was re-elected in 2013 and 2017. He served as Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and Minister of Agriculture and Lands.
Prior to entering politics, he was executive director of the BC Agriculture Council and general manager of the BC Fruit Growers Association.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA shown in design sketches ahead of this week's debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mercedes-Benz published a design sketch on its social media channels to preview the second-generation GLA crossover. The model is scheduled to make its debut online on December 11.
The sketch picks up where the last batch of teaser images left off. Don't pay attention to the huge wheels; they're not headed to production. The rest looks fairly accurate. The next GLA is taller and more SUV-like than the outgoing model, it's about half an inch shorter, and it looks like it's better proportioned. While we haven't seen the front end yet, earlier spy shots suggest it wears a sharper design. It falls in line with the design language seen recently on the firm's other compacts.
The similarities continue inside. In a separate post, Mercedes released an image that shows part of the model's cockpit. The air vents, the digital instrument cluster, and the steering wheel are the same units you'll find inside the firm's other compacts. The MBUX infotainment system will be offered, too.
The GLA shares more than styling cues and interior parts with the second-generation CLA, the first A-Class sedan, the seven-seater GLB, and the minivan-esque B-Class sold in Europe. All of these models ride on a front-wheel drive architecture that can be upgraded with 4Matic all-wheel drive. Like most of its siblings, the GLA will get a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder as its entry-level engine. Mercedes will add more powerful turbo fours (including a 416-horsepower unit that will power the flagship GLA 45), and a plug-in hybrid model could join the range a few years into the production run.
The next GLA will break cover on the Mercedes Me media platform the firm launched in 2017 at 2 p.m. CET on Dec. 11, which is 8 a.m. in New York and 5 a.m. in Los Angeles. It will be the first time Mercedes introduces a car exclusively online. There won't be an unveiling event organized for the media, and executives purposely chose to step well out of the auto show circuit. It's a move that saves a significant amount of money while drawing attention to the Mercedes Me platform.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India gang-rape shootings revives extrajudicial killing fears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: The shooting of four gang-rape and murder suspects by Indian police has highlighted the scourge of extrajudicial killings in a nation grappling with high levels of sexual crimes and a notoriously slow judicial process.
Authorities claimed the four men were killed in a “shootout” during a re-enactment of the attack, carried out just under two weeks ago, in which a 27-year-old veterinarian was raped and murdered, before her body was burnt.
Police were feted with rose petals, and crowds took to the streets cheering the men’s deaths, saying “swift justice” had been meted out.
“The law has done its duty,” local police chief VC Sajjanar told reporters.
These kind of deaths — dubbed “encounters” in South Asia — where police claim suspects were killed trying to resist arrest or while escaping from custody, are part of a well-worn script trotted out by authorities.
But human rights campaigners warned of a deepening culture of impunity as police take the law into their own hands.
“Over the decades extrajudicial killings and custodial torture have assumed legal sanctity in India,” leading Supreme Court lawyer and founder of the Human Rights Law Network, Colin Gonsalves, told AFP.
“It’s worrying that criminality of the police is now getting public approval.”
After the killings, Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde of the Supreme Court said he had concerns about the use of “instant” justice.
“Justice never ought to be instant. Justice must never ever take the form of revenge. I believe justice loses its character when it becomes revenge,” Bobde said at an event on Saturday.
The “staged shootouts” were for decades used to bypass India’s cumbersome judicial processes when police battled armed separatist movements in West Bengal, Punjab, Kashmir and remote northeastern states.
More recently, the encounters have been deployed against those accused of violent crimes.
In India’s film-loving culture, “encounter specialist” police officers have been idolised by Bollywood.
Scores of movies depict them as tough men and glorify their “kills”, particularly relating to the deaths of hundreds of alleged gang members in Bollywood’s capital Mumbai in the 1990s.
Rights activists say “encounters” are carried out as retribution by police, or used to cover up botched investigations, win awards and rewards, or to pacify a furious public.
According to a government report, 100 suspects were killed in police custody in 2017. None of the 33 policemen arrested for the killings was convicted, it said.
Campaigners say the number of those who actually die at the hands of the police is far higher, with many deaths categorised as suicide or from natural causes.
The Supreme Court attempted to clamp down on the killings in 2014, ordering mandatory probes and barring governments from rewarding officers before determining how and why the shootings occurred.
The court is currently monitoring probes into cases from northeastern Manipur state where rights groups allege that 1,530 suspects have been killed by police since 2007.
It is also hearing a petition on the “staged killings” of at least 58 suspects in Uttar Pradesh since 2017 after the state government adopted what it called “no-mercy” tactics to battle crime.
Home Minister Amit Shah has said his government would not tolerate police atrocities. He himself was cleared of charges relating to the 2005 extrajudicial killing of a gangster and his wife when he was Gujarat state’s home minister.
Police have long been criticised for not preventing violent crimes or for failing to bring cases, particularly sexual assaults, to the courts.
The justice system is also cumbersome and slow, with some rape and murder cases taking years or even decades to reach their conclusion.
India has a backlog of some 30 million cases, of which nearly 150,000 relate to sexual assault.
The conviction rate for rape stands at 32 per cent, and victims also have to endure bungled police investigations and threats by perpetrators.
Analysts say the lack of justice for victims has fuelled public acceptance of extrajudicial executions.
Activist Mihir Desai said rape cases have become symbolic of the rot in the criminal justice system, where constitutional rights of both victims and offenders are violated.
“This somehow reflects the justice delivery system and how the state is failing its citizens,” said Desai, whose rights group the People’s Union for Civil Liberties has mounted several court cases against arbitrary police killings.
“The young woman didn’t get justice and the slain men won’t get it too.”

Adding Personal Perspective To Interactive Travel Literature
Wanderlust Travel Stories is an anthology of interactive travel literature we published in fall 2019, and it’s the first release of our small studio called Different Tales. Before going indie, my business partner Jacek and I worked in lead roles on both AAA and mobile titles, and applying the things we learned over the last dozen years to our own product was an experience both fascinating and humbling.
In this article, I’ll share how we used context and personal perspective to make choices relevant for the player and easier to implement.
In May 2018 we decided to make a story game about travel. We wanted to keep it real, introspective and minimalistic.
To make a game grounded in real experiences we took on board a team of travel journalists, writers, and anthropologists, and put a lot of effort into research, interviews, photographic documentation, etc. This gave us a solid framework for the story, but also limited the possible choice-space.
We wanted to show not the, sometimes boring, logistics of travel but, above all, the feelings and emotions of a traveler. To do this we constructed a cast of characters representing very different ideas about traveling and wrote a collection of stories from their personal perspectives—a kind of interactive memoirs.
Wanderlust Travel Stories is a literary experience, and we made sure nothing distracts you away from the text. The static photos and illustrative soundscapes are there just to bring back memories or stir your imagination. The user interface is also very basic, its most important elements are stress, fatigue, and mood—showing the emotional state of the character and its influence on the story. This mechanism is described in the next sections of this text.
In the heart of every good scene is a dilemma the hero must face. By observing the hero in action we learn who they really are. The action changes the situation and creates consequences, often resulting in another dilemma.
What makes games unique, is that the designers set up a dilemma, but it is the player who makes the decision and is responsible for who the hero turns out to be. To make an informed choice the player has to be able to imagine possible outcomes. In well-written stories, the player can also compare the projected consequences with what really happened, and learn.
If this topic interests you, I wholeheartedly recommend John Yorke’s book Into the Woods, on how the learning process in our brain coexist with and shapes the stories we tell.
If we stick to the above-mentioned rules, every scene should include such elements:
If we want to make the story interactive, the first thing that usually comes to mind is to present more options. But they branch into many consequences, exponentially exploding the story tree. There are many industry standards to deal with the problem (ex. this great article by Emily Short), and we knew that we needed something very streamlined. Our time, budget and research, gave us a very tight set of constraints. We decided to focus less on shaping the world, and more on experiencing it.
That brings us to a crucial element of any decision-making process: context. Do you want a glass of water? There are two simple ways to answer, to default options: yes and no. Yet the answer would heavily depend on whether you are in a desert, dying of thirst, or on an important meeting, and really needing to go to the loo. There are moments when the context is everything.
So, we decided to highlight the subjective and personal nature of travel, to modify and multiply rather the contexts than the options. To do this, we reached for emotions.
As many travelers would tell you, sometimes the world is what it is, but usually emotions color the perception. When tired or stressed you experience the world differently.
Wanting to show how stress and fatigue influence how we feel about the places we visit, we implemented a very simple emotional simulator. It was based on a model described in Christophe André’s book about moods called "Les États d'âme : Un apprentissage de la sérénité."
We simplified the model a bit, and this is how it works in Wanderlust Travel Stories:
The player’s decisions, apart from branching the story from time to time, usually influenced stress and fatigue. The resulting mood was being fed back to the story, modifying the context of every following decision.
The idea was to have every scene opening and summary written in at least three (up to nine) versions, reflecting the character’s possible moods. The more important the scene was to the main story arc, the higher emotional fidelity it had. Additionally, some options were available only in certain moods. We did not always manage to do that, but that was what we aimed for.
As an example, I chose a scene in Paris, one that is not spoilery and designed well enough to dissect in the public. Our hero steps off the train and has his first experience with the capital of France. What he sees and what options are available depends on his stress and fatigue.
The way players approach the available options, depends on the context they were given, or at least that was the idea behind the design.
When the character is peaceful, he sees Paris “as it is,” just another European city near a train station. The main choice in this scene is how to proceed, whether to take a taxi or walk. Because Tomek is fatigued, an extra option appears “I was hungry.” We can expect that most players will eat something (to regain some strength) and then decide whether to walk or call a taxi.
The situation changes when the character is hopeless. High stress and high fatigue render the world hostile, and the character focus on possible dangers: drunks, shouting, a reeking dumpster. The main call-a-taxi-or-walk choice remains the same, and there are two extra options: “I was hungry,” and “I needed a drink,” the later triggered by high stress. Eating is still a valid option gameplay-wise, but in the presence of a smelly dumpster, many players lose their appetite and just call a taxi to get out of that awful place.
When a character is calm the place looks normal and the choice boils down to picking the best way to proceed. Curious players will probably take a walk, while the “optimizers” would probably call a taxi to save their strength for the future.
An optimistic character sees the city in its most glamorous form, full of light and excitement. It looks inviting, making the taxi seem like a less interesting choice.
The graph of the scene looks like this:
As far as the branching goes, the situation is quite simple—we make a decision, and at the end of the scene we either walk down one branch or sit in a taxi going down another branch of the story tree. Sometimes there are extra diversions available, in the form of short scenes in a bar and/or in a bistro, but they feed back to the main choice.
But when we look at the mood-dependent contexts, the situation gets more interesting. Although the number of outcomes stays the same, the number of personal situations framing the decision multiply. Taking a taxi to escape a hostile environment is a different decision than giving up on an otherwise alluring walk to save strength for another day. A quick snack before a night stroll is something different than a forced meal in a dive near a smelly dumpster.
We learned the nuances of this technique as we went, so not all instances you’ll find in the game, work perfectly, but we found it a great production tool. It allowed us to save on extensive (and expensive) branching we were prone to, and to keep the story within our research-based limits, while allowing for extensive personalization of the events. We set most scenes in the mood-depending context, and as a result, the number of personal decision-making situations available to players became much higher than the actual scene count.
The mood simulator was just a specific, and the most universal, case when we used variables to personalize the story. In short, it worked like this: the main decision in a scene branched the story, but some of the decisions also changed a variable value (be it fatigue, the strength of a relationship with another character, or just noting that a certain event took place). The variable then fed back to scenes down the story-tree, no matter which of the branches we explored.
We used this simple and effective mechanism both to personalize small details of the stories and to decide about the outcomes of whole character arcs.
The details can be as small as whether Henriette is a tea or a coffee person. The first choice the player makes about their favorite beverage reflects on the whole long sailing to Antarctica—with a steaming cup of tea (or coffee) in hand. Sometimes the changes are about people. Depending on how the player directs Adília’s relation with her husband, she talks about him using his name “Jose” or coldly calls him “the husband.” The mechanism is crucial in the story’s finale, when the available options that shape Adília’s future, are gated by variables reflecting her relationships with various people in her life.
We wanted to tell stories that were real and personal, and we knew that we would be working in a small team and within the limits set by our research. Those factors advised against extensive branching of the story (which was our first idea), yet we wanted to keep the experience varied among different players, and we wanted it to feel personal.
The solution we reached for, was to use the player’s decision points not only to branch the story but also to set different variables, which then fed back to the following scenes, modifying them to reflect how the player directed the character.
The most universal and crucial of the variables, were stress and fatigue, which we used to track the mood of the characters. The mood then influenced how surroundings were described, providing changing and personal context for every decision. Thanks to this, using a limited number of story branching points, we aimed to create a significantly higher number of unique decision situations.
We learned how to use the mechanisms as the production progressed, so the implementation is not perfect, but we believed the idea was interesting enough to share it with you.
If you have similar (or totally different) experiences from your productions, I would love to share stories.
And, while you're here, you might be interested in my post on Slow Gaming, a philosophy we try to put in motion in our games.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BuzzFeed UK has been told it will be dissolved in two months if it fails to file its accounts with Companies House.
The warning comes after the online media organisation missed a deadline at the end of September to submit its financial information for 2018.
On Monday, a “First Gazette” notice was issued for a compulsory strike-off.
The notice says: “The Registrar of Companies gives notice that, unless cause is shown to the contrary, the company will be struck off the register and dissolved not less than two months from (December 10).”
Julie Palmer, insolvency expert at Begbies Traynor, said: “Receiving a notice like this is more common than you might think, but it’s not often a cause for concern without any clear reasons behind it.”
These could include extending the company’s accounting period, although Companies House must still be informed, and most experts agree an accounting extension is typically a sign of financial difficulties.
The period covered in the late BuzzFeed UK accounts covers a difficult year for the business, with revenues failing to match expectations.
In January this year, founder and chief executive Jonah Peretti announced that 15% of the workforce worldwide would be laid off to cut costs.
It came weeks after UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson stepped down after three-and-a-half years in charge and followed calls from staff to unionise.
BuzzFeed, which was launched in the US in 2006, attempted a major overseas expansion in recent years. But it subsequently retrenched, along with cutting back its US operations.
Despite heavy cuts to its UK workforce, it has managed to bag some major scoops and awards, including being named news website of the year in 2018.
BuzzFeed UK also uncovered a series of troubling deaths of Russians in the UK, leading to the reopening of police investigations, and reporters also exposed a series of issues at the Department of Justice.
A spokeswoman for BuzzFeed UK said accounts would be filed “soon” but declined to specify.
In 2017 the business made a pre-tax loss of £1.9 million on turnover of £33.4 million, although the accounts said it continues to be financially supported by its US parent company.
In 2016 it made a pre-tax loss of £3.3 million on revenues of £20.5 million.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'A name that slams you' - Francois Modesto's pride at Nottingham Forest role and looking for players</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nottingham Forest technical director Francois Modesto says travelling around the country in his car, watching games, helps give him an idea of the type of players to recruit.
And he has spoken of his pride at working for “such a mythical club” as the Reds.
The Frenchman’s appointment was confirmed by the club in October - along with head of international recruitment Jose Anigo - though the pair are understood to have already been working at the City Ground for some time before then.
Modesto played a key role in Forest’s summer transfer business, as well as the arrival of head coach Sabri Lamouchi.
And to help him adapt to the Championship, he spent time getting to know the league by going up and down the country watching games.
Asked how he came to understand what is a new division for him, Modesto told So Foot: “It’s simple. I left alone with my car to see matches in the Premier League, Championship and League One to understand this football.
“Seeing it on TV is fine, but living it on a daily basis is something else.
“Here you can go to a match every day.
“Being on the ground is important, because you meet people, opposing clubs, mentality. You feel things, you impregnate yourself and then you can ask yourself to choose the players to recruit.
“It was very important to come six months before, as an observer, to understand what is happening and to adapt. I'm coming to a foreign country, you have to respect that.
“You must not change everything. I always say that when you are a foreign player, you have to adapt to the country, it is not the country that has to adapt to us. It's the same as a leader now.
“I have to adapt to the people, the football and the club here, bringing our foreign touch that can perhaps improve some things.”
The former Olympiacos chief scout represented the likes of Monaco, Cagliari, Bastia and the Greek giants during his playing career.
And he says he never imagined himself one day travelling around England in his car to look for players.
“Never. But I believe a lot in destiny,” he said.
“I remember when I was little, I must have been about 10 years old, I had seen an English League Cup final, which Nottingham Forest had won.
“It was a match that marked me because at the time, few games were broadcast.
“In addition, when you're young, Nottingham Forest is a name that slams you. And at that time, the finals of the League Cup, I did not see many. It is Nottingham that I saw, not Liverpool, Manchester or I do not know which club.”
Asked for what he thinks when he takes to the road in England, Modesto said: “I think I was a boy from Bastia who was born into a very average family, who did not think he could one day end up in England in such a mythical club.
“I'm proud of it. It's a pride for me and for the name of my family to be here. It's beautiful.
“There is everything to do to win this bet. But it's the beauty of football, which gives a lot of life possibilities.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">4-year-old twins free selves, climb to safety after dad dies in car crash</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SEATTLE (AP/Gray News) — Washington state authorities say 4-year-old twins freed themselves from their car seats and climbed an embankment seeking help following a car crash that killed their father.
KING-TV reported 47-year-old Corey Simmons of Langley died when the vehicle with his daughters in the backseat crashed into trees and down the embankment on Whidbey Island around 6 p.m. Friday.
Family members say the girls released themselves from their car seats and crawled out of the car before climbing about 200 feet (61 meters) up to the road after the accident 34 miles (55 kilometers) north of Seattle.
Police say the girls were transported to a hospital with minor injuries after an unidentified woman passing in her car went back to help and called 911.
Trooper Heather Axtman, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Patrol, described the area as very rural and said the chances that anyone would drive by and see the girls “was truly the right time at the right place” type of thing, according to CNN.
“We are so incredibly thankful," said Rebecah Crider, sister to the twin girls and Simmons’ stepdaughter. "We would love to personally meet her and thank her.”
The twins’ mother, Esther Crider, said the girls are traumatized by what happened, KING reports.
Axtman called the girls “extremely heroic and brave," noting how they were so young but able to find their way from the crash in the cold and dark, according to CNN.
“The bravery that these two little girls showed was incredible,” she said.
Authorities say Simmons was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash. The accident is under investigation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Fury strips off to tease his bulging muscles in cheeky snap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Fury marked the start of his sizzling spa day by stripping off for a half-naked snap.
The Love Island runner up, 21, left little to the imagination as he shared a cheeky photo with his 2.9 million Instagram followers on Sunday afternoon.
The professional boxer appeared to be enjoying a relaxing day in the spa, and it seems he wanted to show off his extremely toned physique and bulging muscles - sending pulses racing.
The hunky reality star is currently preparing for his highly-anticipated return to the ring after he took to social media to announce his comeback fight with a video captioned: "Are you ready 21.12.19."
The fight, with his opponent still unknown, will take place at the Copper Box Arena in London on 'The Fight Before Christmas' card on BT Sport.
Tommy's latest snap proves the TV star has been training hard in the gym with his chiseled six pack, defined shoulders and huge biceps stealing the photo's attention.
He captioned the snap, writing: "Spa nights."
The handsome star's Love Island girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague complimented her beau's recent snap with a hint of PDA as she took to Instagram to post on his pic.
Teasing her approval of Tommy's snap, the blonde bombshell, 20, replied: "Wowwww."
Meanwhile, Tommy's saucy snap also caught the attention of his fellow Love Island contestant Michel Griffiths.
The former firefighter, 28, recognised Tommy's gym success, commenting: "Abs coming through there son."
Tommy's post-Love Island schedule has been hectic, with the star also busy filming for The Boxer & the Ballroom Dancer, alongside best pal Curtis Pritchard .
Love Island 2019's favourite mates have teamed up for a new spin-off of the hit ITV2 show which sees the boys switch their day jobs, and it will consist of three 60-minute episodes which highlight their unbreakable bromance.
Curtis, 23, will put on the boxing gloves as Tommy learns to cut some moves on the dancefloor.
As a surprise, their girlfriends Maura Higgins and Molly-Mae will star in the series along the way as they root for their boyfriends with support.
*The Boxer & the Ballroom Dancer will air on ITV2 later this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Danielle Zarb-Cousin splits from Jonny Mitchell and cancels wedding amid cheating fears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Danielle Zarb-Cousin has dumped her Love Island fiance Jonny Mitchell just 10 months before their proposed wedding, over fears he cheated on her.
The heartbroken bride, 28, shared a poignant video of herself being fitted for her beautiful wedding dress as she revealed their nearly two-year romance is over.
Weeks after having gushed about her excitement for their big day in September 2020, Danielle spoke of her heartache.
"It isn't just cancelling a wedding, it's saying goodbye to the vision you had for the rest of your life after that day," she wrote.
"The venue, the laughter, the family members and the start of a journey with someone who you love and who will love you for the rest of your life, no matter what, for better or worse. The places you would live and the things you would see together."
She went on: "I am not posting this for sympathy but for my own closure. I’m saying goodbye to the girl in this dress, I’m saying goodbye to her for good. It's been pretty traumatising for me having to come to terms with everything lol but I'm only looking forward from now on. God has a different plan for my life - I hope the next chapter is the best one yet."
As fans flocked to ask what went wrong, Danielle returned to her caption to add: "The details are between Jonny & I. We have some amazing beautiful memories together which I will always cherish and I wish him nothing but happiness and success with everything he does in his life."
But a pal told Mirror Online Danielle had been worried that Jonny, also 28, had been cheating on her behind her back.
"She's utterly heartbroken. She's already moved out of the home they bought together," said the source.
"She had to cancel the wedding - they couldn't go on like this. She's done with their relationship, there's no hope of a reconciliation whatsoever.
"He's just not the man she thought he was."
The couple found love in February 2018, after Jonny's messy split from Stephanie Pratt.
Danielle, who was previously in a relationship with TOWIE's Elliott Wright, confirmed they were engaged in December last year, after Jonny popped the question during a romantic break in Switzerland.
"It sounds clichè, but I knew from the first time I met this girl that I was going to marry her," Jonny wrote on Instagram to announce the news.
"I probably would've proposed to her within the first month of knowing her if it wasn't totally weird! She's basically the girl version of me and gets me in every way humanly possible.. She's a beautiful, caring soul inside and out."
Since their split, believed to be at the end of November, Jonny has been sharing snaps of himself lapping up the sun in Bali and boarding a private jet.
"My ideal New years' resolution 2020: 1. Jet off to a remote island in the middle of nowhere. 2. Never come back," he wrote cryptically earlier this month.
Mirror Online has contacted Jonny's rep for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jacqueline Jossa and Dan Osborne get very close hours after jungle win despite threesome slurs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jacqueline Jossa and her hunky husband Dan Osborne looked super cosy on the beach after she was crowned the Queen of the Jungle.
The pair shrugged off all circulating rumours of Dan's infidelity to his former EastEnders actress wife.
Former Towie star Dan, 28, was pictured making his wife, 27, laugh while he goes in for a hug after the pair were apart for three weeks.
They enjoyed some family time with their children on a very crowded and busy beach.
Jac looked stunning in a frilly floral print dress and her long brunette hair falling over her shoulders, while Dan got his abs out and went shirtless to show off his tattooed body.
He was seen cupping her face in one snap and leaning in towards her for what looks like a cheeky kiss.
It comes after the couple - who have been married just over two years - faced trouble after threesome slurs.
Model Chloe Ayling came forward to say she had a threesome with Dan and CBB star Natalie Nunn after a wild night out.
The model said she wanted to confess because she felt bad for Dan's wife Jacqueline who will be unaware of the new claims.
She claimed to The Sun that after a night of boozing and partying - which saw the stars papped together - they went back to a hotel and engaged in sexual activity together.
Chloe claims that she watched Dan have full sex with Natalie, who was married to Jacob at the time, before kissing and performing a sex act on Chloe.
Dan has also faced a number of cheating claims in the past, including rumours that he hooked up with former Love Island babe Gabby Allen , but he has always protested his innocence, as has Gabby.
It has also been reported that Myles told Jacqueline in unaired scenes that he believed something had happened between his ex-girlfriend Gabby and Dan.
He recently told us: "I've got nothing to worry about.
"Listen, she is my wife, I have got nothing to think about. I am just coming out to support her and that is the only reason I am here.
"I am just excited to see her and the last person on my mind is Myles [Stephenson] or anyone else. I have got nothing to say to him or anything else, only my wife."

    <h5 class="mb-1">EastEnders confirms first look at Lee Carter return as disaster strikes Walford</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EastEnders has confirmed details about Lee Carter's big return to Walford, over two years on from his exit from the BBC soap.
Actor Danny Hatchard is reprising the role for a guest stint, as part of on-screen mum Linda Carter's devastating new storyline.
Linda's battle with alcohol will escalate in the coming scenes, leaving her in danger - and leaving her family including husband Mick distraught.
As she continues to act out, unable to stop drinking, she ends up clashing with residents including Ruby Allen.
But when the character goes missing, her family including son Lee are worried.
On Christmas Eve, Linda will head out of the pub to the Square gardens where she drinks alone.
Falling asleep in the freezing conditions, will she be okay?
It comes after Mick's attempts to stop his wife drinking leave her exploding at him.
The following day she hits rock bottom, while it's clear she doesn't return to the pub as the Carters panic.
As the day goes on with Linda nowhere to be seen, her family grow seriously worried for her.
Lee makes his return unaware of the unfolding situation at first, making his comeback for the festive period.
But events soon take their toll, with Mick suffering from a panic attack.
Recent spoilers confirmed Linda would "spiral dangerously out of control" this Christmas, leaving her in a desperate situation.
There was also pictures from filming on location, that appeared to show the character being kidnapped by Martin Fowler, who was shown waving a gun around.
No details about the storyline have been confirmed, so viewers will have to stay tuned.
EastEnders airs Mondays an Fridays at 8pm, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa had it in the bag from day five, according to her campmate Roman Kemp.
Roman finished in third place on the series on Sunday, with Jacqueline being crowned Queen of the Jungle.
But it was no surprise to Roman that the EastEnders star went all the way to victory.
In fact, he predicted it on day five and secretly told Jacqueline she could win it after she considered quitting the show.
After a "wobble" in camp, with the first few days being extremely tough, Roman urged her to stay in the jungle.
Speaking on Lorraine on Monday morning, Roman confessed: "I said to her from day five!
"She had a bit of a wobble and was missing home. She'd come back from Snake Rock and had been sleeping on the floor.
"I gave her a hug and pulled her aside, cos I didn't want the others to hear, and I whispered in her ear, 'If you can stay you’ll win it, you will'."
Roman then confessed that when the winner was announced, the pair looked at each other with him telling her "I told you".
It comes after the news that Jacqueline has skipped all live TV interviews in the wake of her win.
Jacqueline has chosen to spend time with her family, amid filming with ITV for the Coming Out show this week.
A source close to Jacqueline told Mirror Online: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.
"Jacqueline and Dan spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."
Runner-up Andy Whyment also discussed Jacqueline's win on the show, sharing she had a "tough time" in the jungle.
Andy commented that she was doing "fine" since arriving back at the hotel, pleased for her taking the crown.
I'm A Celebrity's Coming Out show airs Thursday night at 9pm on ITV.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Comic Peter Kay is reportedly speaking to BBC bosses about a project which will see him return to our screens.
Since the final episode of his show Car Share aired last year, Peter, 46, has taken a break from performing.

It was due to be his first tour in eight years, and Peter did not explain the exact reason, only asking for privacy.
But now The Sun has reported that he is discussing his big comeback.
A TV source said: “A conversation has been had between Peter and the BBC. There is no rush and whatever happens will always be dictated by Peter but a new project has been discussed.
“It’s exciting news for Peter’s fans, who have yet to see the void left by Car Share filled.”
Kay has had a profitable 12 months despite taking a break from TV and showbiz.
The Bolton comedian has barely been seen in public over the past year but his latest published accounts show that he has been coining it in without having to perform.
Peter seen his businesses continue to flourish, earning millions in the past year even though he hasn't worked much during the period.
In total, the accounts show that Kay has amassed a fortune of £32million in cash and investments through his companies.

Another of his production companies, Hussein Traders Limited, has a huge £8.3m sat in the bank through available monies and investments.
He surprised his fans by announcing a special screening of Phoenix Nights in 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I thought I was on the golf course' - Ex-Aberdeen and Celtic star Gary Mackay-Steven opens up on River Kelvin drama</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Celtic and Aberdeen winger Gary Mackay-Steven has revealed he had no idea where he was when he woke up in hospital after plunging into the River Kelvin two years ago.
Mackay-Steven fell into the river during a night out in Glasgow. He jumped over a wall and slipped, spending close to an hour in the water in the early hours of the morning before being taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
The 29-year-old, now playing for New York City FC in Major League Soccer in the USA, told the Football Daft podcast that he was convinced he was either on a golf course, or on Aberdeen's Union Street.
Speaking to podcast hosts David Tanner and wrestler Graeme "Grado" Stevely, Mackay-Steven recalled the incident but said he was unsure what caused his confusion.
"The nurse came through and said, 'all the checks are good - you can get out, but you just need to tell me where you are'.
"I said, 'yeah, no problem, the golf course'. The nurse was like, 'no, have a look around, where are you?'
"I remember sitting there looking at the monitors, the wires and my bed and I said, 'yeah, the golf course'. I was convinced I was at the golf course."
Mackay-Steven, who admitted he thought the incident was a bit of a laugh at the time but had since recognised the seriousness, added: "My girlfriend was there and she had obviously had a hell of a night but she couldn't tell me where I was, I had to work it out myself or they couldn't release me.
"The nurse came back half an hour later, and I said I was on Union Street in Aberdeen. She said, 'No, you're not on Union Street' and I said, 'I know, I'm at the f*****g golf course'!"
The twice-cappped Scotland international said he had asked a doctor what had caused his confusion but didn't get a satisfactory answer.
"The doctor I asked didn't have a clue, and to this day I don't know. I'm not even a golfer, it was bizarre."
Mackay-Steven revealed he had been at a party on the Saturday night, but hadn't played in a match during the day. He believes his omission from the playing squad contributed to his survival.
"Maybe [not playing] was a good thing because I had the energy to keep afloat. I was swept down the river for a good bit, I remember being underwater and going pretty fast so it was mental. Being able to swim helped greatly," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scottish war artist Peter Howson unveils new work to commemorate massacre in Bosnia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Scottish artist Peter Howson, who is best known for his haunting images of the war in Bosnia, has created a new work depicting a mass genocide which claimed the lives of more than 8000 men and boys.
The Massacre of Srebrenica will be on display at the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art in Glasgow for the next three years after being created by the painter to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Europe’s biggest mass murder after the Second World War.
Howson, who was Britain’s official war artist during the civil war in Bosnia, said today he was still haunted by scenes he could only describe as “hell on earth.”
The Glasgow School of Art graduate was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum to produce work in the former Yugoslavia. Much of his work then has addressed themes of conflict, destruction, human suffering and redemption.
The 61-year-old, who has spoken previously about the impact his experiences had on his mental health and the eventual break-up of his marriage, said his new painting was intended to capture “a moment in Europe’s history.”Glasgow Museums chiefs hope that the public display of the painting will help younger generations “recognise the signs of intolerance and the violence it generates.
Howson said: “It is difficult to put into words the horror of the massacre of over 8,000 men and boys in the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian civil war. I was there as a war artist during this time and witnessed what I can only describe as hell on earth.
"The experience caused me many years of illness and the breakup of my family. I still have memories too painful to talk about, but painting these terrible events helps me to try and understand why we do such evil things to each other.
"This painting records a moment in European history; a memory in my mind’s eye of what happened that day. It portrays people who are dead and people, many of whom are young boys, ready to die.
"I tried to capture the fear on their faces and the twisting contortions of bodies awaiting execution with a bullet. Very little film of the prelude to death is recorded. It would have been different if it happened today in the age of the smartphone.
"The perpetrators show no emotion, just a will to get the job done. The beauty of the countryside is a chilling juxtaposition to the horror of the scene.
"The whole thing is witnessed by a little girl who has climbed a tree. There is not much more you can say. Did the soldiers really believe they were pleasing their God by doing this?"
Howson unveiled his new painting alongside his depiction of Jesus as a homeless man, which he created in 2018 in response to a sculpture by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz for St George’s Tron Parish Church in Glasgow.
Howson, from Prestwick, in Ayrshire, said his portrayal of Jesus was intended to show the isolation and loneliness of a “champion to the outcast and friend of the homeless.”
Harry Dunlop, learning and access curator with Glasgow Museums, said: "War and persecution motivated by religious and ethnic hatred continues to force hundreds of thousands of people from their homelands.
‘St Mungo Museum’s founding principle is to further understanding and respect between people of different faiths and those of none.
"We are hugely indebted to Peter Howson for loaning this extremely powerful and challenging painting to Glasgow Museums.
"It hangs in the museum's most prominent space because we hope it, together with other works on show, will raise awareness of the need to recognise prejudice, extremism and exclusion and the hatred it creates, and ultimately take action to end it.
"Peter’s work is difficult to look at, but that is the point of having it at St Mungos. We must continue to learn from past atrocities and ensure younger generations know how to recognise the signs of intolerance and the violence it generates wherever in the world it occurs and take action to stop it."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Graeme Souness believes more must be done to stamp out homophobia in football before any active gay players feel comfortable about coming out.
The 66-year-old former Liverpool and Rangers midfielder said he was from a generation which had been "extremely homophobic" but added that he had found a visit to the Pride Festival in Brighton last year enlightening.
But, speaking during a week in which the Premier League has supported Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport, Souness said there was still much work to be done.
"I think the PFA and Premier League have to look at themselves," Souness said on Sky Sports.
"You ask the question "why has no one ever come out?" I don't think football has created an environment where anyone would feel comfortable and confident about saying 'I am gay'.
"There must be gay and bisexual players playing in the Premier League, there has to be, but no one has felt comfortable enough to come out and say 'this is me'."
Souness, who began his career in 1970 with Tottenham and played on until 1991, when he was player-manager of Rangers, added: "I came from a generation, a time in our football, where it was extremely homophobic, the banter in the dressing room.
"But nine months ago I came and took part in a parade here, and it was enlightening and I learned so much and it changed my attitude.
"It was a fabulous day out, it was sunny, it was mobbed, there were tens of thousands of people there and I found it extremely educational and it was a thoroughly great day out.
"I would tell anyone if you want to learn more to come down here to that parade and you'll come away with a completely different opinion."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celtic transfer news: Neil Lennon to urge board to sign £90k-a-week Forster from Southampton permanently</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEIL LENNON will urge the Celtic board to splash the cash to sign Fraser Forster from Southampton.
The England keeper is on loan at Parkhead until the end of the season.
But after Forster’s heroics against Rangers in Sunday’s Betfred Cup final, Lennon wants to sign him for keeps.
The 31-year-old is paid £90,000 a week with the Premier League strugglers with two and a half years still to run on his contract.
Celts pay a significant percentage of his current salary as things stand — but Lennon is hopeful a deal can be thrashed out to bring the keeper back to the club next season.
He said: “It’s about affordability but that’s something we can talk about.
“I’ll talk to the player but first we have to make the call to Southampton and I’ll need to speak to Peter Lawwell about that.
“Is it beyond us? I don’t know. Would I love to do it? Of course, but we have to be realistic at times and we can’t go overboard either.
“We have to be prudent but we have him right now and it’s fantastic because he’s definitely made us better.”
Lennon signed Forster on a loan deal and there’s NOT a clause in the agreement which would allow Saints to recall the keeper next month.
He added: “If we only have him for a year, we’ll try to enjoy him while he’s here.
“He’s really happy - you can see that in his body language. He had a really difficult 18 months but for him to be back, he is so happy.”
Lennon insists Forster should be back in contention for the England squad and urged Gareth Southgate to give him a recall.
He added: “I think he’s better now than he was before and I certainly think Gareth should have a look at him. He’s been unbelievable. He’s more mature.
“He just wasn’t getting beat on Sunday, just not getting beat.
“He was absolutely remarkable and to do that in the context of a final, speaks volumes for his talent.
“He’s done it in Europe as well against a class side like Lazio, who beat Juventus the other night. It speaks volumes for the performance we put in when we were away and also at home.
“He is definitely in brilliant form and better than first time round.
“So, yes, I think he should be looked at regarding England and yes, we have to see on the other question.”
Lennon will now REST Forster for Thursday’s meaningless game against Cluj in Romania with Craig Gordon set to play.
He added: “What I’ve got now are three top-class goalkeepers.
“It’s difficult for Craig because he’s not done a lot wrong and, to be fair, Scotty Bain hasn’t, either.
“The opportunity to sign Fraser came around and I just thought ‘I can’t miss out on this one’ and, thankfully, it’s turned out to be the right call.
“I’m going to start Craig in Thursday to give him a game and keep him motivated and ticking over.
“It’s very difficult with goalkeepers but it was my call and sometimes you have to make these decisions for what you think is best for the team and the club.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five Nights at Freddy's really falls into that "single developer" category that's been so prevalent in the 2010s.
Scott Cawthon is responsible for a multi-million-dollar empire, alongside of recent solo studio names like Matt Thorson, Toby Fox and Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. It really is amazing when you think about it, but a recent string of Switch eShop releases got me thinking: how much of the general public plays Five Nights?
Me? I like to dabble in a bit of everything. Some of it's for research, and the rest I just have no excuse: I love games of all shapes and sizes. Also, I have young cousins and neighbors who constantly ask me if I play it (and Minecraft/Fortnite/Roblox) so I like to have an answer ready.
You've probably seen the merch at some point (or the above Fazbear/friends face), but let us know if you've ever played a Five Nights game before.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hamilton Zoo hosted a training event of a unique kind from 27-29 November, led by internationally renowned animal trainer, Peter Giljam from Zoospensefull, currently based in Sweden.
This was Peter’s second visit to Hamilton Zoo – in 2018, he held a series of workshops which were so well received, staff were determined to find a way for him to return.
They did so by inviting zookeepers and animal trainers from across the country, sharing the cost around. 30 individuals took up the offer, with representatives from Auckland, Wellington, Orana and Brooklands zoos, as well as staff from Kelly Tarlton’s Aquarium. A further 40 staff from Hamilton Zoo participated.
The three-day event focused on animal training with a blend of theory-based presentations and workshops along with practical sessions within various enclosures at Hamilton Zoo.
The sessions were geared at improving the animal/trainer connection, understanding animal queues (like widened eyes and quickened breath) and gradually shaping behaviour to establish routines and keep animals and staff safe.
Team Leader of birds and ectotherms at Hamilton Zoo, Grant Kother says: “It was a real privilege to have Peter with us for the second year in a row, albeit with a much larger group this time.
“Training animals is complex work – there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach and sometimes the most effective techniques run counter to what feels instinctive for us as humans.
“Peter has a reputation as one of the best in his field for good reason – a charismatic teacher, he has a hands-on approach which means staff get to put skills into practice in the moment, building confidence.
“We covered a lot of ground over the three days, starting with the basics like teaching animals to stay still for an extended period to help with vet checks and reinforcing certain behaviours using positive reinforcement, timing and setting up the environment to help the animal succeed.
“One of my personal highlights was learning about systems that will help us work more effectively as a team.
“The learning never ends for an animal trainer and I’m proud to be part of a team that embraces a growth mindset and inspires others to do the same.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Successful water action flotilla at Lyttelton Port</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fifteen kayaks, a yacht, and a ferry filled with over a hundred local school children joined the peace flotilla this morning at Lyttelton Port, Christchurch. They were encouraged from the land by approximately 80 human rights activists, who sang Saharawi songs of freedom. The action was to "unwelcome" the bulk carrying cargo ship the "Federal Crimson", as it arrived in Lyttelton carrying 50,000 tonnes of 'blood phosphate' from the occupied territory of Western Sahara. Christchurch group, ‘Ravensdown- Take ‘Em Down’ organised the water flotilla, inspired by the Peace Squadrons - which were instrumental in the NZ Nuclear Free campaign. Christchurch resident Catherline Low stated "I'm horrified that New Zealand companies are supporting human rights abuses by buying this phosphate. It has got to stop". Local organiser Josie Butler reports "Ravensdown are funding war crimes. We are here today to demand Ravensdown's CEO Greg Campbell to cease this internationally illegal import immediately".
The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union boarded the ship on arrival, issuing a letter of protest to the Captain of the ship. This comes following the Council of Trade Unions' resolution which was passed last month, condemning Morocco's illegal occupation of Western Sahara and calling upon the New Zealand government to halt importation of phosphate from the area. Dunedin based ‘Environmental Justice Ōtepoti’ are planning a barbecue to celebrate how far the campaign has come this year.
Morocco invaded Western Sahara in 1975 and have been exploiting the countries natural resources ever since. 173,000 Saharawi live in a refugee camp in Tindouf, Algeria. The government of Western Sahara, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, is recognised by 80 states, but not by New Zealand.
MINURSO; The United Nations mission for a peaceful resolution for the people of Western Sahara has so far failed to achieve the referendum that the Saharawi people are waiting for. New Zealand fertilizer companies Ravensdown and Ballance are being criticized for purchasing from Moroccan controlled phosphate exporter, OCP. “Every shipment purchased gives more reason for the occupying power to remain and delays a peaceful outcome for the Saharawi people.” said Rose Murphy of Environmental Justice Ōtepoti.
Mahmoud Lemadel is a journalist and activist living in El Aiuin within the occupied area. Mahmoud has thrown his support behind the planned protests. “ My dream of living in peace as a young man living in occupied territory is being stolen by the international companies who are funding the illegal plunder of my country. Among these dreams thieves are companies from New Zealand - Ravensdown and Ballance. These companies are supporting the presence of occupation in my country" said Lemadel.
“Ravensdown are ignoring the requests of the Saharawi people and their government to stop purchasing from OCP. Ravensdown justify their ongoing involvement by claiming the purchasing of blood phosphate benefits local people. This ignores the reality in the refugee camps and the violence and oppression experienced by Saharawi’s living in the occupied area,” said Rose Murphy. “Our groups have been in close contact with and are working alongside the Saharawi people to ensure their voices are heard.”
Earlier this year, 24 year old English teacher Sabah Osman was killed by Moroccan police while she celebrated Algeria’s victory in the football tournament, Africa Cup of Nations.“We intend to remember Sabah Osman at our event this week,” said Rose Murphy.
“It is shameful that Ravensdown continues to silence and erase the suffering of the people of Western Sahara. They (Ravensdown) are aware that this operation is a violation of human rights. The people of Western Sahara have a right to sovereignty. Ravensdown are complicit in allowing the military occupation to continue,” Murphy said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Packaging Forum urges Gov support to advance war on plastic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The country’s leading packaging member-based organisation is eager to work with Government to bring an end to plastic waste in New Zealand.
The Packaging Forum, which represents the depth and breadth of the country’s packaging industry, supports the creation of a National Plastics Action Plan including focusing on three priority areas; standardised nationwide kerbside recycling which will enable the roll out of nationally recognised “how and where” to recycle labelling on packaging, which in turn will support investment in onshore processing facilities.
This follows the release yesterday (8 December) of the Rethinking Plastics in Aotearoa New Zealand report by the Office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Professor Juliet Gerrard.
The Forum’s Independent Chair Rob Langford says the report contains a number of important areas of focus. “We absolutely agree we need a National Plastics Action Plan – one which is led by industry and supported by Government,” he says. “Industry needs to lead this as they are the experts on the vital role packaging has to play in containing and protecting food and other products as they move through the supply chain to the consumer.”
The Forum already delivers a number of voluntary product stewardship solutions and projects including those for plastic packaging. In July 2018, The Forum’s members pledged to make all their packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable (in NZ) by 2025.
“The pledge shows industry is already taking steps to lead the way to a plastics waste-free future through their commitment to product stewardship.”
For there to be significant action on reducing plastic waste in particular it is important that not only industry take action, but consumers and recyclers are part of the solution, facilitated by Government action, Rob says.
The Forum supports a consistent on-pack recycling labelling system which clearly indicates to consumers how and where to recycle the packaging, and that it has integrity and compliance enforced by an independent government agency.
However, one significant obstacle in launching a national recycling label is that what can be recycled at kerbside varies from council to council around the country, he says.
“The effectiveness of a recycling label will only be as good as the consistency of recycling services nationwide for the packaging material. Until we have consistency of what can be recycled at kerbside across New Zealand to at least 60% coverage, then all labels would need to refer back to the manufacturer or the Council and that defeats the purpose of the label.
“Therefore, we strongly recommend that any announcement about a labelling system goes hand in hand with an announcement to standardise recycling services.”
Investment in onshore processing facilities for the collected material is also vitally important, Rob says. “To move to a circular economy, we have to develop onshore recycling capacity and add value to our collected materials rather than relying on other countries to recycle our waste.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Road crews have worked long hours overnight to make progress on reopening a road link between Timaru and Ashburton.
Timaru District, which manages Route 72, the Upper Rangitata River at the Arundel bridge, is reopening that road at midday today.
• Speed restrictions will be in place and, due to the backlog of traffic in both directions, we expect travel times between Timaru and Christchurch to be significantly longer than normal. Travellers should add at least an extra hour to their travel times, and expect delays. • There are very limited services on this route via the Arundel bridge so people are asked to carry water and food.• There will be localised detours in place from Orari where there is a single lane bridge. Police will be present along the route.State Highway 1 over the Rangitata River bridge will stay closed today.
“State Highway 1 will not open today at the Rangitata bridge given the amount of water which has broken through stopbanks and needs to be redirected,” says Pete Connors, System Manager for Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency.

South Westland, SH6 – top and bottom access essential services, progress this week at each end
In South Westland, crews are beginning to tackle multiple slips on the Fox Hills, between the two glacier townships. It is hoped this area of highway will be open by the end of this week, says Mr Connors.
“The area around Whataroa at Mt Hercules is where we have the most slips, and we are aiming to have services reconnected for Christmas if not shortly after Christmas.”
• SH6 through South Westland is closed north of Haast and south of Harihari.• Residents and essential services can go south of Hokitika to Harihari. • Harihari to Whataroa will take longer to clear.• The road between the two glacier towns, Fox and Franz Josef, through the Fox Hills is being targeted to open by the end of this week. There are four or five slips along this section of road.• People can get between Haast and Makarora in Otago daytime hours 10 am to 4 pm, essential services and residents. Work on a slip at Clarke Bluff is continuing outside these hours this week.• Apart from South Westland, the West Coast’s other highways through the Otira Gorge, north to Punakaiki and Buller District and south to Hokitika are open for business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Safety first following Nelson road safety operation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Please attribute to Tasman Road Policing Manager Senior Sergeant Grant Andrews:
Nelson Police are urging people to put safety first following a weekend road safety operation.
Police set up a number of checkpoints across the district on Friday and Saturday focusing on impaired drivers.
Nelson City Council also joined the checkpoints and handed out chocolate Santas to sober drivers and passengers.
Over 2200 drivers were breath tested over the two nights.
Five drivers are facing prosecution for driving with excess breath alcohol, a further six drivers have had infringement notices issued and are forbidden to drive.
“The number of people driving impaired is disappointing and indicates people are not planning ahead to get themselves and other road users home safely,” Tasman Road Policing Manager Senior Sergeant Grant Andrews says.
“One of the drivers facing prosecution had been at a work function and the employer had arranged for prepaid taxis and a courtesy coach.
However, the person still chose to drive," sSenior Sergeant Andrews says.
“It’s clear that the message is not getting through to some drivers and they are choosing to place themselves and other road users at significant risk.
There simply isn’t any excuse for this behaviour.”
People need to make a plan when socialising and that should include for the following morning when they still may have alcohol in their system placing them over the limit.
Passengers also have a role to play – if your driver is impaired, take their keys and don’t get in the car.
If you are in any doubt at all about being safe or legal to drive after drinking, don’t drive.
Police will continue to carry out operations such as this leading into Christmas and throughout summer.
“Drivers can expect to see a greater presence on the roads and expect to be breath tested.
We want people to be able to have a safe and enjoyable Christmas.
That means all road users being responsible and looking out for each other.
"Always wear your seatbelt, put your phone away before you start driving and focus on what you’re doing, always drive to the conditions and within the speed limit, and never ever drive impaired by drugs, alcohol or fatigue.
It’s not worth your life or anyone else’s.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Discovery may open door to new medicines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bio-Protection Research Centre scientists and collaborators have made a discovery that potentially opens the door to new medicines and biological pesticides.
In work that began with a PhD thesis, and continued through postdoctoral work, they have shown that scientists have been missing potential new drugs and biopesticides, dismissing the genes that make them as non-functional variants.
“This is a fundamental discovery,” says Prof Barry Scott, who is based at Massey University. Prof Scott mentored Daniel Berry, the scientist who started investigating the “junk genes” as part of his PhD research in 2012.
Now Dr Berry is the lead author on the paper outlining the discovery, which has just been published in the highly prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr Berry’s discovery involves a group of “modular enzymes”, which naturally occur in fungi. Modular enzymes are molecular assembly lines that make bioactive substances, which scientists have harnessed to work as medicines, or as natural pesticides or growth enhancers in agriculture and horticulture.
The antibiotic penicillin is perhaps the best-known product of a modular enzyme.
In 2012, while researching for his PhD thesis, Dr Berry was investigating synthesis of peramine, a natural pasture pest-repellent made by a modular enzyme of the fungus Epichloë.
“A lot of the genes had been mucked up and didn’t make peramine,” says Prof Scott. “But one of those gene variants kept occurring, so although it looked like it wasn’t functioning, Daniel realised it had to serve some purpose, and decided to investigate.”
Prof Scott said for some time their investigations led nowhere. “That’s often the nature of science – it can take a long time.”
The breakthrough came when Daniel went to Germany to work with Dr Helge Bode, an expert in modular enzymes. With Dr Bode’s help, he discovered the modular enzyme from the variant gene produced a product they named cycloProArg, which is likely to be bioactive.
“It was an exciting day when we were finally able to identify what this gene was making,” says Dr Berry. “This discovery really opened the door for us, as it enabled identification of an additional three products that are made by other variants of this gene.”
“We don’t yet know precisely what cycloProArg does – that will be the subject of further research,” says Prof Scott. “But we know that as well as providing protection from pests, Epichloë promotes pasture growth and has lots of other beneficial effects. CycloProArg is probably responsible for one of those benefits.”
The real breakthrough, he says, is the discovery that modular enzymes make more than one bioactive product.
“Previously we thought one enzyme, one product,” says Prof Scott. “But we now know this is wrong.
“This fundamentally changes what we know, and what we should be looking for.
“Scientists in many fields – including medicine – should go back and take a look at previously discarded ‘junk genes’, because some of these may actually produce useful bioactive products.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BySean- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
Redmi will be holding the launch event for the Redmi K30 series tomorrow, 10th December 2019. It is not strictly a smartphone conference and will also feature the new products from the company like its new notebook computer, RedmiBook. However, prior to the official announcement, the live images of the RedmiBook have already surfaced online.
According to the images, we can observe the design of the RedmiBook. The yet to be announced notebook features minimal bezels on surrounding the screen with a high screen to body ratio. Furthermore, RedmiBook is a relatively small laptop with a screen size closer to 13-inches. It is no surprise considering it was labeled as a “lightweight player” by the Xiaomi subsidiary, although larger variants might also be announced.
Under the hood, the RedmiBook is confirmed to arrive with top notch specifications. This includes the Intel Core i7 processor of the latest 10th Generation which features a maximum core frequency of 4.9GHz. For graphics, it will feature NVIDIA‘s MX250 graphics card with 2GB of VRAM that is great for gaming and productivity purposes. In other words, the specs show that it is a capable ultrabook.
Previously, we had reported on a new RedmiBook 13 laptop being launched on 12th December 2019, and these might be the same notebook in question. Notably, the company has already launched the 15.6 inch and 14 inch models which also featured similar specs with 10th Gen Intel processors. Lastly, the 14 inch Enhanced Edition carried a price tag of 3,299 Yuan, so the 13 inch model is could be priced similarly or lower than its larger variant.

Oppo’s sub-brand – Realme recently unveiled Realme X2 Pro featuring Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset and a high-end Super AMOLED display. Realme made an entry into an affordable premium smartphone market with the Realme X2 Pro. It is set to compete against the OnePlus 7T Pro and Redmi K20 Pro. Apart from the hardware specs, the third-party development has also become a reason before buying a smartphone. In today’s article, we will guide users to unlock the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro easily (RMX1931).
Unlocking the bootloader of any Android smartphone is like a window to unlimited customizations. It opens doors to rooting the device and installing third-party recovery like TWRP. However, bootloader unlocking will void the warranty of your device. It is always recommended to follow the instructions carefully. Otherwise, you will end up with a bricked device. The Bootloader can also be relocked if it is not needed anymore.
The Realme X2 Pro is the company’s maiden premium flagship smartphone featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset coupled with Adreno 640 GPU. It is available in different storage variants including a 6GB + 64GB, 8GB + 128GB and 12GB + 256GB UFS 3.0 internal storage.
The smartphones feature a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED 90Hz refresh rate display having the resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. Moreover, its display supports 1000 nits maximum brightness level and supports HDR 10+. The device is encased in an aluminium frame and comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect against the frequent falls.
In optics, the Realme X2 Pro comes with a quad-camera module featuring a 64-MP primary camera, an 8-MP ultra-wide lens, a 13-MP telephoto lens, and a 2-MP depth sensor. There’s a 16-MP selfie camera on the front having an f/2.0 aperture for video calling.
The smartphone is backed by a 4000 mAh battery with 65W Super VOOC Flash Charge fast charging technology. There’s an in-display fingerprint sensor along with an accelerometer, proximity, gyroscope, and compass sensor.
You can follow our simple guide below to unlock the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro.
Note: GizmoChina.com is not responsible for any damage to smartphone and data while unlocking the bootloader. The process will void your warranty.
Note: Widevine L3 will replace Widevine L1, and the fingerprint sensor will stop working until the bootloader is locked again.
We hope you have successfully unlocked the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro. If you have any glitch while performing the above tasks, then make sure to comment below.

Xiaomi had an event today in Japan to mark its official entry into the island nation. The Chinese tech giant was supposed to launch in the country next year but decided to make it early. At the event today, Xiaomi announced five products including the Mi Note 10 series, the Mi Smart Band 4, Mi Power Bank 3
The Mi Note 10 series are the only smartphones Xiaomi announced at the event today. The Mi Note 10 (6GB + 128GB) has a price tag of JPY 52,800 (~$489) excluding tax while the Mi Note 10 Pro (8GB + 256GB) will sell for JPY 64,800 (~$597) excluding tax. Both phones will be sold by Amazon Japan. Pre-order starts today for the two devices but the Mi Note 10 will go on sale on December 16 while the Mi Note 10 Pro will go on sale on December 23.
The Mi Note 10 has a 6.47-inch AMOLED FHD+ display with a waterdrop notch and Gorilla Glass 5. It is powered by the Snapdragon 730G processor and packs a 5260mAh battery with support for 30W fast charging that allows you to charge the device from empty to full in just 65 minutes.
The phone has a 32MP selfie camera and a 108MP penta-camera setup on the back. The primary sensor is paired with a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, another 5MP 5x optical zoom camera, a 20MP ultrawide angle camera, and a 2MP macro camera. There is NFC, Bluetooth 5.0, dual SIM support, an audio jack, a USB Type-C port, and an in-display fingerprint scanner.
The Mi Note 10 Pro has nearly the same specs but its 108MP camera has an 8P lens and not a 7P lens like the standard version. It also has more RAM and storage.
The Mi Smart Band 4 is Xiaomi’s latest fitness tracker and it has made its way to Japan. The Mi Smart Band 4 will be sold for JPY 3490 (~$32) excluding tax by Amazon Japan. Pre-orders begin today while sale begins on December 23.
The Mi Power Bank 3 10000mah version brings 18W fast charging support for JPY 1899 (~$18) excluding tax. The power bank will be available in blue and silver and sold by Amazon but there is no mention of when it will be available for purchase.
Mi Power Bank 3 10000mAh Japanese version
The Mi Power 3 10000mAh is different from the one that launched in China early this year. The one sold in Japan has two full-size USB output ports rather than one. Its USB Type-C port is also only an input port, not a 2-way port. The power button is also a circle and no pill-shaped. You still get a MicroUSB port.
Xiaomi says the power bank is also allowed on flights.
Rice is a pretty popular food in Japan, so it is a smart move for Xiaomi to launch its Mi IH Rice Cooker in the market. This is a smart home product, so it works with the Mi Home App.
The rice cooker will sell for JPY 9,999 (~$92) excluding tax. There is no info on availability.
If you are a frequent traveler, then Xiaomi’s Mi Luggage will surely interest you. It will be available in Japan in two versions: a metal version with an aviation-grade aluminum body and a JPY 17,990 price tag and a more affordable JPY 7990 (~$74) version made of Makrolon. These suitcases will also be sold by Amazon.
The metal version comes in silver while the Makrolon version is available in blue, gray, and black. Both are 20-inch suitcases with TSA approved locks and adjustable handles.
Xiaomi also had the Mi MIX Alpha on display at the event but it was in a sealed box and could not be touched. Surprisingly, no Redmi products were announced at the event.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SC Issues Notice On TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Plea To Direct ECI To Publish Final Vote Counts Of General Elections</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Supreme Court today issued notice to the Election Commission of India on a plea by TMC MP Mahua Moitra seeking directions to the poll body to publish details of voter turnout and final vote counts on their website.
Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayan appearing for Moitra informed the court that Form 17C part I, 17C part II and Form 20 are prepared under the Conduct of Election Rules 1961 to record information regarding total votes recorded, result of counting and final result sheet respectively. It was also submitted that the practice of publishing Form 20 has been around since 2004, but was discontinued during the 2019 general elections. The allegation levied is that Form 20 was being published till the first four phases, but the poll body stopped doing so for the fifth, sixth and seventh phases in the wake of discrepancies emerging between the total votes polled and total votes counted on EVMs. Upon being questioned by the bench, comprising of CJI SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, whether this was only the case only in Bengal, Sankaranarayanan informed that the petitioner was an MP from West Bengal, but that should not be confused with the plea which is regarding all of India.
CJI Bobde also asked if the publishing of the Forms was mandated by the Election Manual.
With regard to this aspect, the petition invokes Article 19(1)(a) to state that the right to know and receive information about the integrity of the electoral process mandates a direction from court to the poll body to formulate a protocol for publishing this information. It has further been submitted that these are statutory forms which the poll body is under no legal obligation to publish, however it does have a Constitutional duty under Article 324 to ensure the credibility of the election process is upheld and democracy is allowed to thrive. Accountability and transparency of the election process has been cited to urge the court to direct the ECI to come up with a protocol for publishing these forms, which in turn are used to tally information during elections. It has further been prayed that information regarding Form 17C part I and 17C part II (total voter turnout and total votes cast) in every subsequent parliamentary and assembly election must be published on the ECI website within 48 hours of them being created, and Form 20 (the final result sheet) must be published in 7 days after it's readied.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Magnum Reloaded: ‘Blood brothers’ reunite to help a buddy on ‘Magnum P.I.’ | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most people know that when a Hawaiian says you are part of their ʻohana, they do not say this lightly. ʻOhana means family, but sometimes “family” can simply be friends who have been with you through the best and worst of times. In this week’s “Magnum P.I.”, Magnum (Jay Hernandez), Rick (Zachary Knighton), and TC (Stephen Hill) risk everything to help Nuzo’s (Domenick Lombardozzi) brother Paulie (Louis Lombardi) rescue Ahmed (Mohit Gautam) an Afghan boy Paulie grew close to when they were all stationed in Afghanistan seven years before.
The title of the episode, “Blood Brothers,” definitely encapsulates the overall theme threaded throughout the storyline. When Paulie arrives at Rick’s La Mariana, he asks the guys to help him get Ahmed off a container ship heading toward Oahu. Paulie is trying to sneak the teenager into America and away from the Taliban who killed his mother and his adopted family. While they all work to find him, with a bit of help from Higgins (Perdita Weeks) and Katsumoto (Tim Kang), Magnum recalls the team’s tour in Afghanistan when they met Ahmed and his mother.
Written by Peter Lenkov and Eric Guggenheim and directed Peter Weller, the episode delivers strong performances from the main cast as well as special guest star Lombardi. And Lombardozzi’s return as Nuzo in well-placed flashbacks is always welcome. Lombardozzi, whose character, unfortunately, was murdered in the pilot “I Saw the Sun Rise,” consistently delivers a solid performance and he helps add Magnum’s backstory.
The entire episode was expertly paced as the tension and need to find Ahmed after he is forced to leave the container ship, and then kidnapped by human traffickers, added to the intensity of the episode. And when the team finally finds the boy, the true emotion expressed by all of the actors was natural and believable. Overall, this episode was one of the strongest of the season thus far.
YOU BLEED, I BLEED
The idea that Magnum, Rick, TC, and Nuzo are truly blood brothers after surviving war and 18 months and 11 days in a POW camp, is definitely brought to the forefront in this episode. As Magnum reminds Nuzo in the flashbacks “You bleed, I bleed,” he says. It means more than just literal bleeding for each other — it’s about having each other’s backs, and supporting them no matter where the mission takes them.
The episode flips back and forth between Thomas and the team looking for Ahmed in the present time, after he is forced off of the container ship when ICE arrives to search it, and flashbacks to the team’s time in Afghanistan when Ahmed was nine-years-old. Magnum is teaching him English, while Rick and TC show him their mean tetherball moves, and they all rally around him as Paulie loans him his Yankees cap and shows him how to throw some heat and strike Magnum out. They are sweet and funny scenes that help alleviate all the palpable sadness when Ahmed’s mother is killed and when they cannot find him once he makes it to Oahu.
Paulie is Nuzo’s older brother who works for a contracting company in the motor pool at their base. He specifically took the job to be closer to Nuzo as he served overseas. When Paulie doesn’t return to the base after going to visit Ahmed and his mother, Nuzo asks Magnum, Rick, and TC to help him. When they find Ahmed’s town deserted, they search the mountains and find his mother among all the dead. They barely make it back, and when they do, Paulie’s been shot in the leg, and all four are in front of Capt. Greene (James Remar) to be disciplined.
TAKING A HELPING HAND
Of course, they survive to fight another day, and that day comes when Paulie arrives to ask them to help find Ahmed. And when Ahmed is tricked into leaving a homeless camp by a group of human traffickers, it takes reaching out to Paulie’s contact who got Ahmed on the container ship — Gerard Hirsch (Willie Garson). Many fans know Garson’s character from “Hawaii Five-0.” Hirsch is a former art dealer and smuggler who knows how to get “art, vehicles, even people on and off the island.” Hirsch who “hates to be the good guy” gives up the name of the human trafficker who he thinks most likely kidnapped Ahmed once he got off of the container ship and landed on a beach on Oahu.
Magnum also takes Higgins’ advice and reaches out to Katsumoto — who is willing to help if he can do it properly, as he is still under review with HPD. And he wants to help as his grandfather came to Hawaii illegally and he believes “in what that statue in New York says.”
BLOOD BROTHERS
The team, with the help of Katsumoto and HPD, rescues Ahmed. It is a bittersweet reunion, especially when Ahmed asks about Nuzo. As they all look away, Paulie tells him that “he would’ve been here if he could.” The pain of losing Nuzo is all over their faces but it passes as they are relieved to find Paulie’s boy.
The hardest moment had to be when Magnum talks to Nuzo in a picture of the team hanging in La Mariana, “I wish you could’ve been with us today. It was like like old times. You bleed, I bleed. And, listen, if, uh if Paulie ever needs us again, we got his back.” This is confirmed when Paulie tells them, “When my brother died, I thought I didn’t have a family anymore. But I was wrong. You guys are my brothers.” He says the truth about all of the characters — they are certainly brothers until the end.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oklahoma City nonprofit raises funds to serve human trafficking survivors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dragonfly Home, a metro-area nonprofit that helps human trafficking survivors, is holding its third annual “Drive for Dragonfly” fundraiser.
Dragonfly operates Oklahoma’s only state-certified human trafficking crisis center and is working to open a sex trafficking shelter in Oklahoma City.
Since receiving state certification from the Attorney General’s Office in November 2016, Dragonfly has served more than 300 victim-survivors of sex and labor trafficking, and fielded more than 3,000 calls to its 24-hour helpline.
The fundraising effort is led by Maddie McNeill, a recent University of Oklahoma graduate, and Rebecca Jakopin and Shary Bouvette, two current OU students.
McNeill said she was inspired to start Drive for Dragonfly while studying social work.
“I wanted to uncover human trafficking and raise awareness that people are trafficked every single day here in Oklahoma,” she said. “The human trafficking survivors getting help at The Dragonfly Home are real people who have gone through real trauma — awful, unspeakable things that people should never have to go through.”
In 2017, the fundraising campaign raised more than $7,500. In 2018, the campaign raised more than $17,000.
Through Dec. 31, Drive for Dragonfly participants create a personalized fundraising page through the nonprofit’s website and share the link on social media. Participants also wear a temporary tattoo every day in December as a symbol of Drive for Dragonfly.
“The Drive for Dragonfly leaders chose a temporary tattoo to represent the ‘branding’ that traffickers often use to demonstrate control over the person they are trafficking,” said Whitney Anderson, a co-founder and the executive director of Dragonfly. “At Dragonfly, we stand against the idea that human beings are for sale. Our temporary tattoos for Drive for Dragonfly declare that everyone deserves ‘A Future of Freedom.’”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to NASA’s Asteroid Fast Facts page, a lot of space material lands on Earth every year. From the NASA page:
“Every day, Earth is bombarded with more than 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles.
“About once a year, an automobile-sized asteroid hits Earth's atmosphere, creates an impressive fireball, and burns up before reaching the surface.
Every 2,000 years or so, a meteoroid the size of a football field hits Earth and causes significant damage to the area.”
When is the next one coming? No one knows. But NASA and other organizations worldwide constantly watch out for possible impactors from space. Even so, some escape discovery until they hit. In 2013, a small asteroid, about the size of a six-story building, entered our atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russian. It exploded with a blast more powerful than the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. The blast shattered glass in buildings all over the city and caused injuries to more than 1,200 people. It was so bright that scientists estimate it briefly outshone the sun. We had no warning of this event. No one saw it coming.
Many telescopes automatically search the night sky for incoming asteroids, for one with Earth in its sights. But scientists need your help finding them. You may be the one to spot the next one that threatens Earth.
An organization called Zooniverse currently has 108 projects where anyone, even you, can help scientists make new discoveries. I have written about Zooniverse before, but they have added quite a few new projects since then and more are added every year. You can find them at www.zooniverse.org.
The project to help find potentially dangerous asteroid is at www.zooniverse.org/projects/sandorkruk/hubble-asteroid-hunter. As with all the Zooniverse projects, you get a brief tutorial on what to look for and how to identify a target. Then you are presented with a series of photos. Using what you learned in the tutorial, you identify potential asteroid targets. Once identified, the project scientists analyze the photo to calculate the asteroid’s path to determine if Earth is in the way.
If saving the Earth from asteroid impacts isn’t your cup of tea, look through all of their projects. It’s likely one or several of the others will pique your interest.
Meteor Shower
The Geminid meteor shower peaks on the night of Friday and Saturday. While it can produce as many as 100 meteors per hour, a bright moon only three days past full will block out all but the brightest.
If you happen to be spending Christmas in Indonesia, Southeast Asia or Australia this year, step outside in the early afternoon. The moon passes between us and the sun, creating a solar eclipse. The moon is farther than average from us and won’t quite cover the entire disk of the sun. A ring, or annulus, of sunlight will encircle the dark moon, creating a relatively rare annular eclipse.
We won’t see any of this eclipse in Oklahoma. The next eclipse we see any part of in our state occurs on Oct. 14, 2023. But mark April 8, 2024, on your calendar. A total solar eclipse passes over southeast Oklahoma on that day, the best eclipse to hit our state in living memory.
Planet Visibility Report
December begins with Mars and Mercury in the pre-dawn sky. Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are grouped fairly close together low in the evening twilight. Over the course of the month, Venus gets higher, while the other two sink into invisibility on the twilight. Mercury also dives into the sun’s morning twilight glare, and by month’s end, only Venus in the evening sky and Mars in the morning sky remain visible. Full moon occurs on the 11th with new moon following on Christmas day.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Related coverage
U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe and U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn leveled harsh criticism last week at the contractor accused of negligence and fraudulent activity while operating private housing at Tinker Air Force Base and other military installations.
Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, referred to Balfour Beatty Communities as “notorious.” Horn, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told a company executive she was “incredibly disappointed you have failed to live up to your responsibility for taking care of the people that are living in these houses.”
At a hearing of his committee, Inhofe asked Air Force Secretary Barbara M. Barrett, “If you have a repeater like this and misconduct like this, why is it that they are still there?
“What do we have to do? How do you pull a plug? How do you get that done?”
Barrett said, “That company received a letter of concern from the Air Force expressing that the Air Force has lost confidence in their ability to perform under their contract. That letter was issued in September.
“Since that time, they have not been receiving performance incentive fees. Since that time, all of their contracts — they have the contract on many bases — all of their performance fees have been withheld.
“So they are under financial penalty right now. In addition to that, it has been requested that they submit an action plan for what they will be doing. That plan is due by the end of the year, and there will be metrics and accountability from that plan or the Air Force will be initiating the elements accessible to us under the dispute resolution procedures, which could lead to anything up to a default on their lease.”
Inhofe, R-Tulsa, has held several hearings and visited Tinker repeatedly since reports from Reuters and other news outlets documented severe problems, including mold and insect infestation, at military family housing.
Residents of the base, located in Oklahoma County, complained that company officials were dismissive and that problems were rarely fixed. Balfour Beatty Communities operates about 600 units on Tinker and 43,000 on bases nationally.
Regarding the problem nationally, lawmakers, base commanders and service officials have pleaded ignorance, saying oversight has been limited since housing contracts were given to private companies.
Inhofe and Horn backed provisions in the annual defense bill that would give residents more rights and impose standard measurements for private housing companies’ performance. The military also will be required to conduct more oversight of housing. The defense bill may come up for a final vote this week.
Horn, D-Oklahoma City, said she first heard of the conditions early this year from a military family member at Tinker.
“I was angry and frustrated and hoping it was a limited problem but, sadly, found out it was not,” Horn told Richard C. Taylor, a Balfour Beatty Communities executive, at a hearing of the Armed Services subcommittee on Readiness last week.
“Infestations are rampant across Tinker. And it’s one of those things that’s so outrageous to me that we’re not taking care of service members and their families.”
At the hearing, Horn showed an enlarged photo of extensive mold in a Tinker home managed by Balfour Beatty Communities.
“That picture is unacceptable,” Taylor said. “Absolutely unacceptable.”
Horn referenced reports by Reuters and CBS News that Balfour Beatty Communities had falsified maintenance logs at Tinker to make it appear requests were handled more quickly than they were. She asked Taylor if the company would apply corporate incentive payments received during that time to housing repairs.
Taylor said the company was working with the U.S. Department of Justice on its inquiry and had hired an outside company to investigate the allegations.
“In the event that we are found to have falsified records then we are absolutely committed to refunding any incentive fees received back to those projects,” Taylor told the subcommittee.
Taylor said he endorsed the national defense bill provisions, including the tenants’ bill of rights. Leaders from other private housing contractors testified at the subcommittee that they were also working on improvements.
U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., chairman of the Readiness subcommittee, visited Tinker earlier this year with Horn. He said last week the companies have had enough time to scrutinize their own conduct and must now act.
“We ask our service members and their families to sacrifice enough in service to their country, we will not ask them to accept sub-standard housing as well,” he said.
“They deserve better and this committee will demand that they get it.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 1,500 cubic yards of concrete slurry, delivered by 150 trucks, was poured overnight Friday for the foundation of a new entrance and exit ramp tower that will provide access to structured parking as part of the redevelopment of First National Center.
Demolition of the 1971 First National annex facing Broadway started in July 2018 and wrapped over the summer.
Developer Gary Brooks said the late-hour pour was scheduled to avoid traffic hassles and other inconveniences to downtown workers, visitors and residents as a result of the large line-up of trucks.
The new tower will connect to the 1957 annex facing Park Avenue that is being converted into parking. The first two floors will be rebuilt as a retail gallery.
All of this work is part of a $250 million redevelopment of the original Art Deco First National tower built in 1931 which is being converted into housing, retail and a hotel. Brooks said the garage will be the first part of the project to open with a date set for early 2021.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gov. Kevin Stitt on Friday appointed a new director to oversee the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, following the previous director's abrupt departure.
Scott Crow, who has been with the department for more than 20 years and served as interim director since June, will lead the state agency that oversees Oklahoma’s correctional facilities.
The department's previous director, Joe Allbaugh, abruptly resigned at a Board of Corrections meeting in June. At the time, Crow, who served as the department’s chief of operations, stepped into the interim director role.
In a news release, Stitt praised Crow for his strong leadership at the agency leading up to when Oklahoma released more than 450 low-level, nonviolent drug and property crime offenders last month.
“Crow successfully led the agency to accomplish major initiatives, such as the inaugural re-entry fairs ahead of the HB 1269 commutation release," Stitt said. "Crow is strengthening morale among employees and setting goals to modernize operations, and he is the right person to receive the appointment to be the next director of ODOC.”
Crow joined the department as a special investigator supervisor in 1996. Before that, he worked in local law enforcement in southwest Oklahoma. He was the assistant police chief in Cache and served as a captain in the Comanche County Sheriff's Department.
“This is a post I accept with humility, a sense of duty, no illusions of the work that lies ahead — and an eye toward what works in corrections," Crow said.
The Corrections Department has more than 4,300 employees at 24 facilities across the state. The corrections system is currently home to about 25,000 inmates with another 31,000 people under community supervision.
Crow's appointment is contingent on approval from the state Senate.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Related coverage
U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn faced frustrated constituents on Sunday at a town hall meeting, where people voiced anger over impeachment and the lack of accomplishments the divided government has produced this year.
“As an independent voter, I think you’re in a lot of trouble if you vote for this impeachment,” Susan Jaslow, of Edmond, told Horn.
Ronda Peterson, of Edmond, who identified herself as a conservative, said Congress had been consumed all year with impeaching President Donald Trump.
“We want Congress to get back to work for the American people, please,” Peterson said.
Horn, D-Oklahoma City, who had earlier reiterated her position that she hasn’t made up her mind on impeachment, told Peterson, “It’s frustrating for me. Because that’s not what I’m doing on a day-to-day basis. I didn’t run to impeach anybody. I ran to fight for Oklahoma, for education, for health care … and that’s where I’ve been spending my time.”
Horn's district includes most of Oklahoma County and Pottawatomie and Seminole counties. She held the town hall meeting on Sunday at Santa Fe South High School in south Oklahoma City.
Horn is one of about 30 Democrats who represent districts that favored Trump in 2016. A freshman who scored an upset victory last year, she is considered among the most vulnerable House Democrats going into 2020. Eight Republicans have already announced they would run for the seat.
Two Republican-aligned groups have financed recent ad campaigns attacking Horn's voting record and urging people to call her office to express opposition to impeachment.
Horn voted last month to extend the impeachment inquiry into a public phase. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment soon, and a full House vote may come before Christmas. If Trump is impeached, the Senate would hold a trial.
The House has been investigating whether Trump conditioned military aid to Ukraine on whether that country looked into potential corruption involving the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat who may be Trump’s rival for the presidency next year.
Horn has sponsored legislation on student loans, prescription drugs, mental health, defense and other topics but acknowledged Sunday that impeachment was taking up “most of the air in the room.”
She blamed the media in part, saying “it’s just easier to cover those things that fire people up and divide them.”
One audience member noted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, had refused to consider dozens of bills approved by the House, which is controlled by Democrats, and asked whether the rules could be changed.
Horn, referring to the fact that Trump opposed many of the Democratic bills, said work on legislation should be conducted whether the president opposes it or not.
“It’s not a vertical reporting structure,” she said. “We’re co-equal branches. … There’s not a lot we can do at this moment but continue to advocate for the Senate to take up some of the bills.”
The House this week is expected to vote on a bill aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Horn told reporters the bill was “a good start” and she expected to vote for it.
“It contains some provisions that will move us down the road to helping address the astronomical cost of prescription drugs, including the bill that I introduced to cap the out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare Part D at $2,000 per year, which would save them $3,100 per year,” she said.
Responding to a reporter’s question about the potential political cost of impeachment, Horn said, “When I am making any decision, the thing that is first and foremost is my oath to protect and defend the Constitution, to protect our systems … and to look at every issue that comes in front of me with scrutiny, not through the lens of a partisan issue, as a Democrat or a Republican, but: Is it the right thing to do?”
Jaslow said she was a part of a big group of independent voters in Edmond who were upset about impeachment. Jaslow said she voted for Horn last year.
“If she votes for impeachment, she’s screwed,” Jaslow said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hong Kong police say they have made 6,022 arrests and fired nearly 16,000 tear gas rounds during six months of anti-government protests that have shaken the city.
Police say the arrests included 11 people detained in raids over the weekend that netted a pistol and other weapons. Police suspect the weapons were intended for use during a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands of peaceful marchers on Sunday.
Police also arrested 12 people on Monday suspected of preparing gasoline bombs.
Police said they have also fired 10,000 rubber baton rounds during the six months of protests and that 493 officers have been injured.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday resigned as the Congress Legislature Party leader, taking moral responsibility for the party's poor show in the assembly bypolls.
The Congress, which held 12 of the 15 seats where byelections were held on December five, won only two, in a huge set-back to the opposition party.
In a letter to Interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Siddaramaiah expressed his sincere regrets for not being able to give "satisfactory results" in the byelections.
"I deem it necessary to step down as Leader of the CLP by taking moral responsibility", he wrote.
"As a CLP leader, there is a need to uphold the democratic principles. In the interest of the party, I have tendered my resignation as the CLP leader", Siddaramaiah told reporters.
The byelection was seen as much a litmus test for Siddaramaiah as it was for Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tata Motors plans to add 100 new passenger vehicle outlets by FY 20 end</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Auto major Tata Motors plans to add 100 sales outlets for passenger vehicles by the end of the current fiscal as it aims to enhance its reach in the country, a senior company official said.
The company, which has around 860 sales outlets spread across the country, has already added up around 100 outlets in the current financial year till now.
"We are expanding sales network. Basically, we are getting into new locations. Idea is that per dealer sales should go up. Dealers are excited with our product range and they are willing to expand their territories by opening new outlets," Tata Motors President (Passenger Vehicles Business Unit) Mayank Pareek told PTI.
There was a plan to add 200 new sales outlets this fiscal, he added.
"Of this 100 has already been added this fiscal, and in rest of the months we will add another 100 showrooms," Pareek said.
The company used to add just 100 showrooms per financial year, and this year has been an exception, he noted.
"With new outlets, the total count would go up to around 960 showrooms by the end of 2019-20," Pareek said.
He, however, added that the company is also in the process of closing various dealerships which have been under performing.
"These are people who are not interested in raising the bar and are unable to face the tough market situation situation right now," Pareek said.
When asked about the number of such dealerships facing closure, he declined to share details, terming it as a "continuous process".
Tata Motors is looking to increase its penetration in the domestic passenger vehicle segment with entry into the premium hatchback segment.
With its new model Altroz, the company aims to enhance its presence to around 60 per cent of the total passenger vehicle market.
"We now have two platforms -- Alfa and Omega. Our plan is that in each of these platforms we should have 6-7 top heads which could be small hatch, big hatch, mid hatch, mini van, MPV, small sedan, big sedan etc," Pareek said.
The company has also developed a lot of concepts, the idea being that in the next 4-5 years, it should be able to cover 90 per cent of the market, he added.
"Even with Altroz, the company would just be able to cover around 60 per cent of the market," Pareek said.
Altroz, which comes with BS-VI compliant petrol and diesel powertrains, is set for launch next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here's why Saudi Aramco's stock is unlikely to plunge on its debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When shares of Saudi Arabia’s national oil company begin trading Wednesday after the world’s largest initial public offering, the stars will be aligned to ensure that the stock price holds up.
Aramco sold $25.6 billion of shares at 32 riyals each, the top of the range at which they were marketed, and the company had orders for $119 billion of stock. About 4.9 million individual investors, almost 15% of the kingdom’s population, applied for the shares. Saudi Arabia sold only 1.5% of the company’s capital in the IPO.
That unsatisfied demand alone should ensure a strong first day of trading. But Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman isn’t leaving anything to chance. From bonus shares to a fat dividend, there’s a lot to underpin the price, at least initially. His half-brother, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, predicted Friday that Aramco’s value will soon surge, just after the kingdom announced production cuts that were taken as supportive for oil prices.
“I see further upside to the stock after listing due to the fact that investors will be chasing the stock to complete their exposure, since the deal was oversubscribed,” said Ali El Adou, head of asset management at Daman Investiments in Dubai. Aramco shares also will be supported by the company’s dividend plans and strong balance sheet, he said.
For now, at least, the IPO also has the benefit of an increase in the broader market. The main equity index in Riyadh was up 0.9% at 12:45 p.m. local time, extending gains this week to 3.4%.
Here’s a look at some of the other reasons why the stock is unlikely to plunge on its debut.
Keep Them Now, Get More Soon
Individual investors in Saudi Arabia were heavily targeted by a country-wide marketing campaign prior to the IPO. Retail investors who hold the shares for 180 days from the first day of trading will be eligible to receive one share for every 10 held. The maximum bonus shares will be 100 per investor.
To boost demand, authorities allowed lenders to provide credit for stock purchases at a proportion that was twice the usual for IPOs. That might have helped inflate demand for the offering. Of course, if the stock falls in the short term, that could result in mark-to-market losses on margin loans for the banks, said Edmond Christou, who follows banks for Bloomberg Intelligence in Dubai.
Guaranteed Dividends
Aramco’s board said the company will pay at least $75 billion of ordinary dividends in 2020, in addition to any potential special payouts. Investors were given the guarantee that the dividend won’t fall until after 2024, regardless of what happens to oil prices. Dividend sustainability is supported by stable cash flows and the company’s relatively small planned increase in capital spending, amid other factors, analysts at KAMCO Investment Co. wrote in a note on Dec. 4.
The Invisible Hand
Traders, investors and analysts in the past have speculated that funds tied to the Saudi government have stepped in to prop up the stock market, especially at moments of increased geopolitical volatility. In a poll of 24 money managers last month, 22 said they expect Aramco shares to be supported by government-related funds once they start trading.
The Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, didn’t respond to a request for comment on whether it will buy Aramco shares in the secondary market.
Fast Track to Indexes
Aramco is so big that index compilers will speed up its inclusion in global benchmarks. MSCI Inc., which provides the most popular emerging-markets equity index, said last month that Aramco will be added by the close of Dec. 17 if it starts trading on or before Dec. 12. The inclusion by MSCI should trigger about $2.4 billion in flows into the stock, according to estimates by Saudi Fransi Capital. FTSE Russell also has said it’s studying the potential fast-track inclusion of the stock in its benchmarks.
One of a Kind
The Gulf is a benchmark globally for oil exploration, with Saudi Arabia seen as the de facto leader of OPEC countries. But the Saudi company is actually the first major oil producer in the region to be publicly traded. It gives local investors a rare chance to directly tap the industry.
Markets being what they are, all of the above is no guarantee that the stock will surge, or how long it will stay up. Many international money managers spurned the offering, saying the valuation was too high, especially compared to other oil majors and their fat dividends.
“The over-subscription will insure there is elevated demand in the secondary market once it starts trading, but I am not sure how sustainable that demand will be if the share price moves higher than 32 riyals per share,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, the chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital Ltd. in Abu Dhabi. “One thing is for sure, there will be volatile sessions initially until the market arrives at equilibrium price.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adityanath govt clears Rs 1,600 cr Ballia Link Expressway project</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Uttar Pradesh cabinet today cleared the decks for the proposed Ballia Link Expressway project, which is estimated to cost Rs 1,600 crore.
The project would link Ballia district on the UP-Bihar border with the under-construction Purvanchal Expressway, which is aimed at connecting the backward eastern UP region with central UP at Lucknow, and via Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Greater Noida-Agra Expressway with the National Capital Region (NCR).
In the state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Adityanath this morning, the government gave its nod for preparing the detailed project report (DPR) for the project.
The four-lane expressway, expected to be 35-40 km long, is likely to cost almost Rs 40 crore per km, thus entailing maximum investment of Rs 1,600 crore.
According to UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) CEO, the Ballia Link Expressway would provide seamless road connectivity from the NCR to the UP-Bihar border areas and give impetus to trade and socio-economic development.
The 353 km Purvanchal Expressway, estimated to cost Rs 23,000 crore, would cut across Lucknow, Barabanki, Faizabad, Ambedkarnagar, Amethi, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur.
On November 11, the Adityanath government had cleared the decks for two other mega expressway projects totalling more than Rs 14,500 crore in Bundelkhand and Eastern UP regions.
These two projects include the 296-km Bundelkhand Expressway and the 91-km Gorakhpur Link Expressway, estimated to cost Rs 9,921 crore (including land cost of Rs 2,202 crore) and Rs 4,587 crore (including land cost of Rs 1,564 crore) respectively.
While these two projects are estimated to be completed in 36 months each, the concessionaries would be paid five per cent incentive of the contracted amount, if they complete the project in 30 months.
Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur Link expressways have been divided into 6 and 2 packages respectively for their speedier completion.
For Bundelkhand Expressway, the cabinet cleared the proposal to award different packages to selected bidder viz. Apco Infratech, Ashoka Buildcon, Gawar Construction and Dilip Buildcon.
Bundelkhand Expressway would span Jhansi, Banda, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah districts, and touch Agra-Lucknow Expressway at Etawah.
The government has already released Rs 2,157 crore towards land acquisition in the project, while Rs 7,000 crore in bank loan had been availed of.
For the Gorakhpur Link Expressway, the cabinet approved awarding of the contract to the lowest bidders Apco Infratech and Dilip Buildcon. The project spans Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar and Azamgarh districts. While, UP has already released Rs 940 crore towards land acquisition, Rs 2,275 crore had been taken from banks as loans to complete the ambitious project that relates to Adityanath’s pocket borough.
Currently, several projects are under various stages of development under UPEIDA, namely, Agra-Lucknow Expressway, Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway, Ganga Expressway, Ballia Link Expressway, Defence Manufacturing Corridor, and Semi High-speed Rail Corridor.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As many as 5.91 crore people have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and 15.47 crore people enlisted under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) since the launch of the two social security schemes in 2015, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The minister said that for creating a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor and the under-privileged, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the two schemes in the insurance sector on pan-India basis on May 9, 2015 in Kolkata.
"As per information furnished by banks, 5.91 crore people have been enrolled under PMJJBY and 15.47 crore people enrolled under the PMSBY as on March 31, 2019," she said during the Question Hour.
The PMJJBY offers life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh in case of death due to any reason to people in the age group of 18-50 years having a bank or post office account, who give their consent to join or enable auto-debit of premium of Rs 330 per annum.
The PMSBY offers insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh for accidental death or total permanent disability and Rs 1 lakh for partial permanent disability to people in the age group of 18-70 years with a bank or post office account, who give their consent to join or enable auto-debit of premium of Rs 12 per annum.

Yes Bank Ltd. hasn’t issued the so-called no objection certificate as it’s seeking assurances on repayments of other loans taken by Coffee Day, said the people, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. All other creditors have approved the transaction, the people said.
Shares of Coffee Day extended decline to as much as 14.5% in Mumbai, which is the biggest drop since July 31.
Coffee Day, which runs India’s largest coffee chain, has been trying to sell its assets to repay its debt after the unexpected death of its founder billionaire V.G. Siddhartha. On Aug. 14, the company announced that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell Global Village Tech Park to Blackstone in a deal valued at 26 billion rupees ($366 million) to 30 billion rupees.
Tanglin Developments Ltd., a unit of Coffee Day that controls Global Village Tech Park in Bangalore, owes Yes Bank about 1 billion rupees, according to the people. In addition, Coffee Day also owes the lender about 14 billion rupees, the people said.
Yes Bank could eventually approve the transaction, one of the people said. Representatives for Blackstone, Coffee Day and Yes Bank declined to comment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yes Bank Ltd. is likely to reject an offer that made up more than half of its planned $2 billion capital raising, and is talking to institutional investors about making up the shortfall, according to a person familiar with the matter.
At a meeting on Tuesday, the board is expected to reject an offer from Canada’s Erwin Singh Braich and Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings to contribute $1.2 billion toward the fund raising, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
After initially dropping on the news, Yes Bank shares reversed the losses to trade 1.9% higher. They are down 17% since it announced the names of the investors for its proposed preferential issue at the end of last month.
Doubts over key foreign bidders have triggered concerns that the Reserve Bank of India might not allow them to take ownership stakes in the lender. Braich has battled members of his family and creditors in numerous lawsuits, according to Canadian court records.
The bank would prefer to have institutions rather than individual investors involved in its fund raising, said the person, who declined to name the companies in discussions with the bank.
“This is purely speculative and Yes Bank does not, as a matter of policy, comment on market speculation,” Yes Bank said in an emailed response to a request for comment.
Yes Bank needs new investors in order to replenish its capital, which has fallen close to the regulatory minimum following hefty provisions against bad loans. Getting strong investors is important for the capital-starved lender, which has also been hurt by the country’s deepening shadow banking crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crisis: Watch Every DC Cameo from Part 1 of the Arrowverse Crossover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"Crisis on Infinite Earths" viewers anxious to see the various cameo appearances from DC characters didn't have to wait very long once the event began.
Part one of the Arrowverse crossover aired on Sunday's episode of Supergirl, and the introduction wasted little time delivering the promised appearances. After a short recap featuring the Arrowverse's known characters, the cameos began rolling. The first to appear is Robert Wuhl reprising his role as newspaper reporter Alexander Knox from the 1989 Batman film. The world is appropriately designated as Earth-89.
Next up is Curran Walters and Alan Ritchson as Jason Todd/Robin and Hank Hall/Hawk, respectively, from Earth-9 -- home of DC Universe's Titans streaming series. Russell Tovey, as The Ray from Earth-X, follows. The character appeared as a member of the Freedom Fighters on last season's "Crisis on Earth-X" event.
One of the most anticipated appearances wraps up the intro, showing Burt Ward as a civilian Dick Grayson, albeit in a Robin-colored sweater, exclaiming "Holy crimson skies of death!" as crimson skies do indeed descend on, what else, Earth-66 -- home of the 1966 Batman TV series.
The anti-matter wave that inevitably comes in the wake of the sinister looking skies appears to claim Earth-9 and Earth-X specifically, so further appearances from those characters are unlikely.
"Crisis on Infinite Earths" continues in Batwoman on Monday, Dec. 9, and then picks up in The Flash on Tuesday, Dec. 10. After a winter hiatus, the crossover concludes on Tuesday, Jan. 14 on both Arrow and DC's Legends of Tomorrow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Steven Universe Future Reveals Pink Diamond Was Even Worse Than We Thought</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WARNING: The following contains spoilers for the Steven Universe Future episode "Volleyball."
It's been obvious to longtime Steven Universe viewers that Pink Diamond/Rose Quartz was a complicated character, to say the least. While she was the beloved leader of the Crystal Gems, she was also a manipulative liar who kept humans in zoos and cruelly abandoned friends. The Steven Universe Future episode "Volleyball" contains even bigger revelations about her sordid past and the crimes she never answered for but her loved ones now have the burden of dealing with.
Simply put, Pink Diamond was a domestic abuser. That isn't even presented through the guise of some sort of fantasy metaphor like most of the other times Steven Universe has dealt with upsetting adult themes. Pink had a horrible temper (something already hinted at in the dream sequence in "Jungle Moon"), and she would beat up her original Pearl so badly that not even Steven's healing spit can heal her physically manifesting psychological wounds.

The Crystal Gems' Pearl had a very different, and mostly more positive, relationship with Pink/Rose. If Pink couldn't control her emotions around her original Pearl (whom Steven nicknames "Volleyball" in this episode for ease of distinguishing between the two), she was too secretive and emotionally withholding around her later Pearl. Because of this, Pearl initially doesn't believe Volleyball's claims, and their argument frustrates Steven so much that, with his newly activating powers, he accidentally traps the two Pearls in a regenerator, a scary parallel for how his mother could "accidentally" brutalize others in her anger.
Trapped together, Pearl apologizes to Volleyball for disbelieving her, accepting that just because she knew one side of Pink/Rose doesn't mean she couldn't have behaved different at other times with other people. Together, they escape the regenerator by forming a giant fusion. It's notable that the Pearl fusion is designed to look like a fusion between Utena and Anthy from Revolutionary Girl Utena, an anime about overcoming abuse that's been a significant influence on Steven Universe.
Volleyball's story is only the most dramatic example of Pink Diamond's big, consistent problem of treating other intelligent beings as lesser-than and disposable. Beating up Volleyball, abandoning Spinel and enslaving humans are  different examples of her exhibiting the same pathology as the other Diamonds. As Rose Quartz, she might have changed her behavior, but unlearning these attitudes was a lifetime struggle (even with the love of her life Greg Universe, it took effort for her to see him as an equal). Actually facing the consequences of her past sins was something she avoided, which has caused constant trouble for her son Steven.
Steven Universe isn't a show that really does traditional villains. Everyone has been shown to be redeemable, even the Diamonds. Whether or not redemption is possible, however, there is still the question of whether forgiveness is always achievable or deserved. Even with Volleyball now dealing with her trauma, Pink Diamond's left scars that might not ever heal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crisis: Black Lightning Promo Includes Familiar Clues for CW Crossover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new promo for the next episode of Black Lightning features clues for the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover event.
The promo for "The Book Of Resistance: Chapter Four" focuses on China Anne McClain's Jennifer Pierce, who appears to be having issues with her growing powers. The first scene shows three different Jennifers: one in her Lightning costume, another in a Blackbird suit and the other in an all-white ensemble worn by prisoners of the ASA's Pit. As the skies above Freeland turn to red, Gambi tells Jefferson Pierce and Lynn Stewart that they're dealing with parallel universes.
More scenes feature Jennifer battling her doppelgangers, Jefferson and Lynn arguing, white-clothed Jennifer being taken out of the Pierce household by ASA agents, and finally, Jennifer and Jefferson fighting one-on-one with their lightning powers.
While "Crisis on Infinite Earths" will not have an episode dedicated to Black Lightning, this promo may reveal how the hero will be brought into the massive crossover. "Crisis on Infinite Earths" marks the first Arrowverse crossover to include Black Lightning, with Cress Williams reprising his role in hours three and five, according to the crossover event's showrunner and executive producer, Marc Guggenheim.
Guggenheim previously revealed that Black Lightning's inclusion was a late decision for "Crisis" due to the distance between the crossover's filming location in Vancouver and the Black Lightning series filming location in Atlanta. However, the writing team on Black Lightning was able to reduce Williams' role in several episodes to accommodate his appearance in "Crisis."
Airing Mondays at 9 pm ET on The CW, Black Lightning stars Cress Williams as Jefferson Pierce/Black Lightning, China Anne McClain as Jennifer Pierce, Nafessa Williams as Anissa Pierce/Thunder, Christine Adams as Lynn Stewart, Marvin "Krondon" Jones III as Tobias Whale, Damon Gupton as Billy Henderson and James Remar as Peter Gambi.
"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Supergirl, then continues in Batwoman on Monday, Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in The Flash on Tuesday, Dec. 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. After the winter hiatus, the crossover will conclude on Tuesday, Jan. 14 in Arrow at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in DC's Legends of Tomorrow at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following the release of Todd Phillips' Joker, the internet had some fun with the iconic scene in which Joaquin Phoenix's Clown Prince of Crime dances down a flight of stairs to "Rock and Roll Part 2" towards the end of the film -- recutting it with various different songs.
A recent instance of this meme saw Phoenix's Joker dancing to "Sexy Boy," the theme song used by WWE legend Shawn Michaels. After being posted online, this particular clip caught the eye of none other than Michaels himself, with WWE's first Grand Slam Champion giving it his seal of approval.
The video was shared to Twitter by WWE/NXT superstar Keith Lee. "The internet deserves this," Lee wrote. "This was shown to me by one of my favorite people. To whoever created this masterpiece... thank you. To the interwebs... you're welcome."
Before too long, the clip found its way to the Heartbreak Kid, who quote-tweeted Lee's post. "I give it 9 out of 10 on the HBK rating scale," Michaels wrote.
Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. It will be available on digital HD on Dec. 17 and Blu-ray and DVD on Jan. 7.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Marauders #3, by Gerry Duggan, Michele Bandini, Elisabetta D’Amico, Federico Blee, VC’s Cory Petit and Tom Muller, on sale now.
The Hellfire Club is one of the most exclusive, influential groups in the X-Men’s corner of the Marvel Universe, and it’s recruiting. While the Hellfire Club is usually a secret cabal of elite, influential mutants that tries to reshape the world from behind the scenes, the current iteration of the club, the Hellfire Trading Company, is a relatively more philanthropic operation.
Since the late Charles Xavier reorganized the X-Men and the rest of mutantkind on the living island Krakoa, the Hellfire Company has represented the economic interests of mutants to the rest of the world. Led by Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw and Kate -- not Kitty -- Pryde, the new Hellfire is concerned with the legal and black market global distribution of Krakoan medicine and bringing endangered mutants to Krakoa.
Click the button below to start this article in quick view.
Without a single leader over the entire operation, the Hellfire Company has a new hierarchy that theoretically gives Frost’s White Queen, Shaw’s Black King and Pryde’s Red Queen equal power and the right to name a Bishop and a Knight to serve under them. While Frost’s little-seen brother Christian will serve as her White Bishop, Marauders #3 sees Shinobi Shaw resurrected and join his father as the Black Bishop.
Although Shinobi was never a famous as his father, the younger Shaw was a semi-regular thorn in the X-Men’s sides for a few years following his 1991 debut in Jim Lee, Whilce Portacio and Chris Claremont’s X-Factor #67. With density-manipulating powers that alternatively made him intangible and unbreakable, Shinobi led a version of the Hellfire Club and was a member of the Upstarts, a murderous team of young mutant villains.
While Sebastian and Shinobi have both tried to kill each other in the past, the younger Shaw took his own life earlier this year in Uncanny X-Men.
However, Sebastian hides that fact from a newly-resurrected Shinobi and tells him that Frost and Pryde were behind his death. With his lie, Sebastian positions himself as his son’s only ally in the Hellfire Company, which seems to have as much infighting and backstabbing as any iteration of the Hellfire Club.
If the Black King had his way, Shinobi would’ve joined Hellfire as the Red King, but Frost gave that position to Pryde before that could happen. Even though Shinobi spends most of this issue in a Red King’s crimson wardrobe, he joins the Hellfire Company as the Black Bishop.
While both Shaws have been members of the Hellfire Club in the past, this marks the first time that both have been members of the same Hellfire organization at the same time. Since Frost and her brother currently make up another branch of the organization, Hellfire’s Inner Circle is more insular than its been in years.
Traditionally, membership in the Hellfire Club has been hereditary. X-Men like Archangel, Sunspot, Psylocke and Captain Britain have all been welcomed into the Club since their privileged, upper-class ancestors were members. In its current form, the Hellfire Company doubles down on that idea by concentrating mutant wealth and economic power in a few wealthy families.
However, Pryde’s presence in the Hellfire Company seems to counter this idea. As the sea-faring savior of lost mutants, she already embodies Hellfire’s most altruistic impulses, and she has a relatively normal middle-class background that makes her a solid ambassador for the rest of mutantkind’s interests.
Perhaps as a further counter to the other members’ entrenched sense of privilege, Pryde tries to recruit the X-Men’s Bishop as her Red Bishop. Despite the obvious pun, Bishop handily refuses Kitty’s offer. While his time growing up in a broken future world would’ve brought a fresh perspective to Hellfire, Bishop usually gravitates towards semi-independent missions or mysteries that require his full attention.
Even with the concentration of Shaws and Frosts in the Hellfire Company, both Pryde and Emma Frost still seem genuinely concerned about the plight of other mutants. As the newest pawn in Sebastian’s power struggle against those two X-Men, Shinobi may end up finding himself in the middle of Krakoa’s first civil war.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three things we learned from the Premier League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool’s relentless march to a first English title since 1990 gathered pace with a comfortable win at Bournemouth, while Manchester City’s defence of the trophy was hit by a painful defeat against rivals Manchester United.
Fuelled by Jamie Vardy’s blistering form, Leicester has emerged as the closest challengers to Liverpool.
AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from the Premier League weekend:
Solskjaer’s big weekSeven days ago Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was fielding questions over whether he is the man to return Manchester United to their former glories after a 2-2 home draw with Aston Villa left the Red Devils in ninth and with just four wins from their opening 14 Premier League games.
A week on and Solskjaer has secured the two biggest victories of his time in charge since a famous 3-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in March helped turn his caretaker spell in charge into a full-time position.
United have beaten Tottenham on Jose Mourinho’s return to Old Trafford and now Manchester City 2-1 to climb up to fifth and within five points of the top four. On both occasions the scoreline arguably flattered the losing side with Solskjaer’s vision slowly coming to fruition.
Marcus Rashford has already matched his previous season’s best for goals with 13, Fred has enjoyed two of his best games since a £50 million move from Shakhtar Donetsk 18 months ago, Aaron Wan-Bissaka was outstanding in nullifying the threat of Raheem Sterling and Harry Maguire marshalled his defence resolutely under a late City bombardment.
There is still much to do for Solskjaer to convince the doubters, not least catching Chelsea in fourth to secure a return to the Champions League next season, but this was undoubtedly his best week as permanent United boss.
Klopp relishes Liverpool shutoutJurgen Klopp admitted Liverpool’s first clean sheet in 14 games was the talk of the dressing room after the leaders’ 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Klopp’s side made it 33 league games unbeaten as they maintained an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester.
Goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita and Mohamed Salah earned the victory, but it was Liverpool’s first shutout since September 28 that pleased Klopp the most.
“I forgot actually how it feels, to be honest. It’s great, we should have that more often,” Klopp said.
“For the boys, that was the most used word in the dressing room when I came in, ‘clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet’.
“Obviously everybody was desperate for that and now we have it, so let’s have it more often.”
Leicester happy to stay in the shadowsWith Jamie Vardy on the kind of hot streak he last managed when Leicester won their fairytale title in 2016, Brendan Rodgers’ side has become the last hope of a competitive race to be crowned kings of English football.
Liverpool has left Manchester City trailing in their wake, but Leicester remains in the hunt after Vardy’s double inspired a 4-1 rout of Aston Villa.
Vardy, the Premier League’s leading scorer with 16 goals this term, has netted in eight successive games, recalling his 11-match scoring streak from 2015-16.
The Foxes have reeled off a club-record eight consecutive top-flight victories, but Rodgers has no intention of talking up his team’s title chances.
“I don’t think anyone expects us to be near the top. We respect that, we get on with our work and keep developing as a team,” Rodgers said.
“It’s just natural, Man City and Liverpool are both incredible teams. We know we are looking to improve and close the gap. We have finished ninth in the last two seasons but today we looked like a top team.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Road accident claims 12 lives in Niger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Niger says 12 people have died in an accident on Sunday at Sawmill village along Mokwa -Makera road in Mokwa Local Government Area of the state.
The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Mr Joel Dagwa, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Minna that the accident involved a Truck Container with registration No. KJ 555 XX heading to Lagos.
Dagwa said that the Truck that came from Maiduguri, picked passengers from Zaria in Kaduna State before heading to Lagos.
” The accident involved 103 people, 55 females, 40 males, 8 children’s, 5 adults, 12 of them were killed while 91 sustained injuries and taken to Mokwa general hospital for treatment.
“All the 12 corpses have been deposited at the hospital’s morgue,” he said.
He blamed the accident on speeding on a sharp bend corner of the road.
The sector commander said that the Corps would continue to monitor road users to guard against overloading and dangerous driving.
” We have since embarked on aggressive patrols across all major highways to ensure that road users adhere strictly to traffic rules and regulations to avoid road accidents before, during and after the Christmas and New year festivities,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Falana insists Sowore was assaulted by DSS inside court</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Femi Falana (SAN) on Monday insisted that Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore was assaulted inside the court contrary to the claims by the Department of State Service (DSS).
“We have already identified those involved in this act of gangsterism,” Falana said during a Television Continental (TVC) programme ‘Your View’.
“We know them. They know I know all of them.”
In a video shared by his Sahara Reporters on Friday, Sowore was seen being dragged by several men in an Abuja courtroom. Sahara Reporters said some of the men in the video were operatives of the DSS.
But the DSS on Saturday denied rearresting Sowore in the courtroom.
“The DSS, as a professional, responsible and law abiding organization, could not have invaded a courtroom including the one presided over by a respected Judge who is not only handling its case but whose Order was unconditionally obeyed within a 24-hour ultimatum,” Afunanya said,” DSS spokesman Peter Afunanya said in a statement.
“Its (DSS) personnel were never, at any time, involved in the incident.”
Afunanya said the court had adjourned peacefully without an untoward incident when suddenly the unruly crowd imported into the courtroom went into a frenzy on the mere suspicion that DSS officials were seen at the court premises.
Although contrary to reports, Afunanya said, “the eventual re-arrest of Sowore by the DSS was effected outside the courtroom.”
But Falana said Sowore’s rearrest ‘inside the court’ was acknowledged by the head of DSS team inside Justice Ijeoma’s office.
“The judge summoned the DSS leader to her office and challenged him (on the incident) and he apologised profusely right in her office in my presence,” Falana said.
He described the DSS’s claim of arresting Sowore outside the court as a “reckless lie.”
Countering the DSS claim, Falana posited that if truly “Sowore’s arrest was stage-managed by his supporters assaulting him in court, was the DSS not supposed to protect him.”
The Nigerian government in a statement on Sunday said Sowore “is a person of interest to the DSS” because he called for “a revolution to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nigeria.”
But Falana said the government’s claim is a media trial which is far from the truth.
“No responsible government can expose its citizen to a media trial. Let them bring their evidence.”
Sowore is being charged on offences of treasonable felony, money laundering, terrorism and plotting to overthrow Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari after calling for a nationwide protest tagged RevolutioNow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Watch: Buttigieg on the defensive, Biden's strategy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) - Presidential politics move fast. What we're watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:
___
Days to Iowa caucuses: 56
Days to general election: 330
___
THE NARRATIVE
The Republican president is likely to be impeached, but Democrats are further away from rallying behind one nominee (or two) than they've ever been, even after California Sen. Kamala Harris' sudden departure. The top tier still features four - former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren - while billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is building a massive political machine spanning 30 states that threatens to prolong the Democratic nomination fight well past March.
___
THE BIG QUESTIONS
- Can Pete take the heat?
Buttigieg has been forced on the defensive in recent days over questions about transparency. It's been a long time coming for the 37-year-old, who has largely escaped the kind of scrutiny that typically comes with top-tier status. This week, he'll have to answer more tough questions about his fundraising operation and, perhaps more importantly, his private-sector work. Buttigieg has said for weeks that he'd open his fundraising events to the press, just as other candidates do, yet he's scheduled to have another round of closed-door meetings with donors this week. The bigger issue is the secrecy surrounding his client list during his time at powerhouse consulting firm McKinsey. He released a general summary of his work late last week, saying that only the firm can reveal the specifics. We'll see if the political world is satisfied with the summary. Count us skeptical.
- Did Biden's bus tour change anything?
The former vice president enters the week fresh off an eight-day bus tour across Iowa, which was by far his most aggressive retail campaign push of the year. He had been stuck in a glut of candidates near the top of the field in the kickoff caucus state before the tour. We'll be paying close attention to any new signs of movement. Biden's advisers have sought to downplay expectations in the state, but the marathon bus tour makes it hard to believe that they don't see a strong showing in Iowa as critical to his strategy.
- Debate stage so white?
As of today, not a single black candidate has qualified for the party's final debate of the year. With Harris' exit from the race, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and newcomer Deval Patrick, a former Massachusetts governor, are the only black candidates left, and Booker is the only one with a chance to meet the rising thresholds from the Democratic National Committee. It doesn't look good. By the end of Thursday, he needs four polls hitting either 4% nationally or 6% in an early voting state. Andrew Yang, an Asian American businessman, would be the only non-white candidate to make the cut if he hits one more qualifying poll. And Julián Castro, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the only Hispanic candidate in the race, isn't expected to qualify either. For a party that badly needs to energize African Americans and other minority voters heading into 2020, an all-white stage could be a problem.
- Is Trump's swing state free pass coming to an end?
As Democrats focus on their primary, the president continues to try to make the most of his uncontested access to top general election swing states. He'll host another rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, part of his focus on Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to close out the year. One thing has changed in recent days, however. Bloomberg has ratcheted up his advertising campaign in all 50 states, including those three. He's also hiring teams of political operatives on the ground there. It's part of a strategy Bloomberg's team says will keep him competitive in the Democratic primary and simultaneously prevent Trump from getting a free pass in general election battlegrounds for several months. It's an ambitious strategy to say the least, but if anybody has the money to do it it's Bloomberg. He's spent more than $60 million on ads in the last two weeks alone.
- Does Bernie have an edge in Nevada?
Sanders has kept his head down in recent days, but he and his grassroots supporters are positioned to be a force early in the primary season, particularly in those states with lower-turnout caucuses. Look no further than Nevada, which holds the third voting contest and will play host to the Vermont senator for at least two days this week. He won't have the state to himself. Warren and Biden are scheduled to campaign in the state this week as well.
___
THE FINAL THOUGHT
It may not feel like it, but the Democratic field is starting to winnow. As of Monday, just six candidates have qualified for next week's debate. Another two more are close, but remember that there were 12 onstage in October. With perhaps Bloomberg being an exception, those candidates who don't qualify for debates are effectively eliminated from serious contention, no matter how they try to spin it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inside the estate where 'hundreds of kids are starving and mums live off energy drinks'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of children are starving on the streets of one of the poorest housing estates in Wales - and their mums are living off energy drinks so they can feed them - a charity has claimed.
The Given to Shine charity, which takes food to deprived areas of Wrexham, is now delivering half of its 200 parcels a week to struggling families on the Caia Park estate. 
A spokeswoman for the charity told North Wales Live. they were giving food to 600 people on the estate - 450 of which were children. 
"We are seeing mums in hospital," she said. 
"They are living off energy drinks just so their children can eat. It is heartbreaking.
"We have definitely seen a massive increase since the summer months. The little amount people earn is having to spent on energy bills."
The Queensway 1 area in Caia Park, Wrexham was recently ranked the 9th poorest in Wales on a Welsh Government (WG) index, reports North Wales Live.
But those that live, work and volunteer there say that while the figures do show the scale of deprivation on parts of the estate, they don't tell the terrible story how children are going hungry, with hundreds now relying on handouts.
According to figures published earlier in the year by the End Child Poverty campaign, Caia Park has the worst rates of child poverty in Wales, said county councillor for the Wynnstay ward on the estate, Malcolm King.
The estate has long had some of the most deprived ranked wards in Wales, where just 50 yards away across the road in Rhosnesni, life expectancy is seven years more, he said.
Parts of Caia Park are smart and tidy and don't fit a stereotypical picture people who have not visited the estate may have.  But walking on the streets around Queensway, past the empty Red Dragon pub, litter strewn across the car park and nearby boarded up properties, this is not an area a first world country should aspire to for its people.
Residents were understandably reluctant to talk to North Wales Live about the problems they faced, perhaps ashamed of the situation they've reluctantly found themselves locked into, while council chiefs insist they are supporting and developing the community.
Cllr King, a former Wrexham council leader who runs The Venture playscheme on the estate, said: "The most important figures are the child poverty figures released in April which show Caia Park was had the first and second worst areas in Wales. In fact three out of the top four were on the estate.
"There are no other housing estates in the UK where this happens, it has the largest concentration of child poverty anywhere."
Austerity has hit the estate hard, said Cllr King, with services cut and with the close of the anti-poverty Communities First scheme in Wrexham, The Venture has become a one-stop shop for families and people looking for advice and a range of issues from health to social services.
"It has been a steady decline," he said.
"Children are now coming to The Venture, not to play, but to get something to eat because they are starving.
"They are suffering from malnutrition and its unbelievable that's happening in a first world country and we know that children born into poor families are more likely to have health problems."
Cllr King says crime has not gone up to the levels it was at 40 years ago, but possibly to where it was 10 years previously.
Over at St Mark's Church, church army officer Chris Lawton told, although the church had suffered vandalism, there was a growing sense of community.
But he also told how children were going hungry and the church had launched a Holiday Hunger scheme to feed youngsters who don't have access to paid school dinners, when when they are off and can see 120 kids.
"It's very sad," he said. "We initially only had one or two families turning up at most to our food bank, now we can have 14-15 families."
Wrexham and Caia Park in particular, has had a major problem with car arson in recent years and on Bryn Eglwys outside the church, the charred remains of another burned out vehicle stained the road.
However local Brian Hyde says he feels safe in the area.
"That is the first incident I have seen on this road in 15 years," he said: "Everbody knows everybody else here and they look out for each other.
"Queensway does have its problems, but over here I do feel safe and it is quite quiet."
Working over at The Venture, community councillor Colin Powell said: "Not a lot has changed here in the last 15 years. It does feel as though the estate has been abandoned by Wrexham council.
"Wrexham is fairly affluent place but Caia Park is not getting the help it needs."
Cllr King added: "There are some positives in Caia Park, there is a community spirit, and there are a lot of hard working people, working ridiculous hours an low wages, in jobs that other people would not do.
"But it needs a large increase in funding to bring it back to where it was years ago and the council could be doing more and the council needs to do more."
In response Wrexham council released a comprehensive statement.
It said: "The council ran the Communities First operation in Caia Park and Hightown between 2013 and 2018, until the closure of the programme.
"The council has maintained a Communities for Work team based on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc since this time and this project, funded by European Social Fund is expected to continue to 2023 with funding of £1,977,350 confirmed.
"This employability support programme was expanded in 2018 with the addition of the WG’s Communities for Work Plus programme, which increased the number of participants eligible for employability support. As per the Communities for Work programme, Communities for Work Plus is delivered across two operations on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc, and is worth a total of £431,300.
"The Legacy Fund was launched for an initial period of 2018/19 to 2019/20, and the council has used this fund to provide andadditional officer to work in each of the Caia Park and Plas Madoc operations, as well as a training budget and barriers fund to further complement the Communities for Work teams, which totals £90,000.
"The project is based out of the Caia Park Partnership offices. Through this combination of employability support, more than 200 people have been supported into paid employment to date.
"The council also used the Legacy Fund to create and Employability Support Grant worth £146,447, which was available to previous providers of Communities First services. Applications for financial support were approved for the two  years of the fund from The Venture Playground Ltd. as lead for the Wrexham Youth & Play Partnership (which also includes Gwenfro Valley ICC) and the Caia Park Partnership.
"The council has supported the Caia Park Partnership to secure Asset Transfer arrangements and physical improvements to its buildings on Prince Charles Road, which has led to the creation of the Hwb element of the Partnership and also the extension of the Sparkles Day Nursery, which received funding through the Vibrant & Viable Places Programme.
"The council is currently supporting the assignment of the lease at the Red Dragon Public House, and planning permission is being sought for its conversion into a new, modern convenience store; and is currently working to support the granting of a lease to Wrexham Youth & Play Partnership for the Gwenfro Valley site.
"We have also used the Enabling Natural Resources and Well-being Grant, worth £477,035, for Wrexham’s Green Infrastructure Project, based three days per week in Caia Park.
"The council identified the Nant Silyn site in Pont Wen, Caia Park for new council house building, and a scheme of 14 units was approved by planning committee earlier this year.
"Gwenfro & Hafod y Wern Schools have been modernised / built as part of the 21 Century School programme with total investment of £10,285,000.
"The council has invested heavily, and continues to be committed to delivering and achieving the Welsh Housing Quality Standard by December 2020. Major investment and significant programmes of work have been ongoing since 2013, this includes large programmes of work in the Caia Park estate.
"Caia is the largest area where properties have, and continue, to receive major refurbishment works when empty, as well as new and efficient central heating systems, electrical rewires, and the recently commenced external works programme.
"In addition, the council’s Void Refurbishment Programme has seen investment of £5,220,000 in the Caia Park Estate in the last 12 months.
"The council has also facilitated repair works to the Venture Playground through Community Benefits approaches."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meet The McLaren 620R: The Most Powerful Sports Series Yet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you thought the McLaren 600LT was the most hardcore Sports Series model, wait until you see the new McLaren 620R. Based on the track-only 570S GT4, the McLaren 620R is essentially a GT4 race car for the road, offering motorsport credentials in a road-legal package. McLaren describes the 620R as the "most track-focused, track-ready but roadgoing McLaren Sports Series model." It was built to celebrate the success of the 570S GT4 customer race car, which is the most successful GT car built by McLaren with more race wins and podiums than any other to date since debuting in 2017.
The McLaren 620R looks like a race car, handles like a race car, performs like a race car and feels like a race car, resulting in a seamless transition from race to road and vice versa. It shares the same lightweight single-piece carbon fiber Monocell II chassis as the 570S GT4, with a targeted dry weight of 2,826 pounds. Adjustable aerodynamic elements, race-derived suspension components, and powertrain recalibration to increase power and performance further enhance the 620R's dynamics.
Powering the 620R is the same 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the GT4 car, but with significantly more power. Since the car isn't restricted by racing regulations, the engine ECU and turbocharger management have been reconfigured to produce 610 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque, making the 620R the most powerful Sports Series car yet. This enables the 620R to hit 0-62 mph in 2.9 seconds and 0-124 mph in 8.1 seconds before maxing out at 200 mph.
Power is sent through a seven-speed Seamless Shift Gearbox with super-fast shift times ideal for setting blistering lap times. For added drama on the road, selecting Sport mode allows the driver to hear the upshift 'crack' created by a split-second cut of the ignition spark during a gearshift.
Other motorsport components derived from the 570S GT4 include two-way manually adjustable coilover dampers, which feature 32 clicks of adjustment per corner to allow a driver to tailor compression and rebound rates to suit their driving style and track conditions and is 13.2 pounds lighter than the regular Sports Series units. The suspension also features lightweight aluminum wishbones and uprights and stiffer anti-roll bars and springs than those fitted on a regular Sports Series model.
The rubber top mounts have been replaced with solid stainless-steel alternatives resulting in "noticeable improvements" in steering control and feedback. An adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing raised 12.5 inches into the cleaner airflow above the vehicle increases downforce while minimizing drag, which is now road legal thanks to an incorporated third brake light.
The front bumper, splitter, and hood have been redesigned, with the splitter retaining the 570S GT4's aero blades and cut-outs, while the carbon fiber hood has twin nostrils to aid downforce and clean up the airflow over the top of the car. Front dive planes contribute up to 66 pounds of downforce as part of the 143 pounds delivered by the full-frontal aero package.
Stopping power is provided by a lightweight braking system with carbon-ceramic discs (15.3-inch front and 14.9-inch rear) and forged aluminum brake calipers. As standard, the 620R rides on Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tires, but these can be swapped with optional, full-slick motorsport tires for track driving.
Specially developed for McLaren by Pirelli's Motorsport team, the slick tires are optimized to complement the motorsport brakes and race-derived suspension of the 620R. They unlock a contact patch eight percent larger than the road tire, increasing lateral G-forces and enabling quicker lap times. This is the first time that a road-legal car with 19-inch front wheels and 20-inch rear wheels has been engineered to be able to run on slick tires without the need for additional mechanical adjustment.
Being based on a GT4 race car, the interior has been stripped out and lacks luxuries such as a floor carpet and glovebox. Air-conditioning, IRIS Navigation, and an audio system are not included as standard but can be added at no extra cost. An upgraded Bowers & Wilkins upgraded audio system is available as an optional extra. The driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fiber racing seats with six-point racing harnesses, fitted as standard. A McLaren Track Telemetry system comes as standard and is displayed on a center-mounted seven-inch touchscreen.
Three colors are available inspired by the 570S: McLaren Orange (with white racing stripes), Silica White (orange stripes) and Onyx Black (orange stripes). Each can be optioned with race number decals and/or partner decals. Additional body colors are available from MSO.
The McLaren 620R will be limited to just 350 units. Production will begin in January, with each car starting at $328,951 including taxes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The George Cooper conundrum for Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe to try and solve</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ryan Lowe has admitted that Plymouth Argyle loan signing George Cooper has given him food for thought over a possible return to his starting line-up.
Cooper provided a creative spark for the Pilgrims when he played as a second half substitute in the away League Two game against Cambridge United on Saturday.
It was not enough to save them from a 1-0 defeat at the Abbey Stadium, but Cooper staked a claim for a first team place.
The versatile 23-year-old was Plymouth Live’s Argyle player-of-the-month for October but has been on the bench for the last five games.
Cooper played at right wing-back after replacing Joe Edwards in the 65th minute at Cambridge.
The loan signing from Peterborough United has also previously been used by Lowe in one of the central midfield roles in his favoured 3-1-4-2 formation.
Lowe said: “It has been a bit frustrating for George because he came in and had a wonderful four games – or three-and-a-half, I would say.
“We know what George gives us. He gives us that quality and it’s one of them – where do you find George in his best position?
“Is it wing-back? Is it one of the number eight slots? But, as you have seen, the eights in Danny Mayor and (Antoni) Sarcevic have been outstanding.
“The wing-backs have been outstanding but, yes, it definitely gives you food for thought (the way he played against Cambridge).
Cooper gave Argyle an extra attacking impetus when he was sent on for Edwards.
Lowe said: “That’s why we put him on there, to get up and down that right side, coming in on his left foot.
“We have to look at the overall package and (Callum) McFadzean has been outstanding on the left side and Joe Edwards on the right side.
“It’s tough to balance, but we know what George gives us.
“Defensively, he’s not quite switched on as much as I would like but that’s because he’s an attacking player.
“He always gives us food for thought. He’s a superb talent.”
Cooper was the second of three substitutes used by Lowe against Cambridge, with Joel Grant the first one when he replaced Conor Grant in the 55th minute.
Grant went up front with Dom Telford while Byron Moore moved to the left wing-back role.
Then, in the 73rd minute, striker Billy Clarke replaced Telford, who had started his first match since late September after a hamstring injury.
Lowe said: “Joel came on just after half-time and gave us food for thought. Byron going out on the left gave us food for thought.

“They all give us food for thought when they come on and give us an impact.
“Billy didn’t have much to do but he came on and got hold of the ball. That’s what I want, when my players are coming off the bench to have an impact.
“They certainly did that but it just wasn’t to be that we could get an equaliser.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Swedish ambassador to China faces trial over Gui Minhai meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden's former ambassador to China faces an unprecedented trial over allegations she overstepped her authority during a meeting to secure the release of imprisoned bookseller Gui Minhai.
Anna Lindstedt, ambassador to Beijing from 2016 to early 2019, has been under investigation since February over a meeting she allegedly set up in Stockholm between Gui Minhai’s daughter and businessmen claiming to have connections to the Chinese Communist Party, without informing the Swedish foreign ministry.
Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen known for publishing gossipy titles about Chinese political leaders out of a Hong Kong book shop, disappeared while vacationing in Thailand in 2015 before resurfacing in mainland China.
The Swedish prosecution authority on Monday charged Lindstedt with "arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power", saying she had overstepped the boundaries of her authority during the meeting at which she had been "in contact with persons representing the interests of the Chinese State".
"An ambassador is the head of a public authority with a far-reaching mandate to represent Sweden; nonetheless, even ambassadors must adhere to certain guidelines and instructions issued by the Government Offices of Sweden and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In this specific consular matter, she has exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable," said prosecutor Hans Ihrman in a statement.
"A charge of arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power is unprecedented in modern times."
The Swedish foreign ministry has said it knew nothing about the meeting nor that the ambassador was even in Stockholm at the time. Lindstedt herself has denied the allegations a crime was committed.

Relations between Sweden and China have been strained for several years over the detention, over the detention of Gui Minhai, who disappeared from a vacation home in Thailand in 2015. Several months later he appeared on Chinese state television confessing to a fatal drunk driving accident from more than a decade earlier.
He served two years in prison, but three months after his October 2017 release he was again arrested while on a train to Beijing while travelling with Swedish diplomats. His supporters and family have claimed his detainment is part of political repression campaign orchestrated by Chinese authorities.
His daughter Angela Gui, who has been actively campaigning for her father's release, wrote in February on her blog that Lindstedt had invited her to Stockholm in January.
During discussions in the lounges of a fancy hotel in the Swedish capital, in the presence of the ambassador, she was introduced to Chinese businessmen who claimed they could help negotiate her father's release. In exchange, Angela Gui said she was told to "stop all media engagement".
The Chinese embassy in Stockholm said in a statement at the time that Beijing "has never authorized and will not authorize anyone to engage with Gui Minhai's daughter".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nativity Scene Shows Holy Family Separated, Caged at Border</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Claremont United Methodist Church has erected a Nativity scene portraying the Holy Family separated and held in cages at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The Rev. Karen Clark Ristine, senior minister at the church, posted a photo of the Nativity scene on Facebook, saying the depiction had stirred her “to tears.”
“In a time in our country when refugee families seek asylum at our borders and are unwillingly separated from one another, we consider the most well-known refugee family in the world,” Rev. Ristine wrote.
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, the Holy Family. Shortly after the birth of Jesus, Joseph and Mary were forced to flee with their young son from Nazareth to Egypt to escape King Herod, a tyrant. They feared persecution and death,” she said, calling this the “theological” interpretation of the scene.
The California minister went on to invite her readers to imagine Jesus, Mary, and Joseph as victims of present-day immigration policies.
“What if this family sought refuge in our country today?” she asked.
“Imagine Joseph and Mary separated at the border and Jesus no older than two taken from his mother and placed behind the fences of a Border Patrol detention center as more than 5,500 children have been the past three years,” she said.
“In the Claremont United Methodist Church nativity scene this Christmas, the Holy Family takes the place of the thousands of nameless families separated at our borders,” she said.
The provocative Facebook post elicited nearly 8,000 comments and 20,000 shares, split between supporters and critics.
Many of the comments took issue with the reverend’s politicization of the Christmas story, while also calling into question the intentions of the church in making this partisan statement.
“This is a good example of what it means to take the Name of God for your own vain and gain,” wrote one woman. “Claremont UMC are false teachers and false prophets. Claremont UMC is getting human trafficking money and funds in the guise of charity and are tax exempt while pushing false narratives and political agendas, and they profit at the expense of taxpayers, and they exploit the people they claim to help.”
The Rev. Ristine is not alone in comparing contemporary American politics to the rulers of the time of Jesus. Several days ago, Pope Francis compared President Donald Trump to King Herod, the ruler who massacred male infants in an effort to kill the baby Jesus, as recounted in Saint Matthew’s gospel.
Speaking with a Jesuit community during his recent visit to Thailand, the pope offered a thinly veiled condemnation of the U.S. president and his administration, suggesting that like King Herod, Mr. Trump separates families at the border while allowing drugs to freely flow into the country.
“In other parts there are walls that even separate children from parents. Herod comes to mind,” Francis said. “Yet for drugs, there’s no wall to keep them out.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fashion Industry Warns the World to Heed Dire Climate Warnings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The global fashion industry will on Monday draw on what it describes as its own “social and cultural weight” to lead the world into tackling climate change, using the stage of the United Nations COP25 conference in Madrid to announce its master plan for global self-sufficiency.
Retailers and industrial groups say they will expose the conclusions of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (Ficca), signed last year by 43 companies, in an effort to tackle critisism which sees the fashion industry accused of encouraging over-consumption, excessive waste generation, hazardous chemical use and worker exploitation.
It is estimated some 73 percent of textile fibers used to produce more than 100 billion garments each year around the world end up in landfill or incinerators after they have been used.
Iconic UK brand Burberry sparked a furor last year when it admitted it had destroyed almost $40 million worth of unsold goods on the simple premise that the items were no longer in fashion.
According to fashion journal MDS, the new fashion agreement includes reaching a carbon neutral economy by 2050, and reducing emissions by 30 percent until 2030. Ficca was signed in the previous Climate Change Conference in Katowice (Poland) and was supported by Inditex, Kering, Adidas, Burberry, H&M, Gap, Levi Strauss and Target, among others.
Monday’s presentation at the two-week climate conference in Madrid will see the conclusions of the seven focus groups: decarbonization pathway and GHG emission reductions; raw materials; manufacturing and energy; logistics (through Clean Cargo Group1); policy engagement; leveraging existing tools and initiatives and promoting broader climate action.
The rush by the fashion industry to join the climate debate comes just months after it was exposed as having a carbon impact bigger than the airline industry.
Now it wants to use the elite, globalist COP25 conference as the start of its own journey on the road to redemption.

That could take some doing.
The apparel and footwear industries together accounted for more than eight percent of global climate impacts — the equivalent of 3,990 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2016, according to a report from Quantis.
Total emissions related to textiles production are equal to 1.2 billion tons annually — more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping trips combined, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
In April fashion houses in New York were condemned for the monumental amounts of waste they generate every year in the form of discarded, unused fabric as well as clothes that are worn once and then discarded in the name of fashion.
Activists have also targeted the highly profitable “fast-fashion” industry, which churns out new low-cost garments daily or weekly to maximize sales volumes, calling on retailers to improve labor and environmental conditions at supplier factories in the impoverished developing world.
As Breitbart News reported, global fashion houses are infamous for seeking suppliers in countries such as China, Bangladesh, Egypt, Cambodia, Guatemala, India and Indonesia, which have massive problems with pollution as well as near non-existent labor laws.
In one of the world’s worst industrial accidents, more than 1,100 people died in April 2013 in the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, where workers reportedly produced garments for Western retailers such as Walmart, Benetton and Joe Fresh.
The United States subsequently suspended trade privileges for Bangladesh out of concern for labor rights.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's still no Persona 5 on the Switch, and God only knows when Atlus are porting Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal to PC, but at least Joker and co are making an appearance in another Japanese RPG.
That game is Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space, the mobile RPG created by Masato Kato, the writer behind the majority of Chrono Trigger. We've checked out Another Edenwhen it launched at the beginning of the year. It's purely a solo RPG, so despite the small element of gacha that's inevitable in mobile JRPGs, Ethan found there wasn't a fight he couldn't beat for free and the game was genuinely story-driven.
Now, that mobile JRPG is getting its own piece of Persona 5. The Phantom Thieves and Joker will be added to the game as part of a simultaneous worldwide update for Another Eden. It's called Bound Wills and the Hollow Puppeteer, and players will be able to enjoy the chapter's prologue after finishing the second chapter of Another Eden's main story, with the rest of the story accessible after finishing Another Eden's 13th chapter.
There's a lot of similar beats between Another Eden and Chrono Trigger, with characters asking getting philosophical about shaping the future and travelling 800 years into the future after a boss fight. Each character has their own class and special abilities, with new fighters accessible through Chronos Stones, a currency you earn from in-game challenges or just straight out paying real-world money for. You'll get enough Stones in the first hour to buy your first character.
If you want to get a sense of what you're in for, here's a chunk of gameplay from the beginning on Android. Another Eden is available on Android, iOS and iPad now, with the free Personal 5: Royal crossover being patched into the game from December 11 for all users.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phoenix Point, the latest strategy game from XCOM creator Julian Gollop, was released last week on the Epic Games Store. It was also supposed to be out on the Microsoft Store and Xbox Game Pass, but it’s not, and Snapshot Games have basically had to admit “we dropped the ball”.
In a statement released on the company’s official forums, A Snapshot staffer writes:
They go on to say all this extra work “was not anticipated by us and has caused unexpected delay over and above our delay waiting for certification”, and that as a result “We do not have an ETA for Phoenix Point on Game Pass or the Windows Store yet”.
I’ve been playing the game for the last few weeks: it has some very cool ideas on the strategic side of things, but also some very frustrating loose ends.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KOTLAS, Russia -- Thousands have rallied in the northwestern Russian town of Kotlas against the construction of a new landfill for waste from Moscow.
One of the organizers of the rally, Vyacheslav Grigoryants, told RFE/RL that at least 3,000 men and women demonstrated in the town of 60,000 on December 8.
Other sources said more than 10,000 people attended the rally, where demonstrators demanded a halt to the ongoing construction of the dump in the town of Shiyes, near the regional capital, Arkhangelsk.
Authorities in Arkhangelsk have said that some 10.5 million tons of garbage are to be transferred to the new landfill from Moscow in the next 20 years.
The construction of the new landfill near Arkhangelsk started in July 2018. Protests against it began just a month later.
Similar rallies have been held in recent months in other Russian cities and towns.
In early February, nationwide rallies against landfills took place in 30 regions across Russia.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BISHKEK -- Kyrgyz prosecutors in a high-profile corruption trial have asked a court to sentence two former mayors of Bishkek to lengthy prison terms.
The prosecutors asked the Lenin district court in Bishkek, on December 9, to sentence Albek Ibraimov to 20 years and Kubanychbek Kulmatov to 15 years in prison.
Kulmatov ran the capital city in 2014-16 and Ibraimov in 2016-18. The two were charged along with 11 others for alleged corruption while in office.
Both former officials served as mayors of Bishkek during the tenure of former President Almazbek Atambaev.
Three days earlier, two former Kyrgyz prime ministers, Sapar Isakov and Jantoro Satybaldiev, were sentenced to 15 and 7 1/2 years in prison in another high-profile corruption case.
That case was launched amid tensions between Atambaev and current incumbent Sooronbai Jeenbekov, an ex-prime minister who was tapped by Atambaev as his favored successor in Kyrgyzstan's October 2017 presidential election.
Atambaev was arrested on August 8 after he surrendered to police following two days of violent resistance by supporters. He had refused to show up at police headquarters for questioning in an unrelated case.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bosnia Puts Off Closing Makeshift Migrant Camp 'Until Further Notice'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bosnian authorities have indefinitely postponed the scheduled closing of a makeshift migrant tent camp in the northwest of the country.
The closing of the Vucjak camp had been scheduled for December 9, following harsh international criticism of the improper conditions hundreds of people are being housed in. The camp is hosting some 600 migrants, according to the Red Cross.
Rade Kovac, the director of the Bosnian Service for Foreigners' Affairs, visited the camp on December 9 and said that the authorities had postponed closing the camp until further notice.
Aid groups have repeatedly warned that the Vucjak camp is located on a former landfill and close to a mine field from Bosnia's 1992-95 war, and has no running water or toilets. Living conditions worsened further after snow started falling last week.
Kovac said the migrants will eventually be moved to one of the reception centers in the Sarajevo Canton. He gave no reason for the postponement, but media reports said the decision was prompted by a lack of proper accommodation at the reception centers.
Bosnia-Herzegovina's security minister, Dragan Mektic, last week announced that the occupants of the camp on the border with Croatia would be relocated to other camps outside the region.
"It was agreed that migrants would be moved early next week from this locality to other reception centers...and that this makeshift camp would be closed," Mektic said in a statement on December 6.
The decision to close the camp came after Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, visited Vucjak last week and warned that deaths would be imminent if the camp were not closed at once. "If we don't close the camp today, tomorrow people will start dying here," she told reporters while visiting the snow-covered camp.
On December 6, Mijatovic told a news conference in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, that it was now urgent to relocate the migrants and provide them with "decent accommodation."
"Many people lack adequate clothing and footwear,'' she said. "It is inhumane and unacceptable to keep people in such conditions.''
However, some migrants said that despite snow and freezing weather, they will refuse to be moved farther away from the border. Most of the migrants flocked to the northwestern part of Bosnia because they want to continue their journey to Western Europe's more prosperous countries by crossing the border into European Union member Croatia.
On December 7, migrants at Vucjak resumed accepting food distributed by the Bihac branch of the Red Cross, after refusing it for several days in protest at the announced relocation of the camp.
Bosnian authorities have struggled to accommodate thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Migrants enter Bosnia from neighboring Serbia or Montenegro.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marvel and Disney has unveiled the first images of the upcoming Falcon and Winter Soldier and WandaVision at São Paulo’s 2019 Comic-Con Experience, which took place over the last weekend.
The first two stills depict Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, both reprising their roles as Falcon and Winter Soldier respectively. The duo are seen out of their combat uniforms and dressed instead in civilian clothing. While there’s not much more information about what the plot would entail, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige has confirmed that it will follow from Avengers: Endgame and see Falcon donning Captain America’s shield. We also know that Daniel Bruhl will be returning as Baron Zemo, the villain in Civil War, with Emily VanCamp also reprising her role as Sharon Carter. Wyatt Russell will be joining as the new character John Walker.
Second, comes a black and white still from the upcoming WandaVision series, which will see Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda transform into the formidable Scarlet Witch, with Paul Bettany starring alongside her as Vision. The image depicts the duo seemingly in a happy marriage, with the aesthetic of a sitcom from the ’50s. Feige has also confirmed that the series will have a significant impact on the “entire future Phase 4 of the MCU” and follows from Endgame, so it remains a mystery how Vision — who was killed in Infinity War — will play into the show. Joining Olsen and Bettany are Kat Dennings and Randall Park, reprising their roles as Darcy Louis (from Thor) and Jimmy Woo (from Ant-Man and the Wasp).
Take a closer look at the stills below, and for more entertainment news, Peter Sarsgaard is joining the cast of Matt Reeves’ The Batman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ljungberg wants Arsenal to start scoring first</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Interim boss Freddie Ljungberg admits it's a real problem for Arsenal that they are always conceding first and are then required to chase games.
The Gunners have taken just one point from Ljungberg's two Premier League games at the helm since he was appointed as Unai Emery's temporary successor last month.
He takes his side to West Ham on Monday night knowing they will be in the bottom half of the table at kick-off following their winless run.
But the 42-year-old believes he knows where to start correcting the issues to get to back to winning ways.
"If you score the first goal you don't have to chase the game," he said.
"You don't have to open up as much because you can control the game so that's something that, in my opinion, we need to change a little bit."
Ljungberg has spoken about the lack of belief among his players at the moment but insists they will continue working to address the slide.
"It's never easy when you sack a manager and you're low on confidence," he added.
"We started really well at Norwich. We started the second half really well and I was sure we were going to win the game and get going again.
"We get a sucker punch on a counter or as they play down one side. It's hard to take but we keep plugging away."
Ljungberg will be unable to call on Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos, who remains sidelined with a hamstring problem.
Rob Holding could return following a minor knee injury and will be assessed before the trip to the London Stadium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka begin first Pakistan Test tour since 2009 attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Islamabad - Sri Lanka embarked on the first Test cricket tour of Pakistan in 10 years on Monday following the deadly 2009 attack on their team that plunged Pakistan into sporting isolation.
"Touchdown Islamabad," tweeted the Pakistan Cricket Board, along with video of the players at the airport, while Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Waseem Khan called their arrival a "historic occasion".
Sri Lanka will play two Tests under heavy security, one in Rawalpindi - where Pakistan's army is headquartered - and the second in Karachi, ending a decade-long absence for cricket's five-day format since the attack.
Eight people were killed and several players and officials were wounded when militants opened fire on a convoy of buses travelling to a Test in Lahore in March 2009.
"This is my first tour to Pakistan," said Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne, who opted out of the team's recent limited-overs tour of Pakistan.
"After the 2009 incidents players were scared to tour Pakistan but in the last two years or so Sri Lanka and other teams have toured Pakistan."
He added: "We want to play good cricket in Pakistan and hope they give us some good security."
The 2009 attack slammed the door shut on international sporting fixtures in cricket-loving Pakistan as foreign teams refused to visit over security fears.
Pakistan's cricket team has been forced to play its home matches on neutral ground in the United Arab Emirates, resulting in financial losses and hard times for Pakistani fans.
International cricket began making inroads back into the country when Zimbabwe became the first team to play in Pakistan in 2015, paving the wave for a smattering of Twenty20 matches ever since.
But Test matches - considered the pinnacle of international cricket - have until now remained absent. The first Test starts in Rawalpindi on Wednesday and the second is in Karachi from December 19.
"Pakistan's losses due to non-hosting of international cricket have been substantial," Waseem told AFP.
"Pakistan cricket supporters have been denied the opportunity to see their heroes play live in our national stadiums."
'Cricket in Pakistan is dying'
None of the players on Pakistan's current roster, including skipper Azhar Ali (75 Tests) and Asad Shafiq (71), has played a Test at home.
"I am happy Test cricket has finally return to Pakistan," said fan Ashfaq Ahmed, 48.
"Cricket in Pakistan is dying and our kids aren't as keen toward the game as we were once. But one can't blame the younger generations because they haven't seen their team playing in Pakistan."
The PCB are now hoping to turn things around thanks to a dramatic improvement in security in recent years, following a wave of crackdowns on militants across the country.
Sri Lanka, despite being the target of the 2009 attack, have been a driving force behind the return of international cricket after they played six limited-overs matches in Karachi and Lahore in September and October.
The return of international games and Pakistan Super League matches - as well as behind-the-scenes diplomacy - are finally paying dividends, according to Waseem.
"The eight (PSL) matches in Karachi earlier this year... were eye-openers for the 43 foreign cricketers who returned as our ambassadors," he said.
The series - the second for both teams in the ongoing World Test championship -- promises to be intriguing, not least because of the tussle between the two coaches: Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq and Sri Lanka's Mickey Arthur.
Arthur was Pakistan's coach until August when he was axed by the country's cricket officials, who included Misbah, following a disappointing performance at this year's World Cup.
The South African, who was only appointed by Sri Lanka last week, will hope to pile the pressure on Pakistan who are coming off a humiliating 2-0 Test thrashing in Australia which pushed them down to eighth in the rankings.
Misbah, who is also Pakistan's chief selector and batting coach, will be under especially heavy scrutiny following Pakistan's run of poor form.

The festive season is a busy time for Santa Claus. The whole world, one night, a f*ck-load of presents – how does he keep the energy up?
Well, if Walmart’s adult-themed yuletide jumpers are anything to go by, it isn’t thanks to milk and cookies. No no, Santa favours ‘quality, grade A, Colombian snow’.

Walmart Canada has now issued an apology after some controversial (and hilarious) sweaters were listed for sale on their website.
A Walmart spokesperson told Global News: 
Of all the jumpers, the highlight is one featuring a wide-eyed Father Christmas, sitting in front of three lines of a white substance – I’m guessing it’s not sugar.
Created by clothing company FUN Wear, and called the ‘Let It Snow Ugly Christmas Sweater’, it had Twitter users in stitches.

The product description, now taken down from the website, read: 
While some weren’t exactly pleased about this narcotics-loving Santa, others loved it. One Twitter user wrote: ‘This is the best ugly Christmas sweater copy ever written.’
There were other jumpers too: one featured St. Nick ‘roasting his chesnuts on an open fire’, another saw Santa lying on a table with his pants down as an alien prepares to probe him.

The product description for the latter read: 
We all love a bit of fun around Christmas, but you need to draw the line somewhere.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Torquay United's mid-season 'shuffle' under way as striker Manny Duku departs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE DEPARTURE OF Dutch striker Manny Duku, nearly three weeks away from the opening of the main January transfer window, is likely to be just the start of a mid-season shuffling of Torquay United's squad in the wake of a 2-1 defeat at Harrogate Town.
After moving to within two points of the National League leadership only five weeks ago the Gulls have ground to a halt after six successive defeats, including five in the league, and manager Gary Johnson is hinting strongly at more changes ahead.
Former Herenveen, Hayes & Yeading and Cheltenham Town centre-forward Duku, 26, moved to Plainmoor only last summer, but he has not made the impact which he and everyone hoped for.
After an injury-affected pre-season, four starts and 12 substitute appearances failed to yield a goal, his contract has been cancelled by mutual consent and he has returned to Holland with his wife and new baby son.
"We are sorry it didn't work out for Manny here," said Johnson.  "We wish him and his new family all the very best for the future."
Johnson had hoped that Duku, 6ft 3in tall, would be the sort of muscular centre-forward that Harrogate possessed in their veteran targetman Jon Stead at all-weather Wetherby Road.
The former Premier League targetman, who had been sent off in United's 4-2 win at Plainmoor in September, knew too much for United's young Bristol City loanee Robbie Cundy, who was taken off after an hour in a triple substitution at 2-0 down.
Centre-back Jean-Yves Koue Niate, centre-forward Jared Lewington and Ruairi Keating took over from Cundy, QPR loanee Amrit Bansal-McNulty and Kalvin Kalala.
By that time Stead (56mins), with a rasping first-time shot from the edge of the area on Brendan Kiernan's cross, had already added to Alex Bradley's tenth minute opener, deflected past Lucas Covolan off Cundy's outstretched leg.
Lewington gave Harrogate's centre-backs some problems, helping in the move which saw Ben Whitfield fouled and Jamie Reid convert his 16th goal of the season (67mins) from the penalty spot.
But Harrogate, up to sixth, were deserving winners. United are down to eleventh place, 13 points behind leaders Barrow.
Johnson was frustrated by the failure of the officials to clamp down on what is known as 'game management' tactics by the hosts in the second half.
"We've had to contend with only 25 minutes of ball-in-play.  When teams waste time for that long, and only five (extra) minutes go up, it's a shame - I know referees can't be doctors and physios, but they've got to read the game," he said.
But he quickly turned to Plainmoor's bigger picture.
"It's a tough period of time, but what it will show in the end is the ones who can handle adversity.  You always come out of it, but not always with the same people," he said.
"We have got to make sure that we've got the right people on our bus.
"We had it last season, but this year some of them have found it a bit difficult with the next step-up - that's unfortunate because I have given them every opportunity to do it.
"We are going to have to do as much as we can pretty soon, otherwise our season will be gone before we know it.
"But I am not giving up on it yet."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fear over future of disabled people's day centre</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A project for 78 young adults with special needs who have nowhere else to go is being split up and mums are angry.
The award-winning ROC Creative project at Palace Avenue in Paignton runs five days a week and parents have been told it is being moved and split into four smaller groups on January 31.
The young adults all have mild to severe learning difficulties, many have educational disabilities and further physical disabilities including Downs syndrome and autism. They study drama, dance, photography and art.
Many have attended on a  daily basis ever since ROC Creative started 10 years ago. Now parents have learned it is about to be moved - some to cob barns in Cockington and some to Totnes.
In 2016 ROC (formerly Robert Owen Communities) merged with United Response and parents claim "everything has changed".
Mums Jill Holmes (who son, aged 22, has been part of the group for over two years) and Colette Phillips (whose daughter is 30 and has been attending since it started) say the new location at Cockington is not suitable and they are angry that parents were not informed.
Jill said: "We can't keep quiet about this - it's our children's lives. Most of them will never be able to work. This is all they have and there is nowhere else they can go.
"We went to have a look at the cob barn which is near the shops at Cockington. Apart from the fact that Cockington is beautiful, everything else is unsuitable - there's no transport, it's freezing cold in winter and in summer they will have to leave the doors open and our young people will be an exhibit.
"At the moment they are in the middle of Paignton. They can walk to the Co-op. There are buses. This old barn is completely wrong. It's just about cost.
"They are not thinking about the people they are supposed to be supporting."
Colette said: "My daughter has been there for 10 years - it's amazing the atmosphere and special relationships between them all as a group. My daughter completely came out of herself after joining ROC Creative.
"Now we have just found out this week that they are going to be split up. It will be devastating for them to have to deal with. It will be hard on us as parents as well.
"They are not all young adults - the eldest person in the group is 55. That means a lot of the parents are elderly and they cannot take their children out and about. Some live in supported living and they have nowhere else to go. There are no other opportunities for them.
Jill said: "ROC Creative has been out of this world for all different disabilities - it has changed my son's life.
"We have known that United Response has been looking at the current building for the last nine months because of maintenance issues."
Mike Crowhurst, Divisional Director for United Response, said:
"Our ROC Creative project is committed to truly inclusive art and has a track record of delivering bespoke activities which inspire creativity and independence among the local learning disability community.
"We do not own the space at The Palace Theatre and increased running costs enforced by the council have ultimately forced us to consider alternative nearby venues.
"The current space has no disabled access - distinctly limiting those who can attend - whilst there have also been other problems with heating and hot water supply, toilets and parking.
"We recognise that news of a potential move may come as a surprise to those who attend, and we have not wanted to alarm anyone unnecessarily if changes were not needed. This meant not speaking publicly until we had understood our options.
"We now want to assure everyone that we are doing everything we can to preserve the future of a project about which we’re deeply passionate.
"We will update staff, participants and families on the future of ROC Creative as soon as we can. Whilst nothing has yet been agreed, we’re excited about its future and want as many people as possible to be part of it."
Parents have been told they will be invited to consultation meetings in Totnes later in December.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Police latest after woman injured by double decker bus in Torquay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision between a woman and a bus in Torquay which left the 26-year-old with serious injuries.
It happened at around 9.30pm on Saturday, December 7. Emergency services were called to reports of a collision between a Stagecoach bus and a single female pedestrian.
Police say the 26-year-old local woman suffered considerable lower leg injuries and was taken to Derriford Hospital for treatment.
It is believed she is local to the area and had been out for a meal before making her way to work nearby.
No other parties were injured in the collision.
Eyewitness Pete Vernon, who called 999, said the whole thing happened in “two or three seconds”.
He said: “The girl in question is about 21 years old. Was coming out of Revolution and as she did her friend said something and she turned. The bus was passing as she turned. She hit her head on the side of the bus and as she fell her legs went under the wheels. There was nothing the driver could have done. It wasn’t his or her fault because the front of the vehicle had long passed although the whole thing happened in two or three seconds.
“I called 999 and had to give a statement. It was just a very unfortunate accident. My thoughts are with the girl’s family.”
Another eyewitness who gave a police statement saw the crash happened. He said: “As she came out of Revolution she was looking the opposite way and the bus hit her face and then went over her legs.
The road was closed for a short time whilst emergency services dealt with the injured party and the scene.
Devon and Cornwall Police say: "The police would like to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity and witnessed the collision or may have dash cam footage of the incident or event leading up to it. 
"Anyone who witnessed the incident and anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting log 887 7/12/19."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Exeter's fondly remembered 'celebrity' hairdresser passes away in husband's arms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tributes have been paid to a well-known hair salon owner who has passed away after battling with ill health.
Lavinia Cook was the proprietor of not one but five salons in and around Exeter before leaving Devon in 2004 and moving up north.
She had three in St Thomas and two on the outskirts of Exeter, as well as seven mobile hairdressing vans for home clients.
Such was her talent that she was asked by Ford Motors to design a hairstyle – The Capri – to coincide with the launch of the Ford Capri in 1969.
It gained her much acclaim, as well as reluctant local celebrity status, and the name Lavinia Hair Fashions was known far and wide.
Her father Wilfred, a notable trilby-wearing figure and much-loved businessman at this time, was her business partner and chief promoter, who wouldn’t let her talents go unnoticed.
Lavinia, nee Hulland, was born in Exeter and met her husband Barry, who owned Nitty Gritty Now, in Exeter 52 years ago and they were married for 48 years. Together they had a child, Petena-Marie, and become grandparents to three grandchildren, Reece, James and Kyle.
They moved to the north west in 2004 and had many happy years there, but she struggled with her health, although was always a challenge to her GP because she would said she was ‘fine’ whenever asked how she was.
Lavinia had a life-saving operation in 2011, but told very little more than her family needed to know because she did not want to distress them.
Barry said: “As she was a trooper in spirit through illness she did not want anyone to suffer because she was.
“Lavinia was greatly loved and admired by all, and was often told, ‘don’t ever change’. She was at the very heart of my life. Losing my beautiful lady too soon has fractured my world.
“She will be painfully missed."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Messi will be impossible to replace, says Barcelona president Bartomeu</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Josep Maria Bartomeu will offer Lionel Messi a lifetime contract at Barcelona and knows it will be difficult to replace the talisman.
Barcelona will find it impossible to replace Lionel Messi, according to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who added Pep Guardiola would always be welcome back at Camp Nou.
Messi followed up winning a record sixth Ballon d’Or by recording his 35th LaLiga hat-trick in Barca’s 5-2 win over Real Mallorca on Saturday.
Despite spending big on Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong in the most recent transfer window, Barca are still heavily reliant on the 32-year-old, who has scored 14 goals from 15 appearances in all competitions this term.
Bartomeu has acknowledged Barca will find it extremely difficult to replace Messi whenever the forward calls time on his stay at the club, but outlined their intention to continue developing young talent from the famed La Masia academy.
“We Barca fans have the good fortune to enjoy Messi every three days,” Bartomeu, who plans to offer Messi a “lifetime contract” told Italian publication La Repubblica.
“Leo is impossible to replace and when he will be here no more, we will be forced to play differently. I cannot say that we are already preparing for post-Messi, but it is true that we have already decided to bet on young players for a long time.
“For now, what we have to do is not worry, but enjoy it. I would like to make him an annuity contract as we have already done with [Andres] Iniesta. He has earned the right to decide when to say enough is enough.
“As a footballer, Messi is number one and we will fully understand it only in a few years, because Leo has changed not only the history of Barca, but that of world football.”
Bartomeu also confirmed Guardiola – who left Barca in 2012 after four trophy-laden seasons in charge before going on to coach Bayern Munich and now Manchester City, will always have a home at Barca, should he wish to return.
“A possible return of Guardiola? It doesn’t depend on me,” he added.
“It was Pep who decided to leave, but for him the doors of Barca are always open.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reports: Barcelona ready to exchange out-of-favour star for Juventus duo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest word around the rumour mill is that La Liga giants Barcelona are ready to offload Ivan Rakitic in exchange for the Juventus duo of Daniele Rugani and Merih Demiral, during the upcoming January transfer window.
This is according to Calciomercato, who reports that Juventus are interested in Rakitic thanks to his experience and proven quality. The Italian newspaper further adds that the Bianconeri will try to add to Barcelona’s interest in the potential sale of their star midfielder, by adding Rugani and Demiral as part of their player-plus-cash offer.
It is believed that Barcelona will accept the offer, as the Catalans themselves are on the hunt for alternative options in defence. Right now, Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet are the preferred first-choice options for manager Ernesto Valverde at the heart of Barcelona’s defence – but that is likely to change within the next few seasons as Pique is approaching his retirement and Lenglet is yet to deliver a consistent set of good performances for the club.
Calciomercato further adds that the La Liga defending champions are also interested in Juventus’ Federico Bernardeschi, but no official move has been made by them to approach him yet.
Meanwhile, earlier last week, Rakitic himself had announced that he is not looking to leave the Blaugrana anytime soon.
“Lots of things have happened in the last few months,” Rakitic said, before adding:
“But I want to give my all and if I can play here then I’ve always said that there’s no better place than Barcelona to keep winning trophies, it’s the perfect place for me.”
As a result, it remains unclear as to whether he will accept Juventus’ offer if they approach him in January.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spurs manager Jose Mourinho has reportedly made one of his former stars at Manchester United a priority to sign in the January transfer window.
Mourinho was sacked at Old Trafford a year ago, and is apparently eyeing a reunion with one midfielder who has also since left the north west of England.
Following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's appointment, Marouane Fellaini saw his playing time decrease, and left at the end of the January transfer window.
The 32-year-old made the move to Shandong in China, but according to Les Sports, Mourinho is hoping to bring the towering midfielder back to the Premier League.
Mourinho is notorious for forging close bonds with some players, and has apparently made contact with the 6ft 4in star about a potential move to north London after developing a good relationship in Manchester.

Fellaini is still under contract until December 2021 with the option of signing for an additional year, but will not be in action until at least the end of February when the Chinese football season begins again.
Mourinho's midfield is already well-stacked, with the likes of Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso arriving in the summer to supplement the likes of Harry Winks, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko.
However, Mourinho has apparently set his heart on adding the Belgian midfielder to the ranks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cryptocurrency Exchange - Here are tips to choose the best</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The exchange you must have decided to make use of will greatly determine whether your crypto investment will be profitable or not in the long run. There are lots of investors who have ignored this aspect of digital currency investment and eventually lost lots of money. In case you don't know, exchange is simply the gateway through which your cryptocurrencies will be traded. This is perhaps why you need to take out time and ensure the right one is chosen.  There are lots of exchanges to choose from which will even make your task of selecting one that can meet your needs more difficult. Here is the great part The good part about all of this is that you don't have to rack your brains on this subject matter again. This is because the major aim of this post is to list out some of those variables to consider while searching for a crypto exchange platform. Just ensure to follow these tips and your investments will be safe 100% of the time. Location is vital The first thing to consider about an exchanging platform is whether it is operating legally within your country. Countries vary when it comes to crypto regulations. Simply put, what may apply within a country may not apply in another one. Even in the United States, there are times states may vary when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations. Before deciding to sign up with any platform, ensure to always know whether its operations are in line with the legal stipulations of your location.  Reputation and authenticity There is one major problem about the cryptocurrency market at the moment which is the fact that barriers for getting into it are very few. This gives room for fraudulent dealers to get both potential and existing investors ripped off. Before deciding to register with any exchange, try to find out whether it has been registered as a company. It may shock you to know that most of these companies are only making false claims about their legal status. This is why you need to carry out every necessary investigation in order to safeguard your crypto investments. Also, you will have to be aware of bitcoin revolution scam speculations in the web and arrive at a clear view on your own. Check various social media platforms if you have to and find out whether others are using such exchange.  Consider security Crypto exchanges have been facing lots of security challenges over the years. While experts have predicted that this problem may not get better, there is still need for you to find out platforms which have improved security measures to ensure your investments are protected in the best way possible. A typical example of security challenges is the issue of $137million which was reportedly missing in QuadrigaCX after the demise of its founder. LiquidityThe higher the trade volumes; the higher the liquidity will be. It means your chosen exchange will be able to handle your orders much quicker. Avoid those exchanges that have very low trade volumes as this can affect your business more than imagined. Customer SupportThis entails trying to sign up with a platform where there is great support. It is only natural that you will experience one or two challenges along the line. Therefore, look out for a crypto exchange which will attend to your problems without any delay.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The first Nokia-branded smart TV launches tomorrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gadgets 360 reports that the Nokia television boasts a 55-inch 4K screen (16:9) with a 60Hz refresh rate and an Android-based operating system. Its sound quality could be the TV’s biggest draw as it features JBL audio tech and 24-watt speakers.
Other specs include support for Dolby Vision and HDR10, Bluetooth 5.0, three HDMI ports, and two USB ports. You also get 2.25GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage.
“Flipkart’s understanding of the needs and behaviors of Indian consumers, and the power of its reach, will help it make Nokia branded smart TVs accessible and affordable,” said Vipul Mehrotra, Flipkart’s VP of Nokia brand partnerships.
The TV will sell for 41,999 Rupees, which is about $590, through Flipkart beginning tomorrow (December 10). It comes with a bundled stand, wall mount, and Bluetooth remote that supports Google Assistant, all of which make it sound like pretty good value. Sadly, there’s no word on if the TV will launch internationally.
Flipkart added that more Nokia-branded TVs would arrive in the future.
This isn’t the first TV to come from Nokia. During its heyday in the 1990s, the company produced both monitors and televisions.
In its more familiar phone market, we recommended the Nokia 6.2 as one of the best budget phones in our Best of Smartphones feature.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An anonymous reader shares a report: Verizon, which bought Yahoo in 2017, has suspended email addresses of archivists who are trying to preserve 20 years of content that will be deleted permanently in a few weeks. As Verizon announced in October, the company intends to wipe all content from Yahoo Groups. As of December 14, all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed. The mass deletion includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, database, calendar, attachments, conversations, email updates, message digests, and message histories that was uploaded to Yahoo servers since pre-Google 1990s. Verizon planned to allow users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, but apparently it has a problem with the work of The Archive Team who wants to save content to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site. "Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," reported the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. "Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups -- which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nokia Does Smart TVs Now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While terms like '3310' and 'Snake' come to mind when Nokia is mentioned, that may be about to change.
The smart phone company is getting into the smart TV game. Well, it's letting its name be slapped on one at the very least.
Indian company Flipkart has secured a licensing deal with Nokia for its new 55-inch smart TV.
It will have a 4K UHD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of max brightness, Dolby vision and HDR10 support, two 24-watt JBL by Harman speakers, 16GB on-board storage, a quad-core processor, three HDMI ports, two USB-ports, Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity.
It will also run an Android 9 operating system with access to Google Play.
"The first-ever Nokia branded Smart TV with Sound by JBL is powered by 24 Watt built-in speakers, DTS TruSurround and Dolby Audio to enhance the overall audio experience at home," Flipkart said in a statement. "This feature addresses a major pain point among Indian consumers, many of whom except a better sound quality from their televisions today."
According to Gadgets 360, Flipkart has stated that its looking to sell more Nokia-branded TVs in the future, though there are no details as yet. We are also unsure if we will ever see them in Australia, though it seems unlikely.
The Nokia 55 Inch Ultra HD TV (4K) will launch in India on December 10 and will have an RRP of 41,999 Indian rupees, which is about $862.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scarlet Witch Will Finally Get Her Big Title In WandaVision</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This weekend is CCXP, Comic Con Experience São Paulo, and during a recent panel there MCU head honcho Kevin Feige dropped some fascinating details about Marvel’s upcoming slate of programming and movies. Alongside some exclusive footage that hasn’t yet been released online, there was some interesting conversation about WandaVision, the Disney+ series that will star Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and the Vision (Paul Bettany) in some version of marital bliss.
Speaking to Collider, Feige explained how this show would be an opportunity to greatly expand and deepen the characterisation of Wanda, and offer a chance to turn her into the larger-than-life Marvel juggernaut that comic fans know and love.
“[We have] the opportunity to tell their story, and show more of what Wanda can do, more of what makes Vision, Vision, and most importantly, reveal a name that I’m not even sure we’ve said in the MCU yet, but we make a big deal of in the show, is the fact that Wanda is the Scarlet Witch,” Feige said. “And what does that mean, that she is the Scarlet Witch? That’s what we play into with this show in ways that are entirely fun, entirely funny, somewhat scary, and will have repercussions for the entire future of Phase 4 of the MCU.”
Wanda’s always been an important character, but this is something new. It suggests Wanda’s power, and her importance to the universe, being taken to a whole new level. And it’s satisfying, too; “Scarlet Witch” is just such a good name for a character. It rolls off the tongue, and has a strong set of associations.
Feige also commented that the introduction of the multiverse would continue to shape the storytelling of the Disney+ shows and the MCU at large, saying, “The multiverse is the next step in the evolution of the MCU, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is gonna crack it wide open in ways that will have repercussions for a Disney+ series just before it, that’s not WandaVision, and for movies just after it in a big, fun way.”
While this doesn’t make it clear that Wanda will be mucking around with the multiverse herself, it certainly leaves the door open for the idea.
WandaVision is set for Disney+ in 2021.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It takes a special kind of audacity for your startup to be successful, and a special kind of audacity to name your startup “Unicorn”. Sadly, the overlapping of those two audacious circles did not spell success for one scooter company.
Unicorn’s founder, Nick Evans, sent an email to customers saying that Unicorn “totally failed as a business,” and that they would not be delivering any scooters and could not refund any money. According to The Verge, the company spent all its money on advertising, marketing and other expenses. Once all of that was covered, none was left over for actually making and delivering the scooters.
“Unfortunately, the cost of the ads were [sic] just too expensive to build a sustainable business,” Evans said in the email.
Unicorn joined a very crowded market a bit too late and with too little funding to compete with scooter companies that have been burning through cash in a losing business. Its scooters were to cost $US699 ($1,022) and had features like GPS tracking, similar to Tile, a company co-founded by Evans.
I’ve never understood the strategy of “the startup”, even though I’ve spent most of my career in and around it. To me, it has often seemed like a non-strategy; a place where enthusiastic people throw billions of dollars of spaghetti at the wall. And sometimes billions of dollars of ads at Facebook.
In any case, Unicorns don’t exist, anymore.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Presidential Symphony Orchestra to perform in new Ankara building next year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Architects working on Turkey's Presidential Symphony Orchestra building in the capital Ankara told Anadolu Agency (AA) that the new facility will be completed by the end of the next year, with artistic, social and civic features.
Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy announced that the construction of the concert hall will be finished within a year, 28 years after it began. The new facility will have two halls with a capacity of 2,500 people, a backstage and a VIP lounge.
Architect couple Semra Uygur and Özcan Uygur said such public facilities provide prestige to a city and reflect the image of a country. "Having a stranger watch a concert there changes the image of the country," Özcan Uygur said. Semra Uygur added that the concert hall will contribute to the cultural and artistic life of society and strengthen the social communication of people. "The Presidential Symphony Orchestra is the only institution bearing the name of Turkey's presidency. This facility will play an important role in the cultural life of Ankara and Turkey," she said.
Architectural features
In 1992, a national architectural project to build a concert hall in the area of the Atatürk Culture Center was launched. "The project was built in a timeless style that contributes to the cityscape and stands out for its design that will be appreciated for years to come," Semra Uygur said of the jury's final decision on the project.
She said the area is located between the mausoleum of Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and the Ankara Castle."We had the chance to locate the main concept of the structure emotionally and physically in relation to the urban area. A structure that does not harmonize with its surroundings is meaningless," she added.
The Presidential Symphony Orchestra's new structure is egg-shaped, combined with a pyramid-shaped building. "We combined the wall and roof to create the feeling that it is surrounded by the environment; therefore, the structure consists of singular and independent forms," Semra Uygur stated.
Özcan Uygur said the egg-shaped form also boosts the acoustics inside the structure."Only symphonic music can be performed here," Semra Uygur said, noting that it is the first hall built solely for concert purposes in Turkey.
However, visitors to the building will do more than just listen to music, Özcan Uygur stressed. "People will come to socialize, meet new people and come together," he said. "When the construction of this facility is over, it will be a place where people can take a break. Public facilities not only serve their visitors but also the community."

    <h5 class="mb-1">More than half of NHS devices are still running Windows 7</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NHS TRUSTS are still running Microsoft's soon-to-be-defunct Windows 7 operating system on more than 20,000 devices.
That's according to cloud computing firm Citrix, which obtained the information through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. The request was sent to 98 NHS Trusts across the UK, of which 77 responded. 
As per the FoI, 52 per cent of the total 447,000+ devices being used in the NHS, including desktops, laptops, and tablets, are still running Windows 7, which reaches end-of-life status on 14 January 2020. 
That's despite the fact that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) last year announced a £150m plan to upgrade all NHS systems to Windows 10 by the time that Windows 7 reaches the digital graveyard. However, it's worth noting that the NHS is an E5 licence holder, which means it'll get an extra year of Windows 7 support for free. 
Back to the FoI, and 78 per cent of NHS organisations say they are currently working to migrate their systems to Windows 10 within the next six months, and a further six per cent of Trusts are considering migrating in the near future.
23 per cent of the trusts responding to the FoI request said 10 or more applications they use on their systems still need remediation to ensure ease of use and stability when moving to Windows 10.
Fewer than a quarter (23 per cent) said they had already deployed or were planning to deploy cloud or virtualisation technology to help migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The use of these technologies will help NHS Trusts in centralising the management of desktop environments, thereby leading to a more efficient and cost-effective migration.
"The NHS is unquestionably dedicated to delivering first-class patient services," said Matt Smith, Director, Public Sector, UK & Ireland, Citrix.
"Yet prolonged austerity is putting it under even more pressure to do more with less.
"Given the additional security considerations that come with outdated technology, migrating to Windows 10 within the 'next six months' could be too little, too late. Ensuring IT infrastructure is up-to-date and secure is necessary to both better support NHS staff in their day-to-day jobs and ensure first-class healthcare services in the UK."
While the use of Window 7 in such large numbers across the NHS worrying, it's made huge strides since July, when the Department of Health and Social Care revealed that over 1 million NHS computers were still using Windows 7. At the same time, it fessed that NHS Trusts are still using more than 2,000 PCs running Microsoft's long-defunct Windows XP OS. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey tackles power supply problems in liberated areas of N Syria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Turkey is dealing with a power supply problem in a recently liberated area in northern Syria after the PKK-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) were forced out in a Turkish anti-terror operation, the Defense Ministry said Sunday.
Having largely cleared YPG elements from northern Syrian territories, the Turkish army has accelerated efforts to ensure stability in the region by meeting the basic needs of war-weary locals, including in rural areas of Tal Abyad.
According to a ministry statement, progress is being made to solve power-related problems. "Repairs began on Nov. 22 on the Mabruka Electricity Transformer Station, which feeds the south of the M4 highway and the Operation Peace Spring area," said the statement.
"Following the repairs, the provision of electricity from the Tishrin Dam to the Operation Peace Spring area was established through meetings with Russian military officials in Ayn Isa. In this respect, electricity was provided to the Tal Abyad countryside. Work is also ongoing to provide electricity to Tal Abyad center and the Ras al-Ayn region."
The area's water supply problems have also been largely solved. The Allouk Water Reservoir that feeds Ras al-Ayn, Darbasiyah and Hasakah, was fully restored and measures were taken to ensure it is at its full operational capacity, said the ministry.
Turkey on Oct. 9 launched Operation Peace Spring to eliminate YPG terrorists from northern Syria and east of the Euphrates, in order to secure Turkey's borders, aid the safe return of Syrian refugees and ensure Syria's territorial integrity.
Under two separate deals with the U.S. and Russia, Turkey temporarily halted the operation to allow the withdrawal of YPG terrorists from the planned northern Syria safe zone.
Ankara wants the YPG terrorists to withdraw so a safe zone can be created to allow for the return of some 2 million Syrian refugees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia ends gender-segregated entrances for restaurants</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Restaurants and cafes in Saudi Arabia are no longer required to have gender-segregated entrances, officials said, in a further easing of social restrictions in the kingdom.
Eateries have long required one entrance for single men and another for women and families, in a country where the once-powerful religious police zealously enforced sex segregation in public places for decades.
The ministry of municipalities and rural affairs said on Twitter Sunday it was eliminating several requirements for restaurants, including the need for "an entrance for bachelors and a separate entrance for families."
It was unclear whether a restriction on seating inside restaurants will also be removed. The decision applies also to cafes, entertainment centers and wedding venues, according to the statement.
Restaurants are currently segregated into a "family" section for those accompanied by women and a "singles" area for men, though many have quietly taken down the barriers in recent years amid the kingdom's sweeping liberalization drive.
The latest reform was hailed by young Saudis but dismissed by arch-conservatives on social media, with one Twitter user saying it went "against sharia," or Islamic law.
Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has sought to project a moderate, business-friendly image of his austere kingdom as he seeks to boost investment.
Prince Mohammed has clipped the powers of hardline clerics as he pursues a modernization drive that has allowed mixed-gender music concerts and ended decades-long bans on cinemas and women drivers.
The oil-rich kingdom has recently seen a shift from the country's strict guardianship system as well, which requires women to obtain consent from a male relative for major decisions. Women are now allowed to rent a hotel room, get a passport and travel outside the kingdom without the approval of a male guardian.
Until three years ago, the religious police elicited widespread fear in the kingdom, chasing men and women out of malls to pray and berating anyone seen mingling with the opposite sex.
The hardline enforcers of public morality, whose powers began waning even before Prince Mohammed rose to power, are now largely out of sight.
But the reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on activists, including women urging faster reform, some of whom have accused interrogators of sexual harassment and torture. Saudi prosecutors deny the accusations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finland's Marin to become world's youngest prime minister at 34</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Finland's Social Democrats elected Sunday a 34-year-old former transport minister to the post of the prime minister, making her the youngest head of government in the world's history.
Sanna Marin narrowly won Sunday's vote to replace outgoing leader Antti Rinne, who resigned Tuesday after losing the confidence of the coalition partner Centre Party over his handling of a postal strike.
"We have a lot of work to do to rebuild trust," Marin told reporters on Sunday night while deflecting questions about her age.
"I have never thought about my age or gender, I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate."
At 34, Marin also becomes one of the world's youngest state leaders, ahead of Ukraine's prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who is currently 35.
Former PM Antti Rinne had headed Finland's center-left five-party coalition since June, and Marin's appointment is unlikely to lead to significant policy changes by the Social Democrat-led administration.
"We have a shared government program which we have committed to," Marin said.
The SDP won April's legislative elections on promises to end years of economic belt-tightening introduced by the Center Party to lift Finland out of a recession.
Rinne stepped down after several weeks of political crisis over a plan to cut wages for 700 postal workers.
Finland's postal service withdrew the reform plans in November after widespread strikes, but questions emerged over whether or not Rinne had previously endorsed the cutbacks, leading to the Center Party declaring it had lost its trust in the prime minister last Monday.
Parliament is expected to formally swear in the new prime minister on Tuesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's Mac Pro will be 'available to order' this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GOOD NEWS MONEYBAGS-MAC FANS, the cheese grater inspired Mac Pro is going to be available to order from Tuesday, according to an email that's been going out to interested parties.
If you're unaware of the Mac Pro's imminent arrival and haven't been saving up, you may want to move along now. As you can see in the tweet below, the email was extremely light on details, but we already know what the entry-level Mac Pro will set you back: $5,999, or around £4,557 if you're on this side of the Atlantic. 
Again, that's the entry-level Mac Pro, although the term is pretty relative given the basic model packs an eight-core Xeon processor, 32GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and a Radeon Pro 580X graphics card. Expect to easily clear five figures for the fully upgraded version with a 28-core processor and 1.5TB of RAM. 
Maybe ask Calvin Harris if his is any good before you put in that pre-order.
If you're sucking air through your teeth at this point, you may want to look away now, because while Apple also promised the Pro Display XDR will be available to order at the same time, it's even weaker value. The 32in display may pack a 6K resolution with 1,000,000:1 contrast, but it'll also sell for $4,999 (around £3,797) with an extra $1,000 if you want the fancy anti-glare nano-texture coating. 
The real cherry on the cake is the $999 Apple wants you to pay for a stand, though. We'll just rest it in the corner of the room, thanks. Yes, there used to be a chair there, but we sold it to pay for the Mac.
You never know - maybe Apple will feel generous with its dollar-to-pound conversions. Though if we were to give you odds on that, it'd be close to that contrast ratio we mentioned above. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ericsson will pay a yard to settle bribery charges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COMPANY YOU'D FORGOTTEN STILL EXISTED Ericsson has been ordered to pay fines equivalent to $1bn (£760m) after US courts found it had engaged in bribery offences in a "years-long" campaign.
The US Department of Justice found that the company had been using bungs in five countries - Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Kuwait - to "solidify its grip on telecommunications business".  It's thought that the offences occurred between 2000 and 2016 - stretching back to the days when it was still manufacturing handsets with the best of them.
The payout marks a record for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) with a $520m penalty to the Justice Department and a further $540m going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ericsson is understood to have put aside over a billion in case of damages in its accounting for the year ahead.
US Attorney Geoffrey S Berman of the Southern District of New York said: "Through slush funds, bribes, gifts, and graft, Ericsson conducted telecom business with the guiding principle that 'money talks'.
He added that the fine "should communicate clearly to all corporate actors that doing business this way will not be tolerated".
"Ericsson's corrupt conduct involved high-level executives and spanned 17 years and at least five countries, all in a misguided effort to increase profits," said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.
Ericsson hasn't commented so far beyond a statement prior to the verdict, which said that it would cough up the readies to "resolve the government's investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of the Company's scheme to make and improperly record tens of millions of dollars in improper payments around the world".
As part of the settlement, Ericsson has also agreed to continue to assist with the investigation and any further charges against named individuals, improve its compliance programme and maintain an independent compliance monitor for three years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy S11 specs, release date and price: In-the-wild images show chunky camera hump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WE'RE STILL MONTHS AWAY from the arrival of Galaxy S11, but it's already shaping up to be one of Samsung's most interesting flagships yet.
Speculation suggests the S11 lineup, comprising the Galaxy S11e, Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+, will up the ante in the screen department with larger SAMOLED 120Hz displays, and in the camera stakes with a mammoth 108MP main sensor. There's also talk that the handset true will boast souped-up internals, an all-new facial recognition system and baked-in 5G support. 
We've rounded up everything we know about Samsung's Galaxy S11 lineup below. 
Release date and priceAs per unsurprising rumours, the Galaxy S11 lineup will debut in "mid to late February", suggesting a pre-MWC launch is likely on the cards. 
There's no word on pricing yet, but if anything like last year's Galaxy S10, expect the so-called S11e, S11 and S10+ to fetch £699, £799 and £899, respectively. 
Latest news9/12/19: The Galaxy S11 has made its in-the-wild debut, courtesy of tipster Ice Universe who has shared the first images of the flagship in the flesh.
Though the images aren't the, er, clearest, they show the Galaxy S11's rear camera hump, which will allegedly add 1.1mm of thickness to the device - hardly surprising given rumours that it'll sport a 108MP primary camera and a periscope-style telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom.
6/12/19:  Samsung is planning a major overhaul of the Galaxy S11's camera in a bid to better compete with the iPhone, Bloombergreports. Adding weight to previous rumours, the report - citing the usual sources familiar with the matter - says the Galaxy S11 will sport the Samsung-made 108MP sensor that recently appeared on Xiaomi's CC9 Pro. This will reportedly be accompanied by three other lenses including ultrawide-angle and Time of Flight (Tof) sensors. 
Separately, SamMobile is reporting that the highest-end Galaxy S11+ could sport a mammoth 5,000mAh battery, a huge improvement over the 4,100mAh battery inside this year's 4,100mAh offering. 
5/12/19: There's yet more evidence that the Galaxy S11 will be capable of capturing 8K video, as SamMobile is reporting that its sources have "confirmed" the feature for Samsung's next flagship. This is hardly surprising, as Samsung's Exynos 990 processor supports 8K video capture at 30 frames-per-second, and it's likely Qualcomm's newly-announced Snapdragon 865 - which will power S11 handsets in the US - will also support the feature. 
2/12/19: Tipster Ice Universe has shared an image of an alleged Galaxy S11 screen protector, which hints that the handset will boast a tiny punch-hole cutout and barely-there bezels.
The image (above) shows that the front-facing camera will be placed at the top centre of the display, as seen on the Galaxy Note 10. It also confirms, if legit, that the Galaxy S11 will have little in the way of screen surroundings; there's virtually no bezel at the top and sides and a tiny chin underneath the display.
27/11/19: The Galaxy S11+ has shown up in official-looking renders, just days after it appeared on Geekbench. The image (above), courtesy of CashKaro and @OnLeaks, show that the S11+ will look similar to its smaller S11 and S11e siblings with a curved edge display, centrally-aligned punch-hole and a USB-C port at the bottom. 
 
Elsewhere, the report claims the Galaxy S11+ will sport a 6.9in Dynamic OLED screen with an under-display fingerprint sensor and will measure in at 8.8mm thick. 
25/11/19: The first benchmark results for the Galaxy S11 5G have appeared on Geekbench
The listing for the handset confirms that the flagship will pack Samsung's new octa-core Exynos 990 SoC running at 1.95GHz; US-bound variants of the device will likely pack Qualcomm's incoming Snapdragon 865 chipset. While that all sounds well and good, the benchmark scores - 447 in single-core and 2,326 in multi-core performance - are somewhat disappointing; the iPhone 11, for example, scored 1,333 and 3,251 on Geekbench, and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 10 scored 736 and 2,691. 
22/11/19: A filing at China's 3C certification agency, spied by DroidShout, has all but confirmed that there will be a 5G variant of the Galaxy S11. It's not all good news though, as the listing - which references the devices as the SM-G9860 - reveals that the 5G model will ship with 25W fast charging support. While that's an upgrade over the 15W charging offered with the Galaxy S10, it's lacking compared to the 45W charging offered by the Note 10+. 
21/11/19: Samsung has inadvertently revealed another key feature of the Galaxy S11, as in its newly-released One UI beta for the Galaxy Note 9, eagle-eyed users have spotted references to a 120Hz display.
As per Ice Universe (above), a new mode in Samsung's software will allow users to switch between a 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rate, while a third mode will allow for the screen to switch automatically between 60Hz and 120Hz.
 20/11/19: Samsung has pushed out a new version of its Camera app and inadvertently revealed some clues about the Galaxy S11.
As spied by XDA Developers, the latest version of the app has references to 8K video recording - a feature also supported by Samsung's Exynos 9980 SoC. The chipset, which is expected to power US variants of Samsung's next flagship, will feature 8K@30fps video decoding/encoding capabilities. 
If 8K support is included, the 12MP camera found on the Galaxy S10 ain't going to cut it. Handily, the updated Camera app also includes references to 108MP photos, adding yet more weight to the rumours that the handset will sport Samsung's yet-to-be-announced, second-generation 108MP camera sensor. 
Another bit of code inside the app makes reference to a 20:9 aspect ratio display, possible confirmation that the S11 will ditch the 19:9 screen found on Samsung's Galaxy S10 handsets. 
10/11/19: Evan Blass has spilled some details about the S11 lineup, claiming the flagship will launch in three different sizes.
In a tweet, Blass says that the Galaxy S11 will comprise 6.4in (S11e), 6.7in (S11) and 6.9in (S11+) variants; by comparison, the S10e, S10 and S10+ ship with 5.8in, 6.1in and 6.4in screens, respectively. 
However, in a follow-up message, Blass notes that the smaller model could sport a larger 6.4in display - as large as the screen on the S10 Plus - stating that he's received "conflicting information" about the entry-level model.
The two smaller models will be made available in both 4G and 5G variants, according to Blass, while the top-end Galaxy S11+ will launch with 5G-only. He also notes that all models will have curved-edge displays, marking the end of Samsung's S10e-style flat panels.
Blass claims the Galaxy S11 series will make its debut in "mid to late February", suggesting a pre-MWC launch is likely on the cards.
8/11/19: The Galaxy S11 will allegedly sport a "new" 108MP main camera sensor.
So says Twitter tipster Ice Universe (below), who claims the S11 won't use the 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that Samsung launched earlier this year, but will instead boast an upgraded second-gen sensor. 
It's unclear how the new sensor will improve on the three-month-old lens that's expected to debut on Xiaomi's CC9 Pro and Mi Note 10 smartphones, as though Ice Universe thinks there's a "high possibility" it'll debut on the Galaxy S11, he doesn't share any additional details. 
The first-gen sensor is the smartphone sensor to adopt a 1/1.33-inch size, which means it can absorb more light in low-lit settings than smaller sensors, while its pixel-merging Tetracell technology compresses four pixels into one to produce brighter 27MP images.
It also supports video recording without losses in field-of-view at resolutions up to 6K at 30-frames-per-second.
31/10/19: A new rumour claims Samsung is working on a new facial recognition system that likely will debut on the Galaxy S11 next year.
References to the as-yet-unannounced face recognition system have been spied in Samsung's One UI 2.0 beta by both TechTastic and XDA's Max Winebach (below), who spotted references to "FaceService" for the Picasso - the codename for the Galaxy S11.   
Though current flagship Samsung devices feature facial recognition, this leak suggests the company is working on a souped-up version based on 3D rather than 2D in order to make it more accurate and secure like the Face ID and Face Unlock tech found on the iPhone and Pixel 4, respectively.
Samsung, naturally, hasn't commented on the leak, but given the recent issues surrounding the fingerprint scanners on its Galaxy devices, a shift to face recognition would certainly make sense for the company.
30/10/10: We're likely still months away from the official unveiling of the Galaxy S11, but the first rumours are starting to crop up.
Following the leak that it'll likely launch on 18 February (below), we're now hearing that the Galaxy S11 will be powered by Qualcomm and Samsung's as-yet-unannounced Snapdragon 865 and Exynos 9830 processors, respectively. 
This somewhat unsurprising information - though some rumours had pointed to Samsung's new Exynos 980 SoC powering the Galaxy S11 lineup - was uncovered in a OneUI 2.0 beta by XDA's Max Weinbach. 
The Snapdragon 865, which will likely be unveiled in December at Qualcomm's annual Tech Summit, will reportedly be based on the 7nm EUV-based fabrication process and leaked benchmarks peg it as an octa-core SoC with a base frequency of 1.8GHz.
Samsung's Exynos 9830 is unlikely to make its debut until next year, but we already know a bit about the chip; rumours claim it'll rely on four Cortex A55 cores for low-performance and four Cortex A77 cores for high-performance.  
Weinbach also found references to three models of the Galaxy S11, at least one of which supports 5G. The One UI beta also includes references to LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.0 storage support.
7/10/19: We don't yet know much about the Samsung Galaxy S11, but we might already know when it will be launching.
A source speaking to SamMobile has claimed that the next-gen Galaxy flagship will make its debut on 18 February, just days before next year's Mobile World Congress kicks off. 
While such a date would make sense - the Galaxy S10 landed on 20 February, and the Galaxy S9 before it on 25 February - even SamMobile is sceptical; it notes that it's "not confident enough in the source of this information to put our weight behind the date provided", so we'd take this early rumour with a hefty pinch of salt.
Beyond this shady leak, there's not much information surrounding the Galaxy S11 yet. There's some chatter that the smartphone will feature the bonkers 108MP camera sensor that Samsung showed off earlier this year, and SamMobile notes that it'll likely ship with One UI 2.1 and up to 1TB of internal storage. 
There's also a "very good chance" the Galaxy S10 will somewhat inevitably follow in the footsteps of the Note 10 and ditch the line-up's long-standing headphone jack in favour of USB-C.
If we were to put our speculative hat on, we'd also assume the Galaxy S11 will pack Qualcomm's next-generation Snapdragon 865 SoC, 5G support, a punch-hole display with baked-in fingerprint scanner and triple rear-mounted camera setup. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey alone on Palestine but will keep supporting oppressed, Erdoğan says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Turkey generally feels alone regarding the situation in Jerusalem and Palestine, but will not stop defending the cause, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowed Monday.
"The situation in Palestine and Jerusalem is deteriorating and some Arab countries are encouraging Israeli violations. I feel like Turkey is alone on this, but we will continue to stand with the oppressed," Erdoğan told a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul.Recalling that the Jerusalem case laid the foundation of the OIC, Erdogan said that the situation in Jerusalem and Palestine is getting worse every day.He noted that Israel's attitude, which does not recognize rights, law, justice and humanity, constantly deepens the crisis in the region against Muslims."We are aware that one of the reasons behind the terrorist attacks and economic sabotages we have been subjected to in recent years is our principled stance," he said, adding that Turkey will continue to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and never stop defending the rights of the Palestinians.Israel occupied east Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. In 1980, in a move never recognized by the international community, Israel annexed the entire city, claiming it as the self-proclaimed Jewish state's "eternal and undivided" capital.Erdoğan also underlined that the imperialist approach of divide, disintegrate and rule continues in Islamic countries saying: "Muslims, who make up about one-fourth of the world's population today, do not have, unfortunately, the political influence or the economic, social or cultural prowess.”
"The better we protect children, women, elderly and disabled against western threats, the more we protect our family structure," he said.The Turkish president added that "isolated" Islamic countries are wasting their opportunities and energies.
Erdoğan stressed that it was impossible to get somewhere by simply complaining or talking, arguing for the pressing need to think carefully, analyze and produce solutions to the causes of oppression felt by Muslims today.
"It is our responsibility, as Muslims, to take Islamic civilization to its rightful place," he said.
He noted that in 2018, Turkey was added to the "very high" development category for the first time, posting 0.806 value points on the human development index (HDI).Turkey ranked 59th out of 189 countries and territories, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said in a report released Monday.The HDI is a summary measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living.Erdoğan later spoke at the Eighth Ministerial Conference of Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process at Dolmabahçe Palace under the theme of "peace, partnership, prosperity."In his speech, Erdoğan called on the international community to boost the investments made for Afghanistan in the last 18 years as the country has been going through a sensitive period.His speech focused on "regional cooperation" to tackle problems the South Asia region has been facing."I believe that the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process is also very useful and effective in providing regional support for peace," he said.Erdoğan said while the international community was committed to its pledges to Afghanistan, it was important that the Afghan government fulfills its obligations.
"We welcome the positive steps taken by the Afghan government in the implementation of the Mutual Accountability Framework adopted in Geneva last year," Erdoğan said.He added that Turkey would do its best to eradicate the Daesh terrorist group's presence in Afghanistan.The Heart of the Asia-Istanbul Process – a regional initiative of Afghanistan and Turkey launched in 2011 – has two chairs, with Afghanistan as the permanent chair, as well as a co-chair from among member states shifting each year.
"The process aims to promote regional security, economic and political cooperation centered on Afghanistan through dialogue and confidence-building measures," according to the organization's website.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least two soldiers were killed and seven more injured in a PKK bomb explosion in southeastern Turkey on Monday.
According to the governorate, an improvised explosive device (IED) planted by PKK terrorists exploded during disposal efforts in southeastern Şırnak province.
Security forces launched an investigation into the deadly explosion.
In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU – has been responsible for the deaths of some 40,000 people, including women and children.
In addition to killing women and children in terror attacks, PKK ringleaders are known to sexually abuse and rape women and children who they trick into coming to their training camps.
International organizations, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, have also repeatedly documented the PKK and its Syrian affiliate, the People's Protection Units (YPG), kidnapping and forcing hundreds of children to fight in their ranks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Goldman Plans To Launch Robo Adviser Next Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Goldman Sachs is planning to launch digital wealth management services to customers with as little as $5,000 in 2020.
The company is also planning to launch a robo adviser next year, offering a solution for clients with as little as “$5,000, $10,000 or $15,000” to invest, Joe Duran, founder of the United Capital wealth management firm that Goldman acquired earlier this year, told The Financial Times. While the minimum investment hasn’t been finalized yet, it will be “significantly lower” than Goldman’s traditional accounts.
“It’s a pipeline for future clients,” said Duran, adding that the robo adviser would start out with clients “with low complexity, not that much in assets.”
He admitted that his company’s integration with Goldman was happening “a lot quicker than I would have guessed” and there is now a bigger opportunity than the original goal of doubling its $25 billion of assets under management within three years. He explained that United Capital has already carried out trials with clients found through Ayco, Goldman’s employee financial counselling service.
“We’ve already picked up millions of dollars of new clients from those relationships,” Duran said. “The demand is higher than I expected — corporate entities love having a local adviser who can meet with them face to face.” He added that referrals from Goldman’s private bank were a “much bigger growth area than originally envisioned.”
The robo adviser will be offered both to United Capital’s direct clients, as well as outside advisers who use United Capital’s FinLife wealth management platform.
“We have a lot of clients who have kids and are in relationships with people who don’t have their [level of] assets,” said Duran. He said the typical account size is expected to be higher than other robo advisers such as Betterment, which has no minimum investment amount, “because of the kind of people the [Goldman] brand attracts.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">State AGs To Fight T-Mobile-Sprint Merger In Federal Trial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A group of state attorneys general are getting set to fight against the T-Mobile and Sprint merger in an unprecedented federal trial.
Sprint and T-Mobile announced the $26 billion deal last year. The all-stock deal has T-Mobile exchanging 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share. T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company — which will be known as T-Mobile — and Sprint parent SoftBank Group will own 27 percent. The remaining 31 percent will be held by the public.
In October, the merger officially received enough votes to win approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). But now this case, which begins on Monday (December 9) and includes 13 states and the District of Columbia, all led by Democratic AGs, is seeking to block it, arguing that the merger of two companies offering steep discounts could make cell phone plans more expensive.
Legal experts say it is unprecedented for the states to attempt to block a merger of this size, and a victory for the AGs could give states newfound power regarding antitrust enforcement when it comes to tech companies.
If the states prevail, “companies will have to take them more seriously,” New York University law professor Harry First said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “They’ll have to have really serious discussions with states like California and New York.”
“If we have another four years of the Trump administration, we may see more of this,” he added.
Judge Victor Marrero will be overseeing the case in federal court in New York, with the trial expected to last about three weeks. Various executives will testify, including T-Mobile boss John Legere, Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure and Dish Network Corp. Chairman Charlie Ergen.
Last week a meeting to discuss an out-of-court settlement was canceled, but there is still the chance for both sides to reach a deal during the trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Met Office warns of power cuts when high winds hit Derbyshire</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for heavy winds in Derbyshire, meaning power cuts are possible.
People across the county have been told to expect delays to road, rail and air transport are likely as a result of winds that may reach up to 60mph.
Bus and train services are expected to be affected, with some journeys taking longer and being made worse by spray and surface water.
High sided vehicles like buses and lorries may have issues travelling on exposed routes and bridges.
The warning is in place until lunchtime today, Monday, December 9.
Met Office officials have also said "short term loss of power and other services is possible".
They say on their website: "Gusts of wind can unsettle vehicles, grip your steering wheel firmly with both hands. This is particularly important when planning to overtake.
"Keep an eye out for gaps between trees, buildings or bridges over a river or railway, these are some of the places you are more likely to be exposed to side winds.
"Ensure that you maintain enough room either side of your vehicle so you can account for it being blown sideways."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'No great panic' says Clough after Pirelli disappointment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Burton Albion’s 2-0 home defeat against Lincoln City led to inevitable grumbling from some supporters but manager Nigel Clough remains convinced that the Brewers are on course in their League One season.
An early goal by Harry Anderson, the second header conceded from a corner in a week, and a late one from Tyler Walker condemned Albion to a third home defeat of the season and they are 15th in the table today.
The Brewers’ sixth game in 19 days appeared to be one too far against a Lincoln side who had played only one in the same period but Clough maintains his players’ efforts bodes well.
“Lincoln did play well and, once we’d given them a goal after only two minutes, it ultimately decided the game,” said Clough.
“We gave away a goal very similar to the one the other night (Tuesday against Southend) and then we were chasing the game at home for long periods of time.
“The goal lifted Lincoln and they threw their bodies on the line in front of stuff and blocked shots but, apart from at set-plays, I didn’t think they bothered us too much.
“One thing I am not disappointed about is the effort of the players. It was absolutely incredible on the back of what we’ve had in the last 10 days or two weeks. They gave absolutely every ounce of everything they had and that’s the bottom line, that’s what we ask for more than anything.
“There’s no great panic. As long as we see the sort of effort we saw, and the quality, at times, we’ll back the players all day.”
Asked the extent to which tiredness had played a part, Clough said: “It’s a little factor but I didn’t think we looked that tired. I thought we played well.
“When you are tired, you can’t get the ball or keep the ball. I thought we kept the ball well and Stephen Quinn was again head and shoulders above anyone else on the pitch. We huffed and puffed but what we didn’t have was that individual piece of skill just to unlock their defence and get us a goal.
“Scott Fraser gave us that on Tuesday night with a wonderful free kick but no-one could do that this time. In the final third, there were wasted crosses and things like that. We could have had a shout for a penalty. Scott thought he got caught but it would have been a difficult one for the referee to give. It wasn’t clear-cut.”
Injuries stretched Burton again, with John Brayford, Oliver Sarkic and Reece Hutchinson missing from the match-day squad, while John-Joe O’Toole started a four-match suspension after his second red card of the season on Tuesday against Southend United.
Albion also lost Nathan Broadhead after half-an-hour. The on-loan Everton youngster returned from a month out but pulled up and had to be replaced by David Templeton.
“Nathan’s hamstring was tight again,” said Clough. “He had trained all week, with (physio) Nick Fenton initially, then he joined in with a full session and he thought he was fully fit but it has tightened up again. It’s a big blow for us because, after those first two minutes, he and Liam Boyce were causing them problems. I thought we were looking good at that point.”
At least, this time, Clough did not end the game bemoaning a refereeing performance, as Blackburn official Ben Toner controlled the game without controversy.
“Having talked about the referee the other night, I thought the referee today was excellent,” added Clough. “There was one booking, for Ryan Edwards, that was a bit inconsistent but other than that he was excellent.”
Daniel in the spotlight...
Burton Albion left-back Colin Daniel found himself in the spotlight again for all the wrong reasons after the Brewers’ 2-0 defeat at home to Lincoln City.
Praised in midweek by manager Nigel Clough for his efforts in two games since returning to the starting line-up, Daniel (pictured) had nonetheless been singled out as the defender who lost his man at a corner for Southend United’s goal on Tuesday night. Against Lincoln, Clough was annoyed that Daniel gave the ball away cheaply within seconds of the start, which led to two corners, with Lincoln scoring from the second.
“It wasn’t the corner so much, as we knew they would be a threat at those, as the way we gave the ball away five seconds after the kick-off,” said Clough.
“That was Colin Daniel, who had the ball at his feet and basically didn’t do what he’d been asked to do. Colin has come back into the team and has played, generally, OK but he has cost us two vitally important goals in two games. Sometimes, we might have to sacrifice a little bit of what he gives us going forward because he’s a defender and his job is not to give goals away.
“He put one magnificent ball across the face of the goal, which Lucas Akins got a toe on and so nearly finished, and we remember the ball he put in last week at Oldham for Liam Boyce to tap in, which won us the game. So it’s there, it just has to come more consistently.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brewers need a breather after fresh Imps run off with the points</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best thing that can be said about Burton Albion’s 2-0 defeat at home to Lincoln City is that there is a lot of the League One season left.
That is, a lot of time to forget this game and this week, one in which the Brewers targeted six points from a long-awaited return to League One action at the Pirelli Stadium and finished up with one.
In some respects, Saturday’s result was an accident waiting to happen. Patched up even more than usual because of injuries, Burton were playing their sixth match in 19 days against a Lincoln side who had played one match in the same period, the best part of three weeks ago.
Were the Imps absolutely bursting to get back into action? You bet they were and they delivered a performance full of determination, organisation and swift, sharp passing.
Frankly, it was like watching one of the Brewers’ better away performances. They pressed relentlessly without the ball, threw themselves in the way of crosses and shots and they broke forward decisively and inventively.
The doom-mongers, waiting to pounce, who saw this as a terrible Burton performance are way off the mark, their eyes clouded by the second disappointing result of the week. There was plenty of endeavour about Albion and a good few chances created. But this was a tired performance and the first week without a midweek game for a while will be welcome.
Stats can turn around quickly, too. The Brewers went into this one with one defeat in seven League games. The alternative sequence now is one win in six but it has certainly been no help that they have been so strung out, with half of the last 10 games having been in cup competitions. That, at least, will start to ease.
The extent to which Burton, missing John Brayford, Oliver Sarkic, Reece Hutchinson and John-Joe O’Toole, were stretched was emphasised by a bench featuring two goalkeepers - an odd move - two others learning their trade and the fitness coach. The only two used, Joe Sbarra and David Templeton, were the only two likely to be.
With all of those circumstances in place, the last thing the Brewers needed to do was concede an early goal but they did, to a second free header from a corner in a week.
Colin Daniel, who endured a difficult afternoon, gave the ball away as Lincoln won an immediate corner, then a second, and Harry Anderson ran across the area to glance in a header from it. The goal gave Lincoln a lift and something to hang on to.
It took Burton 10 minutes or so to get any kind of passing going, a spell during which former loanee Jake Hesketh was booked for diving as he avoided a Jake Buxton challenge.
Liam Boyce, running from 40 yards out, drove a shot wide from just outside the box but there was little for a travelling contingent from his old club in Northern Ireland, Cliftonville, to cheer.
Albion were buzzing around keenly but misplacing too many passes and Ryan Edwards sent a shot wildly out of the ground before being booked for delaying a throw-in, a cheap yellow card which now brings him a suspension.
One promising break found Boyce offside when Scott Fraser played him in and when he was next clear, and onside, his shot was turned away by Lincoln keeper Josh Vickers.
Nathan Broadhead had started but the Everton loanee limped off with a tight hamstring after 33 minutes.
Before half-time, Fraser jinked into a yard of space and pulled a shot wide from 20 yards, while Buxton was foiled by an offside flag as he got a foot to a free kick from the left and sent it goalwards.
Lincoln began the second half with a flurry of corners but soon the Brewers were pressing again and Templeton, nicking the ball from a defender, had a shot pushed away by Vickers.
Daniel’s most effective ball in from the left of the game was poked wide by Lucas Akins at the near post, an awkward chance, but the Imps had the bit between their teeth and began threatening on the counter, with the scorer, Andrews, looking particularly dangerous on the right wing.
As time began to run out, there was a shout for a penalty as Fraser went to ground in a scramble in the box but it did not look conclusive.
Burton’s frustration was summed up early in stoppage time by Stephen Quinn. The Irishman had again been their stand-out player but he scythed Anderson down on the right touchline and the free kick led to Jorge Grant hitting a shot against the bar.
Lincoln confirmed the win their efforts had deserved in the last minute of stoppage time when Anderson broke again down the right and pulled the ball back for former Burton loanee Tyler Walker to turn in.
The Brewers need a breather. This week, they have one - and then it is a trip to leaders Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.

A colourful parade headed by no other than Father Christmas winding its way through the city centre and the fun-filled musical extravaganza which culminated in the big moment when the Market Place and surrounding streets were flooded with a sparkling lights display.
There have been many different versions of the event over the years but one thing has never changed, the excitement of the crowds who have packed into the square to witness the spectacle.
These fabulous photos from our archive show some of the switch-on events in the Noughties and the celebrities who have done the honours, including everyone from entertainer Lionel Blair and Coronation Street and Benidorm actress Sherrie Hewson to X-Factor finalists and Britain’s Got Talent winner George Sampson.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CLEARWATER, Fla. — Some kids in Pinellas County are hoping to inspire other kids their age.
The Clearwater High School Civil Rights Ambassadors are visiting other Pinellas County high schools inviting other students to participate in an upcoming unity walk.
The students gave a short civil rights lesson to other students and invited them to participate.
They're spreading a message of history, hope and inclusion.
PINELLAS NEWS | The latest headlines from Pinellas County
"After what has happened in this nation and in this school district, are we unified? So, we decided to put together this unity walk to unify all of us because at the end of the day we are a district united," says Kayla Bredeson.
This is the first year Pinellas County Schools will participate in the Unity Walk.
The Unity Walk will be on January 28, 2020. Their goal will be for 30 students from each school to attend.
Lynda Blackmon Lowery will be the guest speaker. She's the youngest person who walked across the Edmond Pettis Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. She was 14 years old.
The Civil Rights Ambassador program is a class at Clearwater High School. The students research and participate in experiences that connect them to the impact of the Civil Rights Movement. They also volunteer in various programs to make a positive impact in the community.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ford is recalling nearly 262,000 heavy-duty pickup trucks in the U.S. and Canada because the tailgates can open unexpectedly.
The recall covers F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks from the 2017 through 2019 model years. All the trucks have electric tailgate latch release switches in the tailgate handle.
Ford says water can get into the electrical wiring and cause a short circuit, activating the switches and releasing the latches.
The company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries.
Trucks with mechanical tailgate latches are not affected. Dealers will fix the tailgate frame wiring harnesses and install a new tailgate handle release switch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel Auto Call Screening, Memory Management Updates Coming With New 'Feature Drop'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Pixel 4 family is famous for its strong support from Google. Google tends to support the devices with three years of major Android OS, along with feature/security updates, which is much better than we typically expect from other Android OEMs. Google is now introducing a new category of updates for its Pixel devices, and it is calling it a "feature drop".
Google says that feature drops bring bigger and more impactful updates than the typical security updates and bug fixes, and will come "on a regular basis." The first feature drop is coming later this month and includes a handful of new features for Pixel users.
One of the most prominent additions is the ability for the Google Assistant to automatically screen calls. The feature should help to make your life a bit more manageable as it will not only detect robocalls, but it will also screen unknown callers before your phone even rings. If the Google Assistant determines that the call is actually important, Google says that "your phone rings a few moments later with helpful context" about the caller.
Other new features that will be arriving this month include the ability to apply portrait "blur" to an image post-capture, and auto-framing for Duo video calls. The latter update will automatically keep your face centered thanks to the use of the Pixel 4's wide-angle selfie camera. Portrait-style effects can be applied for Duo calls to blur out your background (especially helpful if your room or office is a disaster) and is applicable to the Pixel 2, Pixel 3 and Pixel 4.
Rounding out the bevy of new functionality are improvements to memory management, which will be especially welcome to Pixel 3 and Pixel 2 owners. According to Google, "Your phone proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more."
Google says that the first feature drop is already in the process of being pushed out to Pixel owners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Could This Be The OnePlus 8 Lite Phone On Deck For A 2020 Launch?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There might not be all that many surprises from OnePlus in 2020, at least in regards to its OnePlus 8 series of smartphones. We have already seen leaked renders of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro over the past few months. Now we can add a OnePlus 8 Lite model to the mix, with a fresh set of renders showing off the device.In case you missed any of the past leaks, the OnePlus 8 will supposedly launch with a curved-edge display sporting a punch-hole design, and three cameras on the rear on the device. The OnePlus 8 Pro, meanwhile, sports a similar design with the same curved-edge display and punch-hole design for the front camera, but with a quad-camera arrangement on the back.Both of those are going to be high-end handsets that occupy the flagship space. The OnePlus 8 Lite, however, is poised to be a mid-range phone with a design that is more in line with Samsung's Galaxy S11, Note 10 Lite, and Galaxy A91.
As has been a recurring collaboration, notorious leaker @OnLeaks joined forces with 91mobiles to post a handful of renders showcasing the OnePlus 8 Lite. Unlike the other two phones in the OnePlus 8 series, the OnePlus 8 Lite touts a flat-display design, which is estimated to be between 6.4 and 6.5 inches. It also sports a punch-hole cutout for the front camera, positioned in the center at the top of the handset.We can also make out some other details, such as a Type-C port on the bottom and an alert slider on the side. Missing, however, is a 3.5mm headphone jack.On the back, there is a curved glass panel with a reflective finish. We also see a rectangular housing of the rear cameras—there appear to be two camera lenses, along with an LED flash and some other sensors (possibly a Time of Flight sensor being among them).OnLeaks says the phone measures around 159.2 x 74 8.6mm. Beyond that, there are no other concrete details, such as which processor will be inside, what the specs of the cameras are, and whether or not it will feature a 90Hz refresh rate display like the other two OnePlus 8 models.Images Source: 91mobiles (via OnLeaks)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The whitest boy on the beach, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, has decided to bring his beach-grabbing exploits to the attention of everyone.
Of course, that's not what Huckabee actually wanted to do. He wanted his privatizing of the area where water meets land to remain as unnoticed as he wishes his front yard was. But if we've learned anything at all over the years, it's that the more you try to stop people from talking about your beachfront property, the less likely it is that you'll get them to stop talking about it.
Huckabee's $6 million mansion in the Florida panhandle proves money can't buy quite as much happiness as it used to. Huckabee thought he had purchased a chunk of beach to go with his beach house. Florida beachgoers felt otherwise. They used "his" beach like they used the beach anywhere else along the coast.
Andy Marlette of the Pensacola News Journal has compiled a few choice quotes from Huckabee regarding the disrespecting of his $6 million beachfront property.
Fun stuff. Huckabee says he bought the beach along with the house. Governor Rick Scott agreed, passing a law that privatized a bunch of previously-public land in 2018. (It was sort of walked back a few months later.)  A bunch of Floridians disagree and have been working to codify public access to beaches panhandle millionaires believe they own. Attorney Daniel Uhlfelder has been leading the charge, doing pro bono work for non-profit "Florida Beaches for All."
Uhlfelder has also been taking a few Twitter jabs at Mike Huckabee, much to the former governor's dismay. Here's Steve Bousquet's summation of recent events, which have culminated in a very stupid move by the $6 million man.
Yes, Huckabee has filed a bar complaint in hopes of shutting down this persistent critic -- one who suggested Huckabee's Secret Service nickname should be "beach thief." The complaint [PDF] is quite the read, with Huckabee (through legal representation) explaining just how awful (and allegedly unethical) it is to be mocked on social media.
Whew. OK then. The complaint contains numerous screenshots from Uhlfelder's Twitter account doing things like calling Huckabee out for blocking him. It also contains tweets noting that Huckabee has called Uhlfelder an "ambulance chaser" and suggested the lawyer "follow Jesus" rather than Huckabee. (On Twitter, I guess…)
What it doesn't show is anything Uhlfelder should be reprimanded for. Sure, Uhlfelder could be a bit more tactful when interacting with litigation opponents on social media, but the Florida Bar rules don't specifically prohibit this sort of behavior. Lawyers aren't allowed to "disparage" or "humiliate" opposing litigants, but it would be a stretch to call Uhlfelder's mostly-innocuous tweaking of the easily-offended Huckabee a violation of this rule.
What Huckabee has managed to do is draw more attention to both his own questionable actions and the movement targeting the law that turned public beaches into private yards last year. Uhlfelder had fewer than 500 Twitter followers prior to Huckabee's complaint. Now, he has over 70,000.
Huckabee tried to silence a critic by handing him a bigger megaphone. If Huckabee's skin had just been a little thicker, this could have been contained to the tiny part of Twitter that cares about the dynamics of Florida beachfront legislation. Instead, it's now all about Huckabee and his inability to handle criticism. Huckabee now has thousands of new critics, almost none of whom can be hit with a bar complaint.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Led by Kevin Abstract and formed partially through the online forum "KanyeToThe", Brockhampton is a self-described boy band, in an effort to redefine the term.
The European tour announcement follows the boyband's set at Tyler, The Creator's eightth annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival and caps off a year in which they released their fifth studio album GINGER.
The band is currently embarking on their biggest North American tour to date, including back-to-back sold-out shows in New York at Madison Square Garden's Hulu Theater alongside Slowthai and 100 gecs.
Formed in 2015, the group is best known for songs such as BOY BYE, NO HALO, VICTOR ROBERTS, IF YOU PRAY RIGHT and more.
The group consists of vocalists Kevin Abstract, Matt Champion, Merlyn Wood, and Dom McLennon, vocalists/producers Joba and Bearface, and producers Romil Hemnani, Jabari Manwa, and Kiko Merley, as well as graphic designer Henock 'HK' Sileshi, photographer Ashlan Grey, web designer Roberto Ontenient, and manager Jon Nunes.
Brockhampton play Birmingham's O2 Academy on May 22.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fleabag creator ‘totally obsessed’ by new film project</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge has revealed that a film she is collaborating on with her sister is the most exciting thing she has ever done.
The Fleabag creator revealed that her sister Isobel, a musician who wrote the score for the hit TV show, has a role in the secretive new project.
“I am totally obsessed,” Waller Bridge said. “I have never been so excited about writing anything.”
Her comments came at an event at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night to discuss her new book based on the hit TV show – Fleabag: The Scriptures.
It would not be Waller-Bridge’s first film credit. She was brought in to help polish off the script for the forthcoming Bond movie.
She also revealed a desire to write another play.
Fleabag was originally staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013 before being adapted for a BBC series three years later.
The second series introduced a character widely referred to as the “hot priest” by fans, who becomes a love interest for Fleabag – the show’s unnamed protagonist.
But Ms Waller-Bridge said she did not invent the term to refer to the character played by Andrew Scott.
“He is very much just ‘priest’ in the script – Twitter created ‘hot priest’, I believe,” she said.
But Waller-Bridge, who also stars as Fleabag, said she was nervous about writing the character.
“I was worried about writing a priest, especially a comedy priest,” she said, revealing that she was afraid of falling into some traps.
Published last month, Fleabag: The Scriptures contains the show’s script and new writing from Waller-Bridge.
The show started life as a 10-minute monologue at the Leicester Square Theatre in London, but was made into a full Edinburgh show after Waller-Bridge was accosted by a member of the audience afterwards.
The writer revealed that an “absolutely hammered” woman came up to her to demand she turn the short piece into a full-length play.
“That was so f****** good, you’ve got to take it to Edinburgh,” the woman said, according to Waller Bridge. “I was like ‘yeah, yeah’,” she said. “The next day Francesca (Moody, Fleabag’s producer) contacted the Underbelly.”

The New Zealand quintet has sold more than 10 million albums, and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2016.
The group disbanded in 1996, performing several farewell concerts in the same year. The group originally re-formed in 2006 and released two further albums, before once again disbanding in 2011.
Crowded House will play Arena Birmingham on June 18.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Darrell Clarke's challenge to Walsall strikers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forward Elijah Adebayo got the only goal of the game in the first minute of the second half.
A superb defensive display secured the three points but Clarke was unhappy with his team’s possession of the ball.
“We have to be better with our back to play, strikers look after the ball,” he said. “I can’t remember how many times we’ve given the ball away with our back to play.
“Just keep the ball, find the pass, make another movement. The basics of possession football.
“It’s something we have to look at and obviously improve on.
“Against Chelsea I thought for 70 minutes we were outstanding with the ball, moving it on the front foot.
“But it’s three points away from home which in this league is very hard to come by.
“We’ll take the positives, I know I’m just a miserable git but it’s just the way I am.”
Midfielder Stuart Sinclair returned to the side after missing eight games through an unspecified injury.
The experienced battler lasted the full 90 minutes at Vale Park and Clarke was pleased to have him back.
“It’s nice to have the beard running around isn’t it,” he added. “His heart and desire. It’s testament to the way he looks after himself to get 90 minutes.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The total number of confirmed victims of a massive fire that broke out in Odesa's Economics, Law and Hospitality College on December 4 has grown to 12.
"Another two bodies were found under the rubble as of 07:15 on Monday, December 9," says the Odesa Region Police Department.
"The bodies are yet to be identified. Four people are still missing," it said.
As UNIAN reported earlier, a fire broke out on the third floor of a six-story education block of Odesa's Economics, Law and Hospitality College on the morning of December 4. The area of the fire covered 4,000 square meters. The block housed 19 different organizations and establishments.
As of the morning of December 8, ten people, including a rescuer, were declared dead. Thirty people were injured, of them, nine are still in hospital.
Criminal proceedings were initiated under Part 2 of Article 270 (violation of fire safety rules) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The police are considering two theories: the use of malfunctioning electrical equipment and an arson attack.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says NATO does not consider Russia an "enemy".
"We don't list foes. So we don't define Russia as an enemy. What we see is a more assertive Russia, which has used military force against neighbor Ukraine," Stoltenberg told CNN.
At the same time, he emphasized that NATO would not turn a blind eye to Russian aggression and ensured that the Alliance would try to apply dialogue wherever it is possible.
"We don't divide the world into either foes or friends," said the NATO secretary general, when pressed to define Russia.
Stoltenberg added that in an "uncertain" moment like this, such a strong institute as NATO is required to ensure security of the West.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kentucky law requiring abortion seekers to listen to fetal heartbeat will stand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a challenge to a Kentucky law requiring doctors to describe ultrasound images and play fetal heartbeat sound to abortion seekers.
Kentucky argued the law is "simple and straightforward," calling it part of an" informed-consent process." The law, Kentucky said, "does nothing more than require that women who are considering an abortion be provided with information that is truthful, non-misleading and relevant to their decision of whether to have an abortion."
The court rejected the case without comment or noted dissent by any of the justices.
Challengers, including an abortion clinic, argued that the law forced patients to see the images even if she didn't want to, and that it violated doctors' First Amendment rights.
The law had been upheld by the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, but that ruling was on hold pending the Supreme Court appeal.
"As a First Amendment matter, there is nothing suspect with a State's requiring a doctor, before performing an abortion, to make truthful, non-misleading factual disclosures, relevant to informed consent, even if those disclosures relate to unborn life and have the effect of persuading the patient not to have an abortion," the appeals court held in its ruling.
Civil rights groups blasted the court's decision not to take up the challenge.
"By refusing to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, the Supreme Court has rubber-stamped extreme political interference in the doctor-patient relationship," said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. "This law is not only unconstitutional, but as leading medical experts and ethicists explained, deeply unethical."
The Kentucky denial comes as the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion in the US is facing multiple challenges in lower courts.
"Although this case is abortion-related, the plaintiffs' challenge was that the law violated the free speech rights of the doctors, as opposed to the abortion rights of the patients," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
"In that regard, although many find the Kentucky law offensive, it doesn't implicate the same fundamental questions about the continuing scope of the right to choose that the justices identified in Roe as other cases already on the court's docket this term and coming down the pipeline," Vladeck added.
Later this term, the justices are set to consider a separate Louisiana law that requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges from a nearby hospital. The justices in 2016 struck down a similar law from Texas, which had led to clinic closures. The court majority said the law put an unconstitutional burden on women seeking abortion.
It will be the first abortion case that will be argued since Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch joined the bench, solidifying a conservative majority.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2 4-year-olds escape deadly crash by unhooking seats, climbing to safety</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WHIDBEY ISLAND, Wash. – Two young girls are alive after they managed to unhook themselves from their booster seats and climb to safety to escape an accident on Whidbey Island, according to the Washington State Patrol.
The girls, both 4 years old, were riding with Corey Simmons, 47, when the vehicle crashed into some trees in a wooded area about 200 feet away from the road, said Trooper Heather Axtman, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Patrol.
The accident happened around 6 p.m. Friday just outside of Clinton, Washington, about an hour from Seattle.
According to Axtman, Simmons was not wearing a seat belt and was likely killed on impact. The girls, who were riding in the back of the car when the accident happened, were able to release themselves from their booster seats, crawl out of the car and find their way through a wooded area and up a small embankment to the side of the road, Axtman said.
A woman driving by noticed the girls standing on the side of the road and stopped to help them. Describing the area as very rural, Axtman said the chances that anyone would drive by and see these girls "was truly the right time at the right place" type of thing.
The Good Samaritan put the girls in her car to keep them warm and called 911.
Police and fire responded to the scene, where Simmons was pronounced dead. The 4-year-olds were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries where they were reunited with their family, Axtman said.
"The bravery that these two little girls showed was incredible," she said. Highlighting how they were so young, but were able to find their way from the crash in the cold and dark, Axtman called them "extremely heroic and brave."
Authorities are not releasing the names of the girls involved because they are minors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juice WRLD: Rapper dies following medical emergency at Chicago airport</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rapper and singer Juice WRLD has died in Chicago, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said Sunday.
Juice, who was born Jarad Anthony Higgins, turned 21 on December 2.
The rapper suffered a medical emergency shortly after arriving at Chicago's Midway International Airport, according to people who were traveling with him, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email to CNN. The rapper died shortly after at a nearby hospital, according to police.
"There were no signs of foul play and all individuals aboard the aircraft are cooperating with CPD and have given all of their information," Guglielmi said.
Police are waiting for the medical examiner to determine cause and manner of death, he said.
An autopsy hasn't been performed and no cause of death has been determined, Cook County Medical Examiner's Office spokeswoman Natalia Derevyanny said.
"Juice made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time," the artist's label, Interscope Records, said in a statement . "He was a gentle soul, whose creativity knew no bounds, an exceptional human being and artist who loved and cared for his fans above everything else."
Juice was signed to Interscope Records in March 2018 after scoring hits on SoundCloud with "Lucid Dreams" and "All Girls Are the Same," according to Billboard magazine , which profiled the artist in March.
SoundCloud says Juice was the most streamed, liked, and reposted artist on its platform in 2018 and "Lucid Dreams" notched the most plays of any song last year.
Juice WRLD was named Top New Artist at the Billboard Music Awards in May.
Billboard said his songs reached its Hot 100 chart 25 times in less than two years. Juice was included on three songs on the Hot 100 ranking as of Saturday, Billboard said, including two as lead artist.
Music world stunned by the sudden death
Several of Juice's fellow artists reacted to the news of his death on social media, including Drake.
"I would like to see all the younger talent live longer," he wrote on Instagram, "and I hate waking up hearing another story filled with blessings was cut short."
Fellow artist Lil Yachty, who featured Juice on his song "Yacht Club," expressed his shock on Twitter. "Wow, I can not believe this. Rip my brother juice world," he wrote.
Singer Ellie Goulding collaborated with Juice on the song "Hate Me" earlier this year. She shared photos of them together and said he was a "sweet soul."
"You had so much further to go, you were just getting started. You'll be missed Juice," she wrote.
Chart topper Lil Nas X paid tribute on Twitter, saying it's "so sad how often this is happening" to up-and-coming artists.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FBI now treating investigation into Pensacola naval station shooting as an 'act of terror'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The motive behind a 21-year-old gunman's attack on Naval Air Station Pensacola remains undetermined, but the FBI is treating it as "an act of terror," a member of the agency said.
Working under the "presumption that this was an act of terrorism" will allow agents to take advantage of certain investigative techniques, FBI Special Agent in Charge Rachel Rojas said.
Mohammed Alshamrani, a Saudi Arabian Air Force officer who had been in flight training at the base for two years, opened fire in a classroom building on Friday, killing three sailors who ran toward danger to protect others, officials said. Several others were injured.
The shooter used a handgun and was killed after two deputies exchanged gunfire with him.
The deadlyshooting "appears to be a terrorist attack," White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said. Authorities haven't found ties between the attacker and terrorist groups.
"We don't know yet if he was acting alone," O'Brien said on CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday. "The FBI is investigating, and they've been interviewing, interrogating other Saudi students."
The victims were Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida; Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia; and Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, from Enterprise, Alabama.
"If not for their actions, and the actions of the Naval Security Force that were the first responders on the scene, this incident could have been far worse," said Capt. Tim Kinsella, the commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola.
Several other Saudi nationals were questioned
Alshamrani was stationed at the base as part of an ongoing US military program training members of foreign militaries, including Saudi Arabia's.
US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Department of Defense will look at the measures currently in place to insure proper vetting and screening of foreign students. Still, he said, the shooting likely wouldn't impact the US-Saudi alliance.
"I don't see this undermining the deeper relationship we've had with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for decades," he said.
Over the weekend, several Saudi nationals were detained for questioning in connection to the attack, a US official told CNN. The officialdidn't provide information on their connection to the gunman.
Alshamrani and a small group of Saudi nationals traveled to New York City over the Thanksgiving holiday, a law enforcement official told CNN. They visited several museums and Rockefeller Center, the source said, but authorities don't know why they traveled to the city. The Saudis who accompanied Alshamrani are currently being interviewed by law enforcement and are being cooperative, the source added.
At least one Saudi national also filmed the shooting, Esper said.
On Sunday, the FBI said it was reviewing surveillance videos and a video taken by a bystander after the attack. A senior law enforcement official told CNN that one Saudi national who recorded the aftermath was considered a bystander, adding investigators didn't believe this person was involved in the attack and was far away from the scene when he captured the emergency response after the incident.
Friends of the gunman were detained after the killing, one or two of which recorded the attack, Esper said. It was unclear when they began filming, Esper told "Fox News Sunday."
A separate law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation says there is currently no indication of anything nefarious regarding any individual who recorded the attack scene.
The official says all witnesses to the incident are being interviewed.
Twitter account may have been linked to shooter
Minutes before authorities were alerted to the attack, a Twitter account aligning with the shooter's name posted a message that raises the possibility the attack was inspired by al Qaeda and its founder, Osama bin Laden, CNN's Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank wrote.
The message, addressed to the American people, declared hate for Americans because of their "crimes" against Muslims. It made no reference to an impending attack. Instead, it repurposed words used by bin Laden and the American al Qaeda terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.
CNN has been unable to verify the source of the tweet which was previously reported on by SITE Intelligence Group. Law enforcement has not commented on it.
A Twitter spokeswoman says the account was suspended, adding "That's all we have to share."
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantissaid in a Sunday news conference the shooter had "a major social media trail."
"This guy was somebody who had just a deep-seeded hatred for the United States and that was pretty clear from that," he said.
"For us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions to protect the country."
Foreign students from "partner nations" have trained at the base for years, Kinsella said.
The shooter was vetted before his entry into the pilot training program and after the shooting with nothing of concern found, a law enforcement source told CNN. But DeSantis said Sunday the shooting could have been prevented if there was "better vetting."
He bought his weapon using a hunting license
The shooter had bought the gun he used in the attack legally, two law enforcement officials told CNN.
One source said Alshamrani purchased the weapon from a gun store earlier this year using a hunting license, which allows a non-immigrant on a non-immigrant visa to purchase a gun.
Alshamrani used a Glock 9 mm pistol he bought "legally and lawfully," Rojas told reporters.
Alshamrani's uncle said his nephew had done "nothing suspicious" before moving to the US.
Saad bin Hantim Alshamrani said his nephew was "likable and mannered towards his family and the community." Alshamrani said he "has his religion, his prayer, his honesty and commitments" and that he was a "likable kid, smart, he was exceptionally smart."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- Police have issued a Citizen Commendable Action Coin to a Cape Coral man who helped rescue an elderly woman from a canal last month.
According to Cape Coral Police, on November 27th, Jeffrey Jennings saw an unknown elderly woman in the waters of the canal behind his home. He called 911 to summon police and medical personnel, then rode his bicycle to the home she appeared to be near on the opposite canal bank.
Jennings guided officers to the correct location, then jumped into the water to get the woman to safety.
The woman was assessed by medical staff and determined to be suffering from confusion and the early stages of hypothermia. Thanks to the actions of Jennings, she did not suffer any lasting effects.
Officers Ken Cody and William Dotson recommended Jennings be issued the Citizen Commendable Action Coin for his actions and assistance in helping the woman, and presented him with the award on December 2nd.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Zealand volcano erupts: 5 dead, many missing after eruption on White Island, officials say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WHITE ISLAND, New Zealand - At least five people are dead after a volcano erupted Monday on New Zealand’s White Island, officials said.
According to New Zealand police, 50 or fewer people, including more than 30 passengers on Royal Caribbean International’s Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, were in the area when the volcano erupted just after 2 p.m. local time Monday, CNN reported. Of the 23 people evacuated, five have died, and many of the 18 survivors were being treated for burn wounds, The Associated Press reported.
In a Monday night news conference, New Zealand police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said he was not sure how many people remain on the island but estimated that it was a double-digit number, the AP reported. Rescuers are not yet able to search the island because “the physical environment is unsafe,” Tims said.
Police have not released the nationalities or identities of the victims and the missing; however, the Guardian reported that at least 20 are Australian. Officials also believe that “overseas tourists” and New Zealand residents were affected, according to the AP.
Royal Caribbean issued a statement saying it is “devastated” by the eruption and offering sympathy to “those affected by this tragedy,” CNN reported.
“We are working together with local authorities, and we are providing all the help and care we can to our guests and their families, including offering medical resources and counseling,” the statement read. “We are also sending staff members from both our ship and our Sydney and Auckland offices to assist family members however possible.”
The cruise line added that the “Ovation of the Seas will remain in port as long as needed to assist with the situation,” according to CNN.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Top Irish Christmas traditions that make the season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here are just a few of Ireland’s favorite things at Christmas – some old, some new, but all activities and aspects that make Christmas in Ireland particularly special.  
In Ireland, Christmas lasts for about two weeks and is joyfully celebrated as a respite from the winter. Christmas really brings out the best in Ireland and the Irish, from cheerful festivities to wild acts of machismo, happy reunions, musical celebrations in church, and partying for weeks. These are the top Irish Christmas traditions. 
If you’re looking for a Church packed to the rafters, look no further than any church in Ireland at midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. This is a huge social gathering where family, friends, and neighbors who you may not have seen all year come together and celebrate Christmas.
With Christmas carols being sung and, often, live music being played, midnight Mass in Ireland is a great place to catch up with old friends and get in touch with the local community at Christmas.
St. Stephen is the patron saint of horses, but I am almost positive that this is not the reason that horse races on St. Stephen’s Day have become a tradition in Ireland. The races in Leopardstown in south Dublin, attract almost 20,000 people every year, but I think this has little to do with the old Germanic tradition of racing horses on St. Stephen’s Day to honor the saint.
In Ireland, heading off to the races is a chance to get out of the house, stretch your legs, perhaps have a flutter on the horses and have a drink with friends.
Christmas day swims take place all over Ireland on Christmas morning, but probably most famously at the Forty Foot Rock, just south of Dublin. On Christmas Day, hundreds of people can be seen jumping off the rock into the Irish Sea wearing only their bathing suits.
The water in the Irish Sea on Christmas Day is usually around 50F / 10C. Unfortunately, the temperature outside the water is usually far below that, making the experience bracing, to say the least. This is certainly not for the faint of heart but is a proven hangover cure, and participants often receive sponsorship for charities.
"The Dead" is a short story from James Joyce’s collection "Dubliners." A group of Dubliners gathers together for a post-Christmas celebration in James Joyce's transcendent tale of the banality and magic in life and death.
This tale has rather become like an Irish version of "The Christmas Carol," a tale of reflection on our past, our present, and our future.
This started off with aunties, grandmothers and relatives handing over hideous sweaters as presents for Christmas, but somehow Christmas sweaters have turned into a competition on the streets of Ireland. The woolier, hairier, and more ridiculously decorated the better. In fact, this year I spotted a gentleman with fake robins, bells and fairy lights all on one sweater.
During penal times, a group of soldiers was about to be ambushed. They had been surrounded, but a group of wrens pecked on their drums and woke them. The wren became known as “The Devil’s Bird.” To remember this, on St. Stephen’s Day people have a procession and go door-to-door wearing old clothes, blackened faces, and carrying a dead (now more often fake) wren on top of the pole. Then, crowds of "strawboys" dressed in straw suits and masks march to celebrate the wren.
This later evolved into a caroling event. Although people no longer go door-to-door, or at least very rarely, carolers can be heard on many main streets over Christmas raising money for charity. It there’s one thing the Irish love doing is making music and Christmas is the perfect excuse to make some noise.
Recently, I saw an Irish comic speak about USA biscuits for five minutes straight. It was only then that I realized that everyone I knew had a tin of biscuits in the house over Christmas when I was growing up.
Although there were the traditional mince pieces, pudding, and chocolates too, the biscuits and the rules about the tin are something that everyone I’ve spoken to remember. There were about ten types of biscuits in each layer of the tin but you were not allowed to break through to the second layer without finishing the first layer. This would cause at least one fight a day among the family. The tins were also filled with old-fashioned biscuits like pink wafers and bourbon creams.
Christmas decorations in Ireland traditionally were just a wreath of holly on the front door of the house. However, National Lampoon’s “Christmas Vacation” seems to have been a blueprint for many Irish households as they are now lit up like Rockefeller Center.
Also traditionally, decorations would go up on December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and come down on Little Christmas, January 6. However, this year I spotted full Christmas decorations on some houses in the first week of November. What can we say? The Irish love Christmas.
Most stores are closed Christmas and Stephen’s Day, but a brand new tradition sees more and more stores now opening after Christmas Day for exchanges and tempting deals.
January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, is traditionally when the Irish finish celebrating Christmas. It is also known as Nollaig na mBan in Irish (Women’s Christmas).
Tradition has it that women get the day off and the men of the house get to do the housework, cooking and take down the Christmas decorations. Women meet up, have a day out and treat themselves.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Poll: Likud, Blue & White up - Yisrael Beytenu down</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Blue and White and the Likud would both gain seats if new elections were held today, a new poll shows.
According to a survey conducted by Kantar and released by Kan Monday morning, if new elections were held today, Blue and White and the Likud would each gain two seats, rising from 33 for the center-left Blue and White to 35, while the Likud would rise from 32 to 34 seats.
The left-wing and right-wing blocs would also remain largely unchanged, with the left-Arab bloc holding steady at 57 seats, while the right-wing – religious bloc would rise from its current 55 seats to 56 seats. The secular rightist Yisrael Beytenu, which broke away from the right-wing bloc to demand a national unity government, would receive seven seats, down from its current eight.
The two haredi parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, would receive eight seats each, a gain of one for UTJ, which currently has seven, and a loss of one for Shas, which won nine in the September election.
The New Right party of Defense Minister Naftali Bennett would double its current strength of three seats, winning six, while the Jewish Home – National Union would fail to cross the electoral threshold, leaving it out of the next Knesset. In September, the Jewish Home, National Union, and New Right ran jointly on the Yamina list, winning seven seats – three of which went to the New Right, with the other four divided evenly between the National Union and the Jewish Home.
On the Left, Labor-Gesher and the Democratic Union would each fall by one seat, down to five and four seats respectively.
The Joint Arab List would remain stable at 13 seats.
Voters remain nearly evenly divided on who they prefer as prime minister, with 41% favoring incumbent premier Binyamin Netanyahu, compared to 38% who prefer challenger Benny Gantz of Blue and White.
The poll was conducted Sunday by Kantar, and included responses from 556 participants.

Monday will see intermittent rainfall and thunderstorms, from the north to the northern Negev. In the Negev, there will be light local rainfall and the Judean Desert and Dead Sea areas may flood. There may also be flooding along the coastline and in the lowlands. Temperatures will be lower than seasonal average, and snow may fall on Mount Hermon.
Tuesday will see local rainfall from the north to the northern Negev. Temperatures will remain lower than seasonal average, and the rain will lessen throughout the day.
Wednesday will be partly cloudy, with a rise in temperatures. Harsh eastern winds will blow in the northern mountains.
Thursday will see intermittent rainfall and thunderstorms in northern Israel and along the coast. There will be a drop in temperatures and snow may fall on Mount Hermon.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thing on your phone you only ever open by accident may soon become a thing you occasionally open on purpose, should you be the owner or potential owner of an electric car. This is thanks to EV charge point specialist Zap-Map adding access to most of its database of chargers via the "OK Google" voice search, making it straightforward to find a charge location without getting done or publically shamed for looking at your phone while driving.
Zap-Map says Android-powered smartphone users are able to use hands-free voice commands to order their telephone to find the nearest EV charge point; and results may then be filtered by charge speed, location, station operator or driving distance, with your virtual assistant also filled in on if the charger is working or out of order for some reason, and suggesting on-route locations if you're already on a satnav mission.
Zap-Map's Ben Lane said: "We are providing a quick and simple way for EV drivers to find out information on charge points at home, on the move and, for the first time ever, hands-free when they most need it -- while driving." [Zap-Map]

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Though fans have a guess… or two.
Matt Reeves made Bat-waves yesterday when he posted a simple tweet. Only three words, and one gif. The words? “Oh… Hi, Peter…” Oh, and there was also a Bat emoji. That part is pretty important.
That’s right, it appears Sarsgaard is next in line to join the franklyincredible cast of The Batman, alongside Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, and Paul Dano. Only problem is, Reeves didn’t divulge what might be the most important detail: who he’s playing. Fans have a guess, though, based on rumours about the film and some hints posted online.
One such hint might come from the Instagram of Sarsgaard’s wife, former Bat-star herself Maggie Gyllenhaal, who, concurrent with the announcement, posted an image of Sarsgaard mid-shave. Which is to say, solidly halfway through it.

Yep, that, along with the weird second face in the Sarsgaard gif chosen by Reeves, and just general rumours that the film might be taking inspiration from The Long Halloween, a lot of fans are assuming that Sarsgaard is going to be playing Harvey Dent, Two-Face himself. Is this true? I have no idea. But I think it would be neat!
For more The Batman news, stay tuned to Gizmodo. The movie is scheduled to hit cinemas on 25th June 2021, with filming starting next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netflix Has Scrapped Its Free 30-Day Trials Because You're a Cheap Arsehole</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix is either making another seemingly anti-consumer move, or there's enough people playing silly buggers to warrant the decision.
The streaming service offers a free 30-day trial to give you a little taste of the goods and - hopefully - get you hooked into dropping that sweet subscription fee every month. But it seems those golden days are over, as the option appears to have disappeared from the website.
Trusted Reviews reports that the free trial is no longer available in the UK, and the only comment Netflix has made so far has been to MoneySavingExpert, saying that existing customers who have already started the trial won't be affected, but no one else is getting in.
The Netflix spokesperson also said that the platform was "looking at different marketing promotions in the UK to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience," but didn't elaborate on what that entails.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has previously demonstrated a fairly laid back approach to people finding ways to avoid paying the sub fees but getting the content anyway - like password sharing, saying it's "something you have to learn to live with."
He apparently did a 180 with the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) - of which Netflix is a member - announcing that it would be working to tackle unauthorised access to content citing “improper password sharing” as an example.
Maybe people were going a bit nuts with free trials on a plethora of email accounts to the point that it's become an issue. Or perhaps the streaming wars means finding more ways to wring cash out of everyone. We've contacted Netflix for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Old man' Trump is 'bluffing' says North Korea: KCNA</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">North Korea on Monday accused US President Trump of "bluffing" and called him "an old man bereft of patience" as Pyongyang ramps up pressure on Washington over stalled nuclear talks.
Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un engaged in mutual insults and threats of devastation in 2017, sending tensions soaring before a diplomatic rapprochement the following year.
Pyongyang has now set Washington an end-of-year deadline to offer it new concessions in deadlocked nuclear negotiations, and has said it will adopt an unspecified "new way" if nothing acceptable is forthcoming.
Denuclearisation negotiations have been at a standstill since a summit in Hanoi broke up in February.
Trump has indicated that the option of military action was still on the table while downplaying Pyongyang's actions, saying the North's leader would not want to "interfere" with the upcoming US presidential elections.
"I'd be surprised if North Korea acted hostiley," Trump said Saturday.
But Kim Yong Chol, who served as the North's counterpart to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until the collapse of the Hanoi meeting, condemned Trump's "odd words and expression", referring to him as a "heedless and erratic old man".
If Trump is not "astonished" by North Korea's response, "we will be irritated," Kim, now the chairman of the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.
"This naturally indicates that Trump is an old man bereft of patience," he said, adding: "From those words and expressions we can read how irritated he is now."
The official noted that the North Korean leader had not used "any irritating expression towards the US president as yet", but warned his "understanding" of Trump could change.
"He must understand that his own style bluffing and hypocrisy sound rather abnormal and unrealistic to us," Kim said. "We have nothing more to lose."
Late Monday another North Korean official, Ri Su Yong, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, warned Trump against using abusive language.
In another statement carried by KCNA, he said the US president should "think twice if he does not want to see bigger catastrophic consequences."
The North has raised tensions in recent months with a series of assertive statements and multiple weapons tests -- including a "very important test" at its key satellite launch site at the weekend -- as its negotiating deadline approaches.
Kim's New Year speech, a key political set-piece in the isolated country, is due on January 1.
North Korea has threatened to resume referring to Trump as a "dotard", Pyongyang's favoured nickname for the US president at the height of tensions in 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger skin, foetuses found in Indonesia poacher case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The skin of a critically endangered Sumatran tiger and four foetuses have been confiscated after the arrest of several suspected poachers, Indonesian police said.
The suspects may have been planning to sell the skin to a foreign collector, while its bones were earlier sold, possibly for use in medicinal products popular in some parts of Asia, authorities said.
It was not clear how the foetuses, which were kept in a jar, were to be used.
The evidence was presented by police at a press briefing Sunday after they announced three people had been arrested at the weekend.
"We suspect that they would sell the skin to collectors, not only in Indonesia," Edward Hutapea, wildlife enforcement chief in Pekanbaru on Sumatra island, told AFP on Monday.
The suspects had previously sold another tiger skin, but had yet to unload the second skin and foetuses, he said, adding that the unborn mammals were from the big cat sold earlier this year.
If convicted, the trio could face up to five years in prison.
Poaching is responsible for almost 80 percent of Sumatran tiger deaths, according to TRAFFIC, a global wildlife trade monitoring network.
Sumatran tigers are considered critically endangered by protection group the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with fewer than 400 believed to remain in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Regulators ponder new rules to temper Big Tech data advantage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Global banking regulators say the arrival of Big Tech firms like Google, Amazon and Apple in financial services poses a host of stability risks that may require sweeping new laws to level the playing field with smaller tech firms and banks.
The report by the Financial Stability Board acknowledges that the entry of Big Tech firms into finance has numerous benefits, including the potential for greater innovation, diversification and efficiency in the provision of financial services. "However, Big Tech firms may also pose risks to financial stability," states the report.Some risks are similar to those from financial firms more broadly, stemming from leverage, maturity transformation and liquidity mismatches, as well as operational risks. More worrying is Big Tech's capacity to scale and ultimately come to dominate given their significant resources and widespread access to customer data. The FSB hints that the imposition of Open Banking rules that force incumbent financial services firms to share customer data with third party providers, may have to shift into reverse in the case of Big Tech, to create a more level-playing field for banks and smaller fintech firms to compete.“Big Tech firms’ ability to leverage customer data raises the question of whether - and the degree to which - authorities could consider the potential to promote the mobility of data between the various actors that are involved in the provision of financial services,” the FSB states. “Doing so may help encourage competition and help ensure a level playing field amongst market participants.” The FSB says regulators and supervisors also need to be mindful of the resilience and the viability of the business models of incumbent firms given interlinkages with, and competition from, Big Tech firms.Similarly, third-party dependencies in cloud services create a number of operational, governance and oversight considerations, the FSB believes, particularly in a cross-border context linked to the potential concentration of Big Tech providers, like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. While there do not appear to be immediate financial stability risks stemming from the use of cloud services by financial institutions, the FSB remains in watchful mode, suggesting that further assessment of regulatory standards, information sharing and interoperability across cloud providers could be merited.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bison Trails Founder on Libra Membership & $25.5M Funding Round</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The adoption of blockchain technology is on the rise–slowly, perhaps, but surely. The market has grown considerably over the last several years, and is expected to continue to increase in size; analyst Shanghong Liu predicts that global spending on blockchain infrastructure will increase to $16 billion by the year 2023, up nearly seven times from the $2.7 that is projected to have been spent this year.
Therefore, the demand for services that can help companies and other organizations build out their blockchain platforms is likely to increase considerably. Recently, Finance Magnates spoke to Joe Lallouz, founder and CEO of Bison Trails. Bison Trails is an NYC-based blockchain infrastructure firm that helps to build enterprise-grade solutions for entities that offer blockchain-based products and services.

Bison trails is also a founding member of the Libra Association and completed a $25.5 million funding round last month. We asked Joe about Bison Trails’ decision to join Libra, how Bison Trails plans to use its funding, what the future holds for the company, and what needs to happen before the world sees mainstream adoption of blockchain.
Joe Lallouz explained to Finance Magnates that the firm works to provide “a multi-cloud, geographically distributed infrastructure platform with enterprise-grade security, orchestration, redundancy, and scaling to run highly efficient nodes on blockchain networks.”
What does this mean on a practical level? “Running nodes that participate on blockchain protocols is very challenging,” Joe explained. So, Bison Trails has “built a VPS-independent platform that makes running participation node clusters effortless, helping to keep decentralized networks decentralized.”
For example, Bison Trails could be hired to help entities that have built decentralized applications (dApps) on top of a blockchain network run the operations necessary to make sure that their dApp is functioning properly.
“We’re also protocol-agnostic,” Joe added. “We want to help grow the entire blockchain ecosystem, to democratize access, and to enable the pioneers of tomorrow.”
Therefore, Bison Trails’ goal is to “increase reliability while reducing costs and overhead for our customers. By serving as a dedicated team of Protocol, Security, DevOps, and Infrastructure Engineering experts, we remove the need for our customers to develop those capacities in-house.”
“We help our customers with all of their infrastructure needs: launching; managing, monitoring, and scaling; securing their infrastructure; and handling network upgrades,” he continued.
Joe explained that “our technology platform provides enterprise-grade security, multi-cloud and multi-region distribution, and a 99.99% uptime guarantee.”
The service is available to “anyone looking for an easier way to participate in established and emerging blockchain networks or those looking to implement blockchain infrastructures into their businesses.”
“Our focus is providing validating infrastructure for custodians, exchanges, Fortune 500 companies, and funds. We’re the preferred infrastructure provider for key protocol projects & a trusted brand,” Joe added.
So far, Bison Trails has been hired by “leading exchanges, custodians, funds and token-holders. Our platform is unique and live, ahead of major protocol launches.”
Bison Trails is also a founding member of the Libra Association, the entity formed by Facebook that will eventually be responsible for running the nodes of the Libra blockchain network. If (or when) Libra is successfully launched, Facebook intends for Libra to serve as a global financial network that will bank the unbanked and be used as a means to easily send payments across borders.
Joe said that Bison Trails’ decision to become a part of the Libra association is “consistent with our approach for every blockchain protocol on the Bison Trails Platform.”
“Our goal is to ensure the Libra network is decentralized, secure, and well-orchestrated, with the infrastructure in place to support billions of transactions,” he told Finance Magnates.
Joe also explained that the decision to participate in Libra stems from the alignment of the two entities’ values: “the Libra network is designed to be transparent by default. It represents a major leap forward towards a financially inclusive world. This aligns well with our vision of democratizing access to the decentralized future.”
“At Bison Trails, we want to see the entire blockchain ecosystem flourish. The scale of the Libra network vision is ambitious,” Joe said. “We anticipate this launch moving the world much closer to the mass adoption of cryptocurrency, potentially triggering a global inflection point towards decentralization.”
Even if Libra ultimately doesn’t launch, Joe said that the company is eager to involve itself with projects that have similar goals and similar scales: “we’d be thrilled to be a part of similar initiatives and a few upcoming ones in the works already,” he told Finance Magnates.

Beyond its involvement in Libra or similar potential involvement in similar projects, Joe explained that “Bison Trails is on a mission to help grow the entire blockchain ecosystem, to democratize access and to enable the pioneers of tomorrow.”
Indeed, “Bison Trails’ goal is to enable pioneers to drive business and society forward while opening up new pathways for innovation,” Joe explained.
“By bringing transparency and ease to entrepreneurs bold enough to build in a decentralized ecosystem, investors wise enough to back a nascent market, and enterprises courageous enough to commit to a technological inevitability like blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, Bison Trails is enabling greater access and participation in the decentralized future.”
Joe said that he believes that “for blockchain technology to reach mainstream adoption, it needs to be abstracted away from the user experience so that mainstream users of these products don’t need to necessarily understand or directly interact with the blockchain itself.”
“Bison Trails is empowering entrepreneurs and companies to engage and build these better products and services on the blockchain using transformative technology, through our platform and services. By making this easier, more efficient, and more cost-effective, Bison Trails helps teams focus on improving their core experience and is helping build a future where blockchain is a mainstream technology.”
Recently, the firm raised $25.5 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Blockchain Capital; Joe explained that the money would be used to “help us continue to be the easiest and safest way to participate in a blockchain network securely through staking, voting, and validating.”
“We will be opening the platform out of limited beta to a wider market, and are excited to announce our new network roadmap which includes: NuCypher, Near, Libra, Telegram, Edgeware, Skale, Polkadot, Solana, Mobilecoin, Coda, Enigma, Ava, Ethereum 2.0, Celo, Keep, Filecoin, Dfinity, etc,” Joe continued.
“We are also excited to share that this funding will allow us to grow our team to meet market demand and pursue new opportunities which include building [and] announcing partnerships with leading exchanges and custodians.”
And what of the company’s competition within the space? Joe explained that there isn’t much concern–”we don’t have many real competitors from a technical perspective,” he said.
“Although there are several companies offering similar technology platforms, we believe our platform is the most robust when it comes to secure, scalable block-production and protocol participation infrastructure…We’re the only platform built with enterprise-grade key management solutions.”
Where does Joe see the company in five years?
“In any space with emerging technology, some innovations will succeed and find traction while other efforts will not,” he told Finance Magnates.
“While we can’t realistically predict which new protocols and initiatives will see mainstream adoption in 5 years, it’s safe to say we’ll remain true to our protocol-agnostic approach as a company.”
“We envision a future in which Bison Trails’ technology and services support the entire ecosystem’s growth, democratizing access to the decentralized future and enabling pioneers from the United States and around the world to build on the blockchain securely.”
As for the year ahead, Joe said that the company would be focusing on “opening the platform, out of a limited beta, to a wider market,” as well as “actively working with founding members [of the Libra Association] to move the technology forward, from testnet to mainnet launch.” Bison Trails will also be working on building its internal team and creating new partnerships.
The company’s “new network roadmap” includes NuCypher, Near, Libra, Telegram, Edgeware, Skale, Polkadot, Solana, Mobilecoin, Coda, Enigma, Ava, Ethereum 2.0, Celo, Keep, Filecoin, Dfinity, Tupelo, and others.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Properly taxing earnings from crypto is a major debate topic all over the world; however, the South Korean government has finally found a way.
The South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to impose capital gains tax on digital currencies, The Korea Times reported on Sunday.
Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo
Per the sources of the local publication, the ministry is aiming to prepare the first draft of the bill by the first half of next year.
“Related discussions have been taking place […] The revised bill will be drawn up by the first half of next year,” an anonymous official from the ministry told the publication.
#FBS2020: FBS Gives Away Lucky Gift Boxes in A New Year PromoGo to article >>
However, the report also outlined that the government will not rely on the approval of the upcoming bill – it is prepared to levy capital gains tax on incomes from digital currencies anyway. The government, however, should put a clear definition of cryptocurrency.
Moreover, it is also not clear whether the government is planning to implement the gains tax similar to profits from stock trading or real estate transactions.
The South Korean government is already collecting trading data from the crypto exchanges operating in the country, which is essential to impose a tax on such incomes.
Several other countries are also considering to impose similar taxation on crypto earnings. Last month, Ukraine proposed a similar bill for crypto gains tax. If passed, the nationals need to pay a five percent tax on crypto for the first five years, and afterward, the government will levy the standard 18 percent tax.
Meanwhile, several other crypto-related bills are pending with the South Korean Assembly for approval. The government is also determined to strengthen know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules and proposed an act to mandate banks to issue only real-name accounts to crypto exchanges.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juice Wrld, the fast-rising young American rapper best known for his 2018 hit Lucid Dreams, has died shortly after suffering a seizure at Chicago’s Midway Airport. He was 21 years old.
A statement from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said that Jarad A. Higgins had died on Sunday, according to The New York Times. The statement did not give a cause of death.
The news was first reported by TMZ, which cited law enforcement sources saying that the rapper experienced a seizure while walking through the airport, and was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after.
Born and raised in Chicago, Juice had enjoyed a rapid ascension since he first began posting his songs to SoundCloud as a teenager in 2015, working in a style that blended elements of emo and rock with hip-hop.
His independently-released 2017 track Lucid Dreams proved to be a career-maker, rising steadily until an official single release in 2018 broke him on to the pop charts, where the song would peak at No. 2.
Signing to Interscope Records in early 2018, Juice released his debut album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, almost immediately after, which was certified platinum before the end of the year, and contained yet another No. 2 single in All Girls Are the Same.
His busy year continued with a summer in memoriam EP dedicated to late fellow SoundCloud rappers XXXTentacion and Lil Peep; a collaborative album with Future, Wrld on Drugs, which reached No. 2 on the album chart in October; and an original song on the soundtrack for the film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
Juice released his second album, Death Race for Love, earlier this year. It was his first effort to reach No. 1 on the album chart. Also this year, he toured Europe with Nicki Minaj on a co-headlining bill.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman attacked, seriously injured by tigers she raised at California animal sanctuary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC/CNN) - The founder of a California animal sanctuary was seriously injured while in the cage with several tigers during a special event for donors.
Wildlife Environmental Conservation founder Patty Perry suffered several cuts and puncture wounds in the Saturday incident. She remains hospitalized as officials investigate.
Michael Bradbury, Perry’s friend and WEC attorney, says Perry went into the cage with the four tigers as she does every day.
"They began to play with her, and the Bengal took both paws and wrapped them around her legs. She fell on the ground and another tiger jumped on her and began to pull on her before they got her out, and she got some lacerations," he said.
Several witnesses, including members of the fire department, rushed to Perry's aid.
Bradbury says Perry is heartbroken by what happened and said she knows the animals didn’t mean to harm her.
“A lot of people, I’m sure, that saw it were horrified, thinking the worst. She said it was obvious they were playing with her because they do love her. She raised them from babies,” Bradbury said.
Bradbury said animal control is aware of the incident, but he doesn't expect any repercussions.
"It's never happened before. She's gone in on hundreds of occasions," he said.
Perry plans on returning to her tigers as soon as she’s released from the hospital. She has 50 animals at her facility, including zebras, birds of prey and leopards.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Put your thumb and index finger together and make the “finger heart” gesture, for South Korean actress/singer Jeon Hye-bin has tied the knot and held a private wedding ceremony right here in Bali. 
After having announced earlier this month that she would marry her boyfriend, who remains unnamed, the 36-year-old shared on Instagram that she they finally married at a private ceremony in Bali on Saturday in front of their family members and close friends. 
Jeon Hye-bin kept details about the event closely guarded, so it’s unclear exactly where in Bali the ceremony took place.
The caption of her post reads as follows, as translated by K-pop news outlet Soompi: 
Hello, this is Jeon Hye Bin.
This year has been so special for me. With many things going on, I met a person I love and am now making an eternal promise with him, he has a great character and personality, and he is able to connect with me deeply. We are much happier and more stable when we are together, so we decided to get married and live for each other.
With the sudden wedding announcement, I was not able to even tell those around me. I was worried that it would interfere with my drama, and I was worried that it would cause a disturbance to the family who will be welcoming me. Please understand and I hope you will still be willing to give your congratulations.
I will become a bride who can take care of him, always make him happy and lucky. We will be a couple who can share with each other and experience good things.
Please watch over us with love.
Jeon Hye-bin began her career in showbiz as a singer in 2002, becoming a member of the short-lived three-member girl group called LUV, which was disbanded after just six months due to their lack of popularity. After that, she released her first solo album titled Love Somebody and then ventured into acting through popular K-drama Sang Doo! Let’s Go to School in 2003 — starring K-pop superstar Rain — and a horror film titled Dead Friend in 2004. 
Jeon Hye-bin found mainstream success in 2005 thanks to her second album, In My Fantasy, after the release of which she decided to focus on her acting career instead. She has starred in various K-dramas such as Insu, The Queen Mother (2011), Gunman in Joseon (2014), Another Oh Hae-young (2016), Life on Mars (2018), Liver or Die (2019), with the most recent one being Leverage, the remake of an American TV series of the same title.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Number of people arrested since protests began breaks 6,000 mark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Police today announced that more than 6,000 people have been arrested since anti-government protests began six months ago.
Speaking to reporters at their regular 4pm press briefing this afternoon, Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of the Police Public Relations Branch confirmed that a total of 6,022 people, aged 11 to 84, have been arrested since protests began on June 9. Of those, 2,393 — or about 40 percent — are students.
Kong also said that 42 people — 37 men, and five women, aged 14 to 63 — were arrested over the weekend for offenses including rioting.
Police noted that at least 340 of those arrested were under 16, and that more than 900 people — about 15 percent of the total number arrested — have been formally charged.
In addition to the arrest figures, police also gave a rundown of crowd control weapons used since protests began. Officers have fired around 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 bean bag rounds, and 1,850 so-called “sponge grenades” — effectively a larger-caliber rubber bullet — since protests began.
They also confirmed that since June, the Complaints Against Police Office has received about 1,300 complaints against officers. They declined to comment on whether any officers had been formally suspended from duty.
Separately, the Hospital Authority has also confirmed that a total of 2,633 people have taken to hospital because of injuries sustained while taking part in protests, RTHK reports.
Six months ago today, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to express their opposition to a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland.
After months of massive protests, the extradition bill was finally withdrawn, but by then the government’s heavy-handed response to demonstrations had given rise to four other key demands, including an independent commission of inquiry into police brutality, the retraction of the the term “riot” to describe a largely peaceful June 12 protest that saw the first use of tear gas, amnesty for arrested protesters, and universal suffrage in electing the city’s leader.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Members of the public are being given the chance to be trained in counter-terrorism, for free.
An online course (ACT Awareness) is now available, which is made up of seven modules and takes 45 minutes to complete.
The coaching has been tailored by security experts and police officers, aiming to enable people to respond readily to major incidents.
It follows the London Bridge attack, which highlights the need for vigilance, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said.
Previously, only those who worked in crowded areas were offered training.
The NPCC said the decision to open up the opportunity to the public was not made in response to the attack.
Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi, senior national co-ordinator for protective security, said: "The threat level remains at substantial, meaning an attack is likely, so giving everyone the chance to be extra eyes and ears for police and local security teams helps to keep all communities safe."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chucklefish Apologises for "Insensitive" Wargroove Casting Choices</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wargroove developer Chucklefish has apologised over its casting process for the game’s upcoming DLC. In a statement on Twitter last week, the studio said that it “sincerely [apologised] for the harm we have caused.”
Last month, Chucklefish revealed the voice actors for Wargroove’s Double Trouble DLC. Three of the expansion’s four new arrivals are characters of colour, but all of them are voiced by white actors, resulting in a backlash from the community.
In response, Chucklefish said that “we want to be honest about what happened. During our casting process we knew that we didn’t want our own unconscious biases to impact who we hired to work on Wargroove.” As a result, the studio hired an external casting company, and handled auditions “blindly,” considering only audition files rather than headshots and back catalogues.
The studio also said that “posting photos of our voice actors beside characters of colour without acknowledgement of the systemic problem of representation in the industry was insensitive and poorly communicated.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">China's Massive Microsoft Gut-Punch Won't Hurt MSFT Bull Run</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over the next three years, offices of public institutions and government agencies in China have to replace foreign software and equipment. That means, no more Microsoft for public offices by 2022.
The abrupt decision of the government of China to essentially ban the usage of American software and computer equipment companies for state-funded offices moves in line with the Made in China 2025 initiative issued by Premier Li Keqiang in 2015.
Four years ago, China established an ambitious vision to move away from manufacturing cheap goods to higher-value products. It focuses on sectors like automotive, aerospace, IT, and robotics, which China has struggled to dominate in recent years.
The move to eliminate China’s dependence on tech giants like Microsoft, Dell, and HP indicates that the government will position itself to fuel most of the country’s IT-related operations with local technologies.
Last month, at the East Tech West conference in China, Alain Crozier, Microsoft’s CEO for the Greater China region, told CNBC that the main source of revenue for the company in China is helping Chinese companies expand into overseas markets.
He said:
Hence, Microsoft does not really target Chinese consumers based in China as its priority market but rather Chinese companies that are looking to serve overseas consumers and users.
More importantly, Crozier noted that the company tries to focus on things it can control, hinting that the trade war and other geopolitical risks are unlikely to affect the firm to a large extent.
He said:
Microsoft has also been looking to move production out of China since July amidst ongoing trade disputes.
China already previously banned Windows 8 for security concerns in 2014, surprising Microsoft. At the time, a Microsoft spokesperson said that it would work proactively with government agencies to ensure their products meet the requirements.
The spokesperson stated:
As such, China’s concern regarding potential security issues with foreign software are not something new, and it dates back to almost five years ago.
The removal of foreign software from public offices in itself is unlikely to have any major impact on Microsoft and its business in China.
The vast majority of Huawei laptops run on Windows and beginning on November 29, Microsoft is allowed to sell software to the Chinese tech conglomerate again.
However, it could pose a long-term to the expansion of Microsoft in the growing Chinese market.
Still, with Microsoft being up more than 49% year-to-date, it will need more than this to affect its bull run.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fact check: Did it really use to snow more often in December in Germany?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For most people, a white Christmas is the ideal. However, snow is quite rare during the holidays in most of Germany. Some say it used to snow more often, but is that really true?
Presents piled under the Christmas tree, piping-hot holiday treats, plus a snow-covered landscape: that's how many imagine the perfect Christmas holidays.
But this combination is relatively rare for Germans. Was a white Christmas more common in the past? Let's look at the facts.
CLAIM: Snow during Christmas was more common in previous years.
FACT: Not true.The German Weather Service, or Der Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD), has strict requirements for a “White Christmas”: there must be at least one centimeter of snow on the ground at 7 am on all festive days (Christmas Eve as well as December 25th and 26th).

"The event was always relatively rare," explains DWD meteorologist Andreas Friedrich. Comprehensive weather data has been collected in all of Germany since 1961, but certain regions have data stretching back to 1881, according to DWD.
In 2010 there was a blanket of snow covering almost all of Germany, and in the 1960s, there were several years in a row where many places in Germany had a white Christmas. However, no general trend can be derived from these individual years, Friedrich says.
Nonetheless, the winters definitely used to be colder. According to DWD data, Germany’s December has warmed by 1.7C since 1881. In December 2018, the average temperature throughout Germany was 3.9C.

"Every children’s book and every advertisement depicts a white Christmas rather than a ‘green Christmas,’ which would be much more realistic in Germany," says Professor Joachim Curtius from the Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research at the University of Frankfurt am Main.
People tend to idealize the rare white Christmas rather than celebrations in bad weather and rain.

CLAIM: White Christmases vary depending on the German region.
FACT: That's true. There are several factors that play into the likelihood of this phenomenon. Altitude, for example, and for some regions, the distance to the ocean also plays a role. On the Heligoland islands the probability for snowy holidays is two percent, according to DWD.
And in Berlin and Brandenburg, the probability of a white Christmas is higher than in Lower Saxony.
CLAIM: There are places in Germany where snow is guaranteed on Christmas
FACT: That's right. "There has been a white Christmas on the Zugspitze since the beginning of the weather record there in 1880," says Friedrich. At lower altitudes, the probability sinks.
CLAIM: The snow probability is highest in December.
FACT: Not true. The coldest times of the year are usually from late January to early February, says DWD expert Friedrich. "If you could push Christmas to these months, it would be easier to experience a white Christmas."
According to DWD figures, it sometimes snows in mid-December, but shortly before Christmas mild Atlantic air often flows from the west to Germany.
“The notorious Christmas Thaw is coming,” writes the DWD. The warm air typically lifts any snow cover.
According to Professor Curtius, the dream of white Christmas will continue to be rare: "In the course of climate change, at least for the next decades, the likelihood of a white Christmas will continue to decline because temperatures will fall below zero less and less often.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eight fascinating things you probably didn't know about Cologne Cathedral</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne Cathedral is one of the most iconic and well-visited buildings in Germany. And it has an incredible history to match the name.1. It took over 600 years to build
The first foundation stone for the Gothic cathedral we see today was laid in August 1248. But lack of money and interest in the project meant that construction was only completed in 1880 with the assistance of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, a mere 632 years later.
2. It was bombed 14 times in WWII

The Cathedral was hit by 14 aerial bombs and more than 70 firebomb hits over the course of the Second World War. Whether by an act of God or just good luck, the building did not collapse and remained standing in an otherwise flattened city. Repairs were finished in 1956 although some bad-quality brickwork was left visible until the 1990's as a reminder of the war.
3. It houses the largest swinging church bell in the world

If you scale the 533 steps up to the South tower to look out at Cologne’s skyline, it’s also worth taking a look at St Peter’s bell while you’re up there. One of the Cathedral’s eight bells, the St Peter's bell weighs 24 tonnes and is the largest of its kind in the world. You'd be lucky to hear it toll, however, as it only rings on special public holidays like Christmas and New Year.
4. Three other churches have stood where the Cathedral is today
Today's Cathedral is supposedly built on the site of a 4th Century Roman Church, which then made way for another church in the 6th Century. This was followed by the so-called Old Cathedral in 800 A.D, which suffered lightning damage and was then burned down 300 years later to make way for the current Cathedral.
5. It was built to house the 'remains of the Three Kings'

When Archbishop Rainald von Dassel brought the "bones of the Three Kings" to Cologne after taking them from Milan when it was conquered in 1164, he was unimpressed with the Old Cathedral and so a new one was planned that would be grand enough to house the relics. From then on, every German king would make a pilgrimage after his coronation to present gifts to the remains. They believed that Christ would thus recognize them as monarch, as he had done with the Three Kings themselves.
6. There are 6 million visitors every year
According to the Cathedral's website, they receive 20,000-30,000 visitors daily, or a whopping 6 million per year. But these astoundingly high numbers aren't surprising when you consider that the Cathedral has previously been voted Germany's best attraction.
7. It was once the tallest building in the world

From 1880 to 1884, the Cathedral was the tallest building in the world, until it was beaten by the Washington Monument and then the Eiffel Tower.
Nowadays, it doesn’t hold anywhere near such an impressive title but it is still the largest Gothic church building in Northern-Europe. Its two 516 ft tall church spires are the second tallest in the world, surpassed only by the single spire of Ulm Minster which was finished in 1890, which is also in Germany.
But when the Sagrada Familia is finished in 2026 (estimated), it will be taller than both the Ulm Minster and Cologne Cathedral, robbing Germany of the title.
8. The Cathedral wasn't always so dark grey
The outside of the Cathedral is not made of black material, nor is it just dirty, instead, the sandstone which most of the building is made from reacts with the sulphuric acid in rain and turns dark grey, giving the Cathedral its distinctive dark colour over time. This is why repaired sections look much whiter and lighter than the rest of the building, although in time they will darken to match the older stone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A seventh and final suspect was also arrested after a deadly attack on a passer-by in Augsburg on Friday evening.
A spokesman for the Augsburg police headquarters said on Monday that all of the suspects have now been caught.
A 49-year-old professional firefighter had been killed on Friday evening in an argument with a group of young men at Königsplatz in the centre of Augsburg in Bavaria.
The man had been at the city’s Christmas market with his wife and a couple of friends, before dining in a nearby restaurant.
There the two couples met a group of seven young men with whom they got into an argument. One of the men hit the victim in the head, causing him to fall to the ground.
His 50-year-old companion was also beaten by the group and injured in the face. The two women were not attacked and remained unharmed.

The perpetrators then fled. Emergency doctors tried to resuscitate the man on site, but the 49-year-old died in the ambulance.
Investigators arrested the first two 17-year-old suspects on Sunday.
The video surveillance, which the police installed at Augsburg's Königsplatz in December 2018, helped with the search.
One 17-year-old suspect is a German who also has Turkish and Lebanese citizenship. The other 17-year-old is a native of Augsburg with Italian citizenship.
Investigators will announce further details of the case at a press conference on Monday afternoon, they said.
Over 100 firemen held a moment of silence for their colleague at the scene of the crime on Sunday, and also laid flowers and lit candles.
Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder also gave his condolences: "We are all shaken. All our sympathies go to the fireman's family."
Surveillance ‘made the work of police much easier’
Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann (CSU) stressed the importance of video surveillance during arrests after the fatal attack.
"The images made the work of the police much easier", the CSU politician told the Augsburger Allgemeine.
The video surveillance at Königsplatz, the central point for public transport in the city, was not put in place until December 2018 as part of a state programme, the newspaper reported.

Since then, the police have been monitoring the area with 15 cameras.
"We have always pushed this, and such cases show that the demand has proven to be right," Herrmann added.
It difficult for eyewitnesses to describe the perpetrators of a crime precisely, which is why video recordings are the most important for the investigation, he said.
However, Hermann said that video surveillance should be restricted. He said: "We don't want total surveillance, it only exists in authoritarian states.”
Instead, he said, the focus should be on trying to prevent “excessive violence” in public spaces in the first place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Luno Planning To Add Ripple To Its List By Early 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Luno, the cryptocurrency exchange, seems to be making waves of late. Less than a month after it officially announced its comeback in Malaysia and plans to expand its cryptocurrency list, the company recently announced that it was planning on making Ripple (XRP) one of the first alternative coins (altcoins) available on the exchange.
According to an exclusive interview with The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), Ripple has already been approved by the Securities Commission (SC), and that Luno will be bringing the cryptocurrency onboard the exchange sometime during the beginning of 2020.
According to Vijay Ayyar, Head of Luno in Asia, the digital currency is still not yet listed on Luno, but that is a possibility that the company is exploring. At this point, the company’s main priority was retaining customer safety and compliance with regulations. Ayyar also told TMR that the adoption of Ripple could roll the cryptocurrency market further along.
XRP was created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based currency exchanged that was founded in 2012. After Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has the third-largest market capitalisation of US$9.2 billion (~RM38.3 billion).

    <h5 class="mb-1">How global cities are promoting sustainability and helping to fight climate change - CityAM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2016 Paris Agreement gave the world a sense of hope that politicians could work together to limit temperature rises to 2 degrees centigrade. However, much has changed since the milestone agreement. More frequent extreme weather events, increasing political nationalism and growing economic inequality are making the goal of a carbon neutral world by 2050 harder to achieve. Schroders’ Climate Progress Dashboard is currently indicating that global temperatures are likely to rise by 3.8 degrees by 2025
As investors in global cities, we seek to ensure that each holding is analysed on its sustainability credentials during the investment process, including its impact on the environment. On a recent visit to Paris we learnt more about how the publicly listed French commercial and residential landlord Gecina is demonstrating leadership in the transition to a more sustainable city. Paris is ranked 17th in our Global Cities Index and 90 per cent of Gecina’s portfolio is located within the Paris region (as of the end of 2018). Their ambition to own sustainable urban assets is a key reason for our interest in the company.
With control over local planning, taxes and energy supply, the mayors of leading global cities are setting ambitious climate action plans to meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement. Paris has its own climate agency to deliver theirs and sits on the steering committee of the C40 Cities group that is sharing sustainability best practice globally.
Local real estate owners will play an important role in achieving these plans, as buildings and the construction industry account for around 40 per cent of global carbon emissions.
Ambitions are agreed at executive level and structured around the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Getting these targets approved by third parties, such as the Carbon Trust and Science Based Targets initiative, adds validity to this process.
Gecina has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and has cut its emissions by 32 per cent since 2008, half way to its 2030 target.
2. Using renewable energy
Energy consumption is a key contributor to overall carbon emissions from buildings, with around 80 per cent still supplied by fossil fuels globally.
Gecina recently developed an office building called “Be Issy”, which produces more energy than it consumes using 960 square metres of photo-voltaic cells and geothermal heat pumps. However, sufficient renewable energy cannot be generated on site in all cases. Much rests on tenants once buildings are occupied, with “green leases” one way to incentivise good practice.
Cities such as Paris are also introducing district urban heat and cooling networks that can improve energy efficiency by 50 per cent. With occupiers seeking to achieve their own sustainability goals, developers hope that such innovations will strengthen tenant demand and landlord pricing power.
3. Reducing embodied carbon in the development process
The vast majority of emissions come from inefficient older buildings. One of Gecina’s most ambitious projects to date is the redevelopment and consolidation of two former office buildings on Rue De Courcelles, also targeting a carbon neutral design. This includes using wood in the structure to store carbon (and reduce concrete emission intensity), a greenhouse on the roof and renewable energy production.
4. Reducing waste and recycling old materials
Landlords are seeking to avoid sending waste to landfill by integrating so-called circular economy design principles into their projects. This involves reusing existing property, plant and equipment. For example, two-thirds of the existing marble façade at Gecina’s other major redevelopment – L1ve – is to be reused as flooring in the new building entrance, saving money and cutting waste.
5. Providing access to low emission transport
Locating new developments near major transport hubs promotes sustainable travel and cuts indirect portfolio carbon emissions. Developers are also increasingly including electric vehicle charging stations in their developments as global cities prepare for a future free of petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.
6. Reintroducing biodiversity and green space
Maintaining existing and integrating new green spaces helps to sustain biodiversity and remove carbon from the atmosphere. Gecina’s L1ve office redevelopment will include 2,800 square metres of gardens and terraces within the building’s footprint.
7. Accessing sustainable financing
Green bonds are subject to reporting on environmental and social obligations, with the funds often used to invest in sustainable properties and projects. This new source of capital is growing rapidly. Gecina has structured 20 per cent of its borrowing as “sustainable improvement loans”.
8. Certifying buildings to “grade A” standards
Financial conditions for Gecina’s sustainable loans are indexed against the group’s corporate social responsibility performance. This includes certifications such as GRESB, which provides ESG benchmarking for real assets. Building certification gives investors, lenders and occupiers confidence that developers’ ambitions around building standards can be achieved. Tracking these standards across a portfolio can demonstrate improvements in energy efficiency, health and well-being, accessibility, connectivity and biodiversity. These attributes are also becoming increasingly important to occupiers seeking happy and productive staff.
Gecina is demonstrating global leadership in its transition to a more sustainable real estate portfolio, seeking to contribute to the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. A more environmentally friendly portfolio should benefit from reduced operating costs, better access to capital and stronger tenant demand, thereby also creating an inherently more sustainable business model. We believe this transition is therefore not only the right thing to do from a social perspective, but also makes financial sense for investors.
Gecina is one of the core holdings in the Global Cities Real Estate Fund (as of October 2019) and is used above for illustrative purposes of how a sustainable portfolio can be achieved.

Global Cities Fund – Risk Considerations
Changes in China’s political, legal, economic or tax policies could cause losses or higher costs for the fund. The counterparty to a derivative or other contractual agreement or synthetic financial product could become unable to honour its commitments to the fund, potentially creating a partial or total loss for the fund. The fund can be exposed to different currencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates could create losses. A derivative may not perform as expected, and may create losses greater than the cost of the derivative. Emerging markets, and especially frontier markets, generally carry greater political, legal, counterparty and operational risk.
Equity prices fluctuate daily, based on many factors including general, economic, industry or company news. The fund uses derivatives for leverage, which makes it more sensitive to certain market or interest rate movements and may cause above-average volatility and risk of loss.
In difficult market conditions, the fund may not be able to sell a security for full value or at all. This could affect performance and could cause the fund to defer or suspend redemptions of its shares.
Failures at service providers could lead to disruptions of fund operations or losses.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tougher accountability rules have today been extended to cover around 47,000 firms across the financial sector, as the financial watchdog seeks to clean up the City’s reputation following a string of scandals. 
The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) holds firms’ senior managers directly accountable for their actions, and is intended to help regulators punish the right people quickly for failures on their watch.

The new regulation, which was initially introduced to cover banks and insurers three years ago, is today being rolled out to cover all asset managers, independent financial advisers and hedge fund managers regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
“SMCR fundamentally swings the pendulum of personal accountability for wrongdoing from the trading floor to the boardroom,” said Quinn Perrot, co-founder of regulation-focused fintech Traction.
The introduction of the tougher rules come at the end of a year during which regulators have trained their sights on the fund industry following scandals including the collapse of Neil Woodford’s investment empire. 
Concerns were raised when SMCR was introduced in 2016 that the rules would make it harder to find staff willing to take on the additional responsibility, but legal experts generally view the enforcement of the regime by the FCA and Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Regulation Authority division as negligible. 
DLA Piper partner Michael McKee said the implementation of SMCR “will not seem like a step change at first” for many firms.

“However, the challenges associated with the SMCR come from the change in supervisory expectations on boards and senior managers and in the impact of enforcement action – when this is taken,” he added. “

    <h5 class="mb-1">Late payments: Firms wait twice as long for cash in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK’s small and medium-sized businesses are being stretched by customers failing to pay them on time, according to a survey from business body Market Finance.
Firms had to wait an average of 23 days to receive their money in 2019, the survey found, up from 12 days in 2018.

Industry groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have decried what they term the late payment crisis, which they say is hurting small businesses at an already challenging time.
Market Finance found that the professional and legal services sector suffered with late payment the most in 2019. Seven in ten invoices were paid late, up from 30 per cent in 2018.
Six in ten manufacturing invoices were paid late, while 50 per cent of retailers had to wait for their money.
Late payment practices improved for companies working in the utilities and energy sector with only a third of invoices being paid late in 2019 compared to two-thirds in 2018.
There was a marginal improvement in the number of invoices paid on time, however, with 39 per cent of invoices paid late in 2019, up from 43 per cent in 2018.
Bilal Mahmood, external relations director at Market Finance, said: “It’s great to see that fewer invoices were paid late in 2019 but worryingly, those that were paid late took twice as long.”

He added: “Late payment practices harm business cash flow, hampers investment and, in extreme cases, can risk business solvency.”
Mahmood said watchdogs “need more bite” so they can better crack down on late payments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crypto Is Money: Dai Stablecoin Support Arrives on Coinbase Debit Card</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TwitterFacebookWhatsAppGoogle+BufferLinkedIn
If you can spend cryptocurrency in mainstream society, then crypto is money — at least so says the tech’s biggest proponents.
Following that line of thought, the Dai — the Ethereum community’s darling stablecoin — definitely just took another decisive step toward “currency” status, insofar as U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase revealed on December 6th it had added Dai support to its “Coinbase Card” debit card offering.
Accordingly Dai joins the card, which was launched back in the spring and is currently only available in the United Kingdom and the European Union, as its 10th addition, with the assets it already supports including (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP, Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), 0x (ZRX), and Stellar lumens (XLM).
As such, Coinbase’s European users can now spend their Dai holdings for everyday purchases, which for many Dai proponents is the point of using the stablecoin in the first place — to spend your stable Dai while holding your volatile ETH, as it were, since each Dai is worth approximately $1 USD. On the flip side, ether — which is more akin to a commodity — has considerably more investment upside and considerably more risk.
The development is another step toward mainstream adoption for the stablecoin, whose builders undertook a rebranding last month in order to make the “dollar coin’s” aesthetics more in line with other major world currencies.
Wyre, known by some as the “Stripe” of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, explained more this week on their platform’s coming “meta transactions” capability, which the company said will arrive in 2020 and will allow users to interact wither Ethereum decentralized finance applications directly from their debit cards.
Specifically, Wyre said meta transactions would “effectively turn … Apple Pay or Google Pay wallets into secure Ethereum wallets to fund [DeFi] transactions.”
That’s a big deal, because one pain point for new users to cryptocurrency has been the knowledge gap, e.g. not knowing where to begin. With fiat DeFi on-ramps, Wyre will make Ethereum’s dApps more readily accessible to everyday users, which should drive adoption in turn.
Last month, the Maker community — stewards of the Dai stablecoin — undertook their biggest evolutionary action to date in voting, and thereafter activating, Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD).
Prior to MCD, Maker dApp users could only draw out automated Dai loans using ether as collateral. In the wake of MCD, more cryptocurrencies beyond ETH can now be used as collateral for Maker loans. The first additional crypto to be voted in by MKR token holders was Basic Attention Token.
With that said, MCD is set to supersede the previously reigning “Single-Collateral Dai,” which is now known as Sai. Assuming liquidity is available, Sai holders can migrate their tokens to Dai at any time using a special migration smart contract deployed by Maker’s builders.
At press time, there 45.5 million Dai and 58.5 million Sai in circulation, meaning the new MCD version of the stablecoin has come close to “flippening” its predecessor in number.
Maybe, maybe not. But it’s clear the decentralized stablecoin has structural and timing advantages over America’s actual dollar minters at the U.S. Treasury.
Why? Firstly, because the Dai is already here and useful for people around the world while top U.S. officials have no plans for releasing a digital dollar any time soon. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin just told American legislators that the government isn’t putting USD on the blockchain for the foreseeable future.
Secondly, the Dai is permissionless to a degree that the U.S. government likely doesn’t agree with. Yet it is growing increasingly popular for that very reason.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. Dollar Czar: “No Need” for Fed Issuing Digital Dollar in Next 5 Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TwitterFacebookWhatsAppGoogle+BufferLinkedIn
In recent weeks, there has been growing talk among influential U.S. figures concerning the prospects of “digitizing” the dollar via blockchain technology.
Yet there are two major American officials who have once again said they are decidedly skeptical of a digital dollar any time soon:  Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
That’s per comments made this week to the U.S. Congress by Sec. Mnuchin, who testified on Thursday before the House of Representative’s Financial Services Committee regarding the topic of America’s financial stability. Therein, Mnuchin — President Trump’s foremost economic adviser — said he and Chairman Powell, the current head of the U.S. central banking system, were of the same opinion that a Fed-backed blockchain dollar wasn’t near.
“[Fed Chairman] Powell and I have discussed this at length: we both agree that in the near future, in the next five years, we see no need for the Fed to issue a digital currency,” Mnuchin said.
It’s not exactly a surprising position. This year, Sec. Mnuchin has made it clear that he’s generally skeptical toward the cryptocurrency space. Back in July, Mnuchin declared “I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin.” Around the same time, he said U.S. regulatory agencies were coordinating on cryptocurrencies to foster a “unified approach.”
Moreover, Sec. Mnuchin’s latest digital dollar comments come on the heels of the U.S. Treasury releasing its “2019 Annual Report,” wherein his department concluded that stablecoins could have major impacts on America’s economy if they were ever to become “widely adopted as a means of payment.”
For his part, Fed Chairman Powell told Congress last month that the Fed was considering a central bank digital currency but had yet to actively start developing one:
“[T]he Federal Reserve is not currently developing a U.S. dollar central bank digital currency … but continues to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of issuing a general purpose CBDC, defined as a new type of Federal Reserve liability that could be held directly by households or businesses,” Powell said.
Notably, the chatter comes after former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo argued in October that America should transition the dollar onto blockchain technology. Just this week, Giancarlo joined the Willkie Farr & Gallagher law firm, where he said he would continue working to back a digital dollar.
In his aforementioned congressional hearing, Sec. Mnuchin also touched on Facebook’s Libra stablecoin project, which has caught the ire of regulators around the world since June.
While financial authorities in France and Germany have said they intend to block the Libra altogether from coming to Europe, Sec. Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee that he would be agreeable to Libra moving forward in the U.S. so long as its backers followed all of the required finance laws.
“I’m fine if Facebook wants to get into digital payments … and that may be good for their customer base and good for a lot of Americans who don’t have access to banks … we want to make sure if they do it they’re doing it in a way that is fully compliant,” Mnuchin said.
American may not be close to releasing a digital dollar, though other countries are nearing their own digital currencies.
This week, the Bank of France said it would undertake trials around a digital euro in 2020. That announcement is only the latest of its kind, as nations like China and Turkey are already well along in rapidly developing their own digital currencies.
If the U.S. waits much longer, it’ll left behind in the dust where digital money is concerned.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David Bermantook his own life in August just days before his new project Purple Mountains were to have started their first-ever tour. There has been an outpouring of love since, with tributes and benefit shows, most recently William Tyler’s in Nashville that featured a number of other former Silver Jews live members (including Berman’s widow, Cassie).
For those in NYC, there will be a Berman tribute/benefit happening at Union Pool on January 4, which would’ve been his 53rd birthday. Dubbed “DCBday,” the night will feature members of Silver Jews and Purple Mountains and proceeds go to Musicares and the NYC chapter of The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Tickets are on sale now.
The full lineup hasn’t been announced yet, but the bands for the night — The Blue Arrangements, The Wild Kindness, Peers in the Punklight and Birds of Virginia — will include Silver Jews players Steve West (who is also in Pavement) and Matt Hunter (also of New Radiant Storm King), and Purple Mountains player Kyle Forester (also of Woods). Singers include Patrick Stickles (Titus Andronicus) with lots more to be announced. Boston’s Hallelujah the Hills will also be on the bill, comedian/musician Chris Crofton will MC the night, and Union Pool will be decorated by artist and album cover designer Steve Keene.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will not speak to the press when he arrives in Oslo Norway this week to receive the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize Award.
But Abiy on Saturday granted an unscheduled interview to a German journalist, Markus Preiss, who was in town with the new head of the European Union Commission.
The interview was on the streets of Addis Ababa with the Prime Minister seated behind the wheel of a car with a fellow passenger and the journalist posing questions from outside.
“We were only filming in the streets of Addis – when a car stopped: How I met Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed,” the journalist wrote. The interaction went as follows:
Markus: You are driving yourself?Abiy: There is no interview, I’m just saying how are you guys doing?
Journalist: Good, how did you find the first visit (of the EU delegation) today?Abiy: Great, amazing, she is a real change maker, we are so happy that she decided to come here first and I hope we will work a very good job with (the) European Union. With the new vibe, with the new leadership we are so happy and grateful.
Journalist: It’s great to see you.Abiy: Great to see you too.Enjoy, enjoy your filming.
Journalist: Good luck in Oslo.Abiy: After tomorrow, yes, I will be there.
Journalist: Congratulations.Abiy: Thank you very much.
It is not the first time Abiy is filmed driving himself. He has in the past driven guests who came to Ethiopia. A typical case in point was the United Arab Emirates Crown Prince in 2018.
When the EU Commission chief was also in Addis Ababa, Abiy took the initiative of driving her around town. Earlier this year whiles on a trip to Eritrea, he actually drove his host President Isaias Afwerki around in Asmara.
On other driving duties, Abiy was behind the wheel of a water tanker late Sunday afternoon watering trees that Ethiopians had planted in a yet-to-be certified world record move earlier this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Column: From ‘Sabre Dance’ to ‘We're Gonna Win That Cup’, music elevates Sabres fans' experience</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the Buffalo Sabres celebrate their 50th year as an NHL franchise in a city and surrounding environs rightly revered collectively as a serious “hockey town,” let's ruminate on the marriage of music and sport.
This phenomenon might not be unique to Buffalo, but as Sabres in-game organist Curtis Cook points out, there are clear inherent connections between sports and the arts in our local culture.
“Buffalonians certainly love their sports and the arts,” Cook said. “I'm lucky enough to be one of the people that help blend those two things together.”
Music has been used to dramatic effect from our team’s beginnings, when an excerpt from composer Aram Khachaturian’s 1942 ballet “Gayane” became the Sabres’ clarion call as they took the ice. That excerpt, known as “Sabre Dance,” has been pumping up the heart rates of players and fans alike virtually without pause since 1970. That tradition will continue Tuesday night in KeyBank Center, as the Sabres return from a Western road trip to host the St. Louis Blues.
(The piece was placed on hiatus briefly in the early 2000s, and the Scorpions’ “Rock You Like A Hurricane” filled the gap, but “Sabre Dance” returned in 2011, and has stayed since.)
“There has been so much influential music throughout the 50 years of this franchise's history,” Cook said. “Everyone knows about ‘Sabre Dance,’ which I still play on the organ at least once a game, at the beginning of a period. I think it's a unique and diverse piece of music and it's been associated with the team for so long that fans of every age can identify it immediately.”
Khachaturian’s piece, which was a huge radio hit in 1948, has gone on to be covered, interpreted, reinterpreted, and reassembled myriad times over the years, in virtually any genre imaginable. Everyone from Woody Herman and Liberace to composer Danny Elfman, vocalist Nina Hagen, violinist Vanessa Maye, and the Brian Setzer Orchestra has taken a swing at the high-energy piece.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg, according to Cook.
“The original ‘Sabre Dance’ with full orchestration is the version that everyone knows, but a lot of people don't realize that it has been covered by more contemporary groups over the years.
"For example, a Belgian group named the Jokers covered it, as did a group called Love Sculpture, featuring Welsh singer/songwriter/guitarist Dave Edmunds in it. Both of those groups covered the song without an orchestra and with more modern instrumentation – electric guitars, electric bass, drums – and I think those versions sound awesome, too.”
Sabres announcer Dan Dunleavy, a self-taught guitarist with a deep and abiding love for music, recently had a dream about "Sabre Dance."
"I quite literally had a dream where I was playing a heavy, riff-y version of 'Sabre Dance' on guitar from the booth as the team takes the ice," he laughed. "I mean, how cool would that be? Maybe someday."
Of course, "Sabre Dance," as invigorating as it remains, doesn’t tell the whole story. Over the years, tunes by artists as diverse as Led Zeppelin (“The Immigrant Song”), DJ Kool (goal song “Let Me Clear My Throat”), Metallica (“Fuel”), Flo Rida (“Low (featuring T-Pain”) and the Who (“Baba O’Riley”) have blasted from the rafters of the old Aud and KeyBank Center between play.
The hometown Goo Goo Dolls' "Better Days" became an anthem for the Sabres' 2007 playoff run.
There have also been locally produced novelty theme songs, many of which have jumped several generation gaps by this point.
“Through the decades, there's been such a connection between fans and songs like 'We're Gonna Win That Cup' (written by Tommy Calandra and performed by Donna McDaniel) from the Sabres’ Stanley Cup run in '75, the radio jingle 'Rock 'em Sabres,' and the (Buffalo Chamber of Commerce-commissioned) 'Buffalo Talkin' Proud' jingle of the '80s,” Cook said.
Maria Sebastian's remake of "We're Gonna Win That Cup" was played frequently during the Sabres' run to the Stanley Cup final in 1999.
“I still play a lot of these songs on the organ," Cook said. "Every time I do, I always have people tweeting me or coming up to me at the game saying that hearing any of those songs I mentioned brought back a certain memory. I love hearing people's stories on how they connect a memory with a certain piece of music.”
“I love ‘Sabre Dance’ and hope it always has some place within their presentation, even if it's just accompanying old highlights or something like that,” WGR 550 AM’s Chris “Bulldog” Parker said. “But I think the team ought to let a different player pick the entrance song each night. Make it a part of the intro, maybe even have the player on the Jumbotron introducing the song and, if they're comfortable enough, saying something about why they chose the song.”
Dunleavy went whole-hog on anthemic arena-rock when asked what song he’d be thrilled to hear as the team takes the ice.
“Queen’s ‘One Vision,’” Dunleavy said, citing the lyrics’ encapsulation of the Sabres fan experience. “'One goal, one fight, one true religion’ – that, for Buffalo, being their Sabres and hockey in general.
"That song represents the Sabres, for sure, but it also represents something that I truly feel is unique about Buffalo. Here, everyone is all-in on everything relating to Buffalo – whether that's the Bills, the Sabres, the development of Main Street, what might happen as Canalside grows, what's gonna become of the Skyway – it doesn't matter the topic, and it doesn't matter if we disagree.
"Having lived in Toronto and traveled to so many different cities, I can say for sure that it's not like that everywhere. From music culture to politics to sports, even if we disagree around here, we all care."
In the end, a winning season comes down to much more than the right song, the right sound, the right lyric and the right fan attitude. The team, of course, needs to do the work. The right music can, at the least, help set the mood and frame the experience for the fans.
“I'm certainly still a fan when I’m working,” Cook said. “I think to be a successful sports organist, you really need to be a fan yourself. You're essentially a cheerleader for 19,000 people, so as a live musician, I can change the mood of the music instantly and in turn, help get the crowd going.
“For example, if play stops and I begin to play a song in a major key that's upbeat and then players start pushing and shoving, I can instantly modulate into a minor key and make the organ music sound like villainous chase music from an old silent film to fit the mood of what is going on down on the ice.”
How is Cook feeling about the Sabres' chances this year?
“I am the eternal optimist,” he said. “No matter what happens, I am always all-in on the Sabres. They were my team even before I started working for them and they always will be my team, no matter what. I always hope we can get to the playoffs, year after year. I always look forward to hockey season starting and getting back to the arena to work and cheer for the guys on the ice.
“I’ve lived here all my life, and I can say for certain that Buffalo has an incredibly, and unusually, loyal fan base.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An African was crowned Miss Universe 2019 over the weekend and she was in the person of South African Zozibini Tunzi. She emerged top of the pack after a night of colourful displays and gruelling aptitude events.
She incorporated colours of the South African flag in her costumes scaling through the different rounds till she was eventually crowned. She was handed the crown by out gone queen Catriona Gray.
Gray, 2018 winner, sandwiches Zozibini and another South African former winner Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters who won the crown in 2017.
The final took place at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, GA USA. Runners-up were Miss Puerto Rico, Madison Anderson and Miss Mexico, Sofía Aragón.
The brief biography of the 26-year-old winner who is from Tsolo read: “Zozibini Tunzi is a passionate activist and engaged in the fight against gender based violence.
“She has devoted her social media campaign to changing the narrative around gender stereotypes. She is a proud advocate for natural beauty and encourages women to love themselves the way they are.”
Ms Tunzi had been a strong voice in campaigning against gender-based violence, GBV, in South Africa. She had at a point urged South African men to write what she described as love letters to the country’s women.
The country has some of the highest rates of GBV figures across Africa. In her response to what young girls needed most in growing up, she cited leadership.
“It’s something that has been lacking in young girls and women for a very long time not because we don’t want to but because of what society has labelled women to be. I think we are the most powerful beings in the world,” she said.
The Miss Universe Organization (MUO) is a global, inclusive organization that celebrates women of all cultures and backgrounds and empowers them to realize their goals through experiences that build self- confidence and create opportunities for success.
They are the organizers of three main pageants: MISS UNIVERSE, MISS USA and MISS TEEN USA which according to their website provides the approximately 10,000 women who participate annually an international platform to effect positive change personally, professionally and philanthropically as inspirational leaders and role models.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Conservative scorecard now a factor in race for NY-27</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If the Conservative Party bestows any “badge of honor” on New York politicians, it might be its perfect score of 100% when assessing State Legislature votes.
And if you’re campaigning for the Republican and Conservative nods in the state’s "reddest" congressional district, no badge may shine brighter.
That’s why Republican State Sen. Robert G. Ortt of North Tonawanda is crowing a bit this week after scoring perfectly in 2019, just as he and others shout their conservative credentials for a special 27th Congressional District election anticipated on April 28.
“It’s a tangible sign that backs up what we have been saying in this process,” Ortt said. “Now the Conservative Party of New York State says it, too.”
Conservatives routinely rate senators and members of the Assembly following each year’s legislative session. And it comes as no surprise that Republicans hailing from the state’s more conservative districts capture top honors.
But the score stands out this year because a possible five Republicans may be angling to succeed Chris Collins in the House of Representatives following his Sept. 30 resignation. More than any other issue at this early stage, each is attempting to out-do the other in emphasizing their rightward leanings.
“Being Conservative isn’t about a party or a label, it’s about standing by the principles of smaller government, less taxes and economic freedom, no matter the cost,” said Republican Assemblyman Steve Hawley of Genesee County, who is contemplating a candidacy and scored 92% in the Conservative Party report.
The scores also weigh more heavily this year because of efforts to paint State Sen. Christopher L. Jacobs of Buffalo – another declared Republican candidate – as “not conservative enough” for the 27th District. Conservatives rated him at 84%, which is far above most Democrats and even above the 80% scored by Senate Minority Leader John J. Flanagan.
Jacobs said Friday he had received a “congratulatory” phone call earlier in the day from state Conservative Chairman Gerard Kassar on his score.
“He called to say I was ‘clearly conservative,’ ” Jacobs said. “I agree.”
The senator noted his lower score stemmed from not voting on two bills included in the Conservative scorecard while he was excused for the birth of his daughter.
“I would have voted with the Conservatives and that would have given me more than 90%,” he said, adding he earned party demerits for supporting measures to reduce greenhouse gases and prohibit coastal oil and gas drilling.
“I don’t agree with any organization 100% of the time,” he said, adding he feels “very confident” that Conservative leaders will back his candidacy when a special election is called.
But Jacobs is continually called upon to defend his conservative credentials, even with a healthy scorecard. Indeed, a Washington political action committee called Club for Growth is already attacking him in mailings and broadcast ads as incompatible with the district’s conservative values and not leaning far enough rightward.
And a potential candidate – Erie County Comptroller Stefan I. Mychajliw Jr. – constantly blasts Jacobs for the same reason, even though he has yet to enter the race.
Former Darien Town Justice Beth A. Parlato is also running and also emphasizes her conservatism, but like Mychajliw received no party score because she is not a legislator.
In addition, the ratings underscore the crucial need for Conservatives and the GOP to settle on one candidate for the special election. If the two parties choose separately, observers note, a Democrat could split the opposition and pull off an upset.
“We’re making our case to the Republicans about the necessity of making sure both parties are unified,” Ortt said. “You don’t want a split on April 28 because that would open an opportunity for the Democrats.”
Erie County Conservative Chairman Ralph C. Lorigo noted the circumstances surrounding Jacobs’ score as well as his “not that bad” 84%. But he added that the ratings will be taken into consideration at nomination time.
He also acknowledged the dilemma of choosing among candidates who all proudly proclaim their conservatism.
“There is no question that the nomination in this case will present a difficult situation for all of us,” he said. “There are good people running for this seat, and a lot to take into account.”
Ortt said last week he would not judge Jacobs or any other colleague in the Legislature because each tries to reflect his or her own district. He said leaders (like Flanagan) often must sign on to compromise measures and that legislators must often represent constituent wishes.
But he also noted that the 2019 session featured a blitz of “extreme and ultra-progressive policies” pushed by the Legislature’s new Democratic majority, and that more conservative votes than usual were required.
“I would think we would all be in the 90s,” he said.
Ortt also said his Senate district resembles a “microcosm” of the 27th District and that he has provided effective representation.
“These are the things I believe in and advocate for,” he said. “I’m not some Johnny-come-lately running for Congress.”
Other Senate scores included 92% for Republicans Patrick M. Gallivan of Elma and 96% for Michael H. Ranzenhofer of Amherst. Democrat Timothy M. Kennedy of Buffalo, who ran with Conservative backing in his first Senate election and while in the Erie County Legislature, scored 12% in the new Conservative report.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The foster children arrived unexpectedly on Gabriel and Jeanette Lopez's wedding day.
Erie County Child Protective Services brought Justice, 6, Bishop, 2, and Angel, 3 months old, to the South Buffalo couple just hours before the ceremony in March 2015 at J's White Elephant in Lackawanna.
"I was getting my hair done for the wedding, and the social worker said they had an emergency situation with the children and were bringing them," Jeanette Lopez recalled.
The couple – the children's aunt and uncle – wasn't expecting the children until after tying the knot but say they wouldn't have had it any other way that day. Or any day since.
"Fostering is an amazing, amazing opportunity to do the ultimate sacrifice to help a child," Gabriel Lopez said. "I wouldn't take it back for anything in the world. Having this opportunity to be in their lives and go through this journey with them, and have them be all together is our greatest accomplishment in life."
Gabriel and Jeanette developed a close friendship growing up blocks from where they now live. It grew into a romantic relationship. The couple became foster parents, in part, because they wanted to ensure the children stayed together rather than run the risk of being separated. They formally adopted them three years later.
That was before Jeanette, who already had suffered from powerful migraines, came down with a debilitating health problem that has caused the family's finances to take a nosedive.
Jeanette Lopez planned events and weddings for a catering company when she came down with myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that was triggered by an injection of Botox in March 2017. Most of her immediate family suffers from autoimmune problems, too.
"She was thriving, got a nice big raise, and was well on her way to having a successful career when she got sick," Gabriel Lopez said.
For two years, Jeanette Lopez was barely able to talk and form words. Surgery to remove her thymus gland helped, but she still has trouble swallowing, suffers from memory loss and is often sapped of energy.
The 37-year-old woman collects Social Security disability insurance and is on Medicare. She's been told her health problems won't allow her to work again.
"I try to limit my activity during the day because I get really tired, and I want to make sure I have enough energy for dinner and to help with the children's homework," she said.
Gabriel Lopez, who works as a grill cook at Outback Steakhouse in Amherst, also has health issues. He is expecting to undergo a fifth hernia surgery in 2020, plus he has developed psoriasis and struggles with his weight.
The couple say it has taken a village to help them keep their heads above water.
They expressed gratitude to their landlord, Lopez's boss at Outback Steakhouse, friends, family and the Valley Community Association, where the children attend day care and after-school programs and attended summer programs, too.
"I don't know how we would have been able to do anything without them," said Jeanette Lopez.
"I can't tell you all the people who helped us along the way," Gabriel Lopez said. "Yesterday, a good friend I grew up with who is a barber came to my house and cut the kids' hair for me," he said, noting the barber charged only a nominal fee.
Lori Overdorf, the association's director of development and youth services, said the Lopezes are special people.
"The amount of grace, generosity, compassion and patience Gabe and Jeanette have displayed is truly remarkable," Overdorf said. "They took the kids in and, since Day One have only looked out for the kids' best interests, and taken every step possible to keep the kids together as a family unit."
The Valley Community Association is sponsoring the family for Christmas. Last year, a neighbor held a holiday party in which people donated gift cards to the Lopezes.
Still, even with all the help, this time of year is tough, the couple said.
"It's difficult because the bills don't stop because its the holidays," Gabriel Lopez said.
They are also aware that their children – Justice is now 11, Bishop is 7, and Angel is 4 – see other kids getting computers and other gadgets or toys as holiday presents and going on vacation.
"I would love to show them more than Buffalo," Jeanette Lopez said. "We haven't been able to even take them on a vacation ever, and that's our dream, to take them to Disney World.
"They never ask for anything crazy, but we would love to get them stuff that they really want," she said. "But sometimes it's hard to even get food, especially with the fixed income I'm on."
"It is a struggle, but there are a lot of other people who have it worse than we do," Gabriel Lopez said. "We're never ones to just lay down. We are both very hardworking people, and we try to do our best to still try to help other people and do anything we can to not just sit around and live a glass-is-half-empty kind of life," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bakery owner 'devastated' by demolition, says city must police absentee landlords</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As Susan Adamucci drove her 12-year-old son to school last Wednesday, she heard on the radio that a building was in peril in downtown Buffalo.
A short time later she learned the property being torn down included Two Wheels Bakery & Cafe, which she opened in April 2018 as the city's lone fully gluten-free bakery.
Adamucci estimated the overall loss in bakery and restaurant equipment at between $80,000 and $90,000.
"This whole experience has been devastating," Adamucci said. "I have a family. I'm the sole breadwinner in that family, and I put a lot of time and money and energy and love into this venture."
The emergency demolition at 435 Ellicott St. was issued after the roof collapsed inside the 1860s-era, three-story Italianate brick building. Adamucci rushed to the site, but could only watch helplessly knowing her two ovens, double refrigerator and freezer – as well as a ventless hood and an exhaust hood that by themselves cost $39,000 – were irretrievable.
Adamucci, 50, is expecting to find out this week if she will recoup equipment losses from her insurance company. She also plans to sue property owner Bruce Adler of Buffalo Properties Ltd., registered downstate in Nyack, to cover lost income and other losses.
This was the second major structural collapse at the building over the past 3½ months.
Two Wheels Bakery had been closed since Aug. 21, when a chimney crumbled, damaging the roof and causing bricks to fall on the south side of the building.
In addition to Two Wheels, the building had two upstairs apartments that also became uninhabitable that day.
Flying bricks also forced the closure of Puppy Playpen, located in an Adler-owned building next door.
A structural engineering report called for by the city specified the damages in need of repair.
"At that point, the building was definitely salvageable," Adamucci believed. "All Adler needed to do was get the roof done and repair a few rows of bricks."
But no work was done during the 104 days that transpired between the first roof collapse on Aug. 21 and the Dec. 4 emergency demolition triggered by the additional roof damage.
Adler, who owns multiple properties on Ellicott and Oak streets, has a history of housing court violations. But the seven citations written up for 435 Ellicott St. – six filed on Aug. 22, and a seventh on Sept. 4 – failed to make their way to Housing Court Judge Patrick M. Carney during that time period.
Adler, whose insurance claim in August was rejected, could not be reached to comment.
For Adamucci, the demolition capped a difficult period with her landlord that began after she signed a lease in November 2015. Adler failed to reconfigure unsafe basement stairs or put in wooden flooring stipulated in her lease, Adamucci said. She was forced to pay for the work so she withheld rent for a year to compensate, she said.
Adamucci was still determined to make the space work because she felt the location was ideal.
"I wanted to be downtown and easily accessible," Adamucci said, referring to its proximity to the Kensington Expressway. "I loved that it was at the end of the 33 to make it easy for people that were not in the city, or were even a little afraid of the city to come in, too. It also had a beautiful courtyard in the back.
"I also loved the beautiful brick building," she said. "I really felt like the building had been sitting for the most part, but we were going to bring life back to it."
Adamucci suffers from an autoimmune disease, and she opened her gluten-free bakery in April 2018 to be a safe place to eat for people unable to digest gluten. The chocolate cherry and lemon currant scones, red velvet cake, double chocolate cookies and other offerings were meant to appeal to everyone.
"A lot of people who were not gluten-free were coming in for these items," Adamucci said. "That was the concept.  When I hit a recipe and my tester said I can't even tell this is gluten-free, that's when I had a winner."
The growing business and glowing testimonials on social media gave her confidence she had made the right choice.
"We had a phenomenal summer," Adamucci said. "We were showing a lot of growth and were beginning to cover all of our operating costs," she said, noting it can take two years for a restaurant to operate in the black.
But Adamucci said she could not ultimately compensate for the landlord's neglect.
"I was just trying to run my business and make it work,' Adamucci said. "I really felt like I had this horrible landlord but if I just focused on the business and paid my rent then I would be OK. It didn't work out."
Adamucci said she has been deeply moved by the "the support and love" received the last several days. The owners of Feature Eatery, located downtown, have allowed her to use their kitchen so she can keep her wholesale business going, including baking gluten-free pies for Thanksgiving and preparing baked products for Christmas.
"They have allowed us to come into their kitchen twice a week since this happened in August, and they won't let us pay them," Adamucci said. "It makes me want to cry to think about the kindness that they have shown us."
A GoFundMe campaign to help Two Wheels recover can be found at gofundme.com/f/two-wheels-bakery-amp-cafe.
Adamucci has plans to rebound by relocating to not one but two sites.
One would be a retail baking operation she plans to open in early 2020 at a building rented at 1006 Grant St. in Black Rock.
A cafe is also planned on the West Side at the corner of Plymouth and Pennsylvania avenues. She expects to open in the spring with the help of an investor.
Adamucci said she hopes the city will be prodded by what happened to better police out-of-town landlords who don't maintain their properties.
"There's a big hole in this beautiful block," Adamucci said. "People could say it was an old building, but there are tons of buildings that are the same age that are fine.
"I hope the city will now put in place policies to hold commercial landlords responsible for these buildings that are just crumbling," she said. "Imagine if – God forbid  – anyone had gotten hurt that day."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Labor issues could plague long-delayed veterans cemetery project</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON – On top of the delays and cost overruns, the new veterans cemetery being constructed in Pembroke now potentially faces labor trouble.
The Buffalo Building and Construction Trades Council has been pushing for a project labor agreement at the site, meaning the construction contracts would have to go to unionized companies. And the local labor group has a powerful ally: Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer.
But the Department of Veterans Affairs says it's too late to include a project labor agreement at the site.
Paul Brown, the president of the building trades council, isn't happy about that.
"We're going to protest these guys," Brown said last week. "There's no question about it."
Schumer, a New York Democrat who has been the cemetery's most prominent advocate, made the case for organized labor's involvement in the project in a Nov. 19 letter to Veterans Secretary Robert Wilkie.
"Aside from providing work for local Western New Yorkers, a (project labor agreement) provides additional structure, professionalism, productivity and stability to federal construction projects and thus promotes the successful and expeditious completion of construction projects like this one," Schumer wrote.
Wilkie has not yet responded to Schumer's letter, a spokewoman for the senator said.
Brown, meanwhile, pressed that point last week in a meeting with Randy C. Reeves, the VA's undersecretary for memorial affairs, who visited the Pembroke site last week. He said a project labor agreement might be able to save costs – and that it would result in more veterans working on the construction site.
"All this guy kept talking about, this Randy guy, was he wants a place to put veterans in the ground," Brown said. "Well, what about the ones that are above it still? Come on!"
Others, however, are not nearly so thrilled with the idea of requiring union labor on a project that's already at least $10 million over its original budget.
"In my view, it's only going to muddy the water," said Patrick W. Welch, a longtime Buffalo veterans advocate who attended the meeting with Reeves last week.
The contractor on the project – Albert Urban of Global Urban Enterprises of Victor – said during the meeting that he is hiring both union and nonunion subcontractors, but that he's paying the same prevailing union wage to all of them, Welch said. Urban did not return a phone call seeking comment.
What's more, Welch said he feared that requiring union labor might run afoul of a federal law that aims to make sure that such work goes to companies owned by disabled veterans.
Meanwhile, the VA said a project labor agreement could only have been included in the original contract for the project, and that neither bidder proposed including one.
"It is against Federal Acquisition Regulation to add a PLA after the fact," said Les' Melnyk, chief of public affairs and outreach at the VA's National Cemetery Administration. "The request must be made during procurement. In the case of this acquisition, contractors could propose bids with or without a PLA."
Contractors often oppose public labor agreements, fearing they would increase costs – which have already proven to be a huge concern at the veterans cemetery.
The VA broke the Pembroke cemetery project into two phases after the first round of bids for the project came in over the $36 million in federal funding already set aside for the project.
The agency says it needs another $10 million from Congress for the next phase of the project, but in his letter to the VA secretary, Schumer expressed concerns about whether the VA's cost estimates are still off target.
He urged the agency to re-evaluate its cost estimate for the project's next phase using a 12-step process recommended by the Government Accountability Office in a recent report that criticized the VA for cost overruns at veterans cemeteries.
If that additional $10 million isn't enough, Schumer told the VA secretary: "I urge you to include additional funding in the administration's FY21 budget request to address any shortfall revealed by this re-evaluation."
Schumer also asked Wilkie to reconsider the VA's plan to delay the next phase of the project from 2020 to 2022, and to reconsider its decision to remove construction of a perimeter fence and stone wall from its cemetery plans.
Reeves, the VA undersecretary, traveled to Pembroke in part to allay concerns veterans have about the cemetery, which was first proposed more than a decade ago and that has been plagued by delays ever since.
William Joyce, the director of veterans services in Genesee County, said he was pleased with the meeting.
"I feel real confident" that there won't be any more delays or cost overruns, said Joyce, who added that Reeves is "110 percent committed" to the project.
But Welch left the meeting with doubts.
"You know, I'm an accountant by profession and when I asked specific monetary questions, I got a runaround," Welch said.
Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Patrick Welch as the Erie County veterans advocate. He no longer serves in that official capacity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can they really search my phone? Answering your border questions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you live in Western New York, you probably see Canada on the regular. Maybe even every day. The border is a backdrop to our lives, but there’s a lot we don’t know about it. That’s why we launched our series, “The Other Border,” which began in November and wraps up later this month.
Our work on the series took Buffalo News Chief Photographer Derek Gee and me across the border in New York, from the eastern-most portion of the state back to our own region. The stories delve into a range of border topics, from efforts by law enforcement to unearth drugs and other contraband to the journeys of refugees from around the world to what actually happens at a border inspection.
We've received plenty of questions from readers over the last few weeks. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked:
At ports of entry – which include all four passenger bridges in Western New York – quite a lot. Federal law allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to search vehicles and personal items such as luggage, laptop bags and purses as a matter of routine. This can happen for inbound and outbound traffic and does not require a warrant or even a level of suspicion.
Some level of suspicion, however, is required for personal searches that involve pat-downs, partial removal of clothing, or internal X-rays. These types of searches may be used, for example, to find out whether somebody is trying to carry drugs or other contraband across the border.
Yes.
Phones, cameras, computers, tablets and other electronic devices can be searched. Some of those searches have uncovered evidence pertaining to terrorist activity, child pornography, human trafficking, export control and intellectual property rights violations, visa fraud, and the smuggling of drugs, large amounts of cash and people.
But that said, devices are rarely searched – and CBP officials are quick to point that out. When I discussed this question with Chief Officer Aaron Bowker, who is public affairs liaison for the Buffalo Field Office, he provided an official CBP statement to put it in context: “In fiscal year 2019, CBP processed more than 414 million travelers at U.S. ports of entry. During that same period of time, CBP conducted 40,913 border searches of electronic devices, representing less than .01 percent of arriving international travelers.”
Some instances of electronic searches have grabbed a lot of media attention, including in The Buffalo News. They may be a small percentage, but they are sensitive, and CBP officials are precise when speaking of them. Bowker also shared an official statement that notes CBP “has established strict guidelines to ensure that these searches are exercised judiciously, responsibly and consistent with the public trust.”
Here are three ideas:
A consistent theme I’ve noticed since beginning work on this series is this: Border officials from both the United States and Canada focus most intensely on who is entering their country, or already in it. If they notice people leaving, they may give their counterparts across the border a heads up. But they won’t necessarily stop those people – nor, in many cases, can they stop them.
Wade Laughman, patrol agent in charge at U.S. Border Patrol’s Massena Station, gave me an example: “Somebody might be in here on a six-month visa to the United States, and they legally flew in on a visa that’s going to expire in a week,” he said. “(They may think), ‘You know what? I’m going to go to Canada, because it’s either that or I’m going to get deported. I don’t want to be here illegally.’ ”
Border Patrol agents may come across such a group in a place like Massena – or Plattsburgh, or even perhaps Buffalo. If those visas are still valid, then the people are in the United States legally. That can prompt a call from Border Patrol officials to their Canadian counterparts that would go something like this, in Laughman’s words: “Just so you know, these people are still valid in the United States. They’ve got visas; we can’t do anything. But tomorrow they expire, so they’re going to be coming north.”
That northward trek could happen over water, which would be the likely case here in Western New York. Or it could be through the woods or farmland, in the New York’s North Country.
Or it could be in the wide open, at Roxham Road in Champlain, the rural spot about a half-hour from Plattsburgh. That's where tens of thousands of people have crossed illegally from the United States into Quebec over the last three years to claim refugee status in Canada. Roxham is so open, and the crossings so frequent, that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have set up a building on the Quebec side of the border where they process the arrests and then the people ask for asylum.
Anywhere on the border, this dynamic changes when a person or a group is considered to be a threat, or smuggling is involved. Canadian and U.S. officials regularly share intelligence about dangerous individuals or groups, and they work together to clamp down on the smuggling of people and goods. Homeland Security Investigations, which is an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, leads Border Enforcement Security Task Forces that include law enforcement personnel from both countries. We’ll be sharing more about how those BEST teams work in the final two stories in “The Other Border” series.
During my research for this series, I spent time trying to figure out which areas of the border are most sensitive from a national security perspective. The obvious possibility in my mind was the Niagara Power Project in Lewiston. It’s located on the water, a short drive from the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, and clearly under heavy security surveillance.
I posed the question to former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who served under President Barack Obama, and who earlier this year published a book, “How Safe Are We?”
“Big pieces of critical infrastructure, like the Niagara Power Plant, to be successfully attacked would require more than one person,” she said. “It would require a group of people.” Napolitano was drawing a contrast to single shooters attacking soft targets like schools, churches and concert venues. “It’s much different than something that’s susceptible to a lone-wolf shooter,” she said, “like that happened in Parkland or like happened in Las Vegas or so forth. It’s just a different dimension.”
Whereas lone shooters may slip undetected into a less-guarded site, a group of people equipped with guns and explosives and aiming to attack a hard target are more prone to be caught. There are more people, and more elements to coordinate, and therefore more ways to stop it.
“That’s why I say that our relations with Canada and Canadian law enforcement are so important,” Napolitano said, “because when you have a conspiracy, then you have the opportunity to detect that conspiracy ahead of time, to intervene, and to prevent.”
What worries Napolitano about the United States’ critical infrastructure is cybersecurity. In her book, she cites it as one of the top three risks facing the United States.
“All of these power plants are networked,” she said. “Our banking system is networked. Our water systems are networked. They’re all susceptible to hacking, or to interference in operations through their cyber networks.”
That’s a risk that comes with no borders.

There are many ethnicities of Asian people across the world including Malays, Chinese, Indians, Thais, Vietnamese, Japanese and so forth. With these variations also come different practices but one culture stands strong as the one thing all Asians do. They don’t wear shoes in their homes.
Hence, it’s only normal for guests who visit Asian households to remove their shoes along with their hosts as a sign of understanding and respect for their culture, right?
Right.
But one woman named Margaret has decided that it’s rude for those who have implemented this culture into their households to have their guests adhere to the same rules. She even went so far as to write an article titled ‘I Think It’s Rude To Ask Guests To Take Off Their Shoes – Here’s Why‘, about a year ago. And get this. Her reason as to why it’s rude?
Because her outfit would not look complete without her shoes.
Now, the article has resurfaced and is making its rounds online – and Asians are not having it. Here are just some of their responses.
And the best part, not only is removing your shoes before entering a home an Asian thing, but other cultures from around the globe have adopted the practice and are also giving Margaret a piece of their mind.
Hence, Margaret; if you’re reading this, many around the world are now practising the no-shoe policy in their households and it’s only normal for guests to understand and follow along. In fact, it’s rude if you don’t.
And if you can’t accept that, then be prepared for your own guests to track in mud, dirt, dog poop and whatever else they probably stepped on, on their way to your home.
You’ll understand when it happens to you and you’re left to sweep, mop and clean up the filth that’s left behind once everyone leaves.
Rude.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTube unveils top Indian ads watched in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
Google India recently announced its annual YouTube advertisement leaderboard for India, which highlighted the ads that have received the maximum views and shares from audiences across the country.
While Kia Motor's ad for its Seltos triggering design creativity bagged some 232 million views, Samsung India's campaign for its Good Vibes struck a chord with netizens garnering over 205 million views.
Chinese handset maker Oppo's ad spot for its F11 pro model bagged over 96 million views, while a television commercial by Xiaomi India about Mi TV brand registered over 133 million views.
Given the huge number of electronic and mobile brands that have made it to the top rank, BusinessLine reached out to Satya Raghavan, Director - YouTube Partnerships, India, to know what the trend revealed about consumption patterns across the country.
"YouTube’s year-end ads leaderboard is a reflection and true representation of the year’s biggest campaigns," said Raghavan. “With the growing reach and highly engaged audience, YouTube today is a preferred launch platform for brands. This is reflected in the leaderboard with Kia motors and many of the new mobile phone brands,” he said.
Noting that while advertisers have always preferred YouTube for long form ads, Raghavan said brands are also tapping into YouTube Blast that offers "unparalleled reach with relevant audience in minimum time and eventually provides higher impact."
As for helping brands reach out to consumers in today's cluttered marketplace, Raghavan clarified, “Viewers don’t come to YouTube for distraction, they come to engage. According to an independent study commissioned by Ipsos, 85 per cent of our subscribers watch new videos from their favourite creators within two days. And, that engagement also applies to ads. More than 95 per cent of YouTube ads are viewable, the highest rate in the industry," he added.
Samsung India created a campaign for its Good Vibes app which helps deaf and blind people communicate with others. Made by advertising agency Cheil, the campaign tells the story of a young deaf and blind girl who uses the Good Vibes app to reach out to her family. The ad bagged the second spot on the leaderboard.
Another television commercial by Xiaomi India highlighted smart features of its Mi TV brand, specifically the voice command capability powered by Google Assistant. The brand leveraged the on screen chemistry of actors Sumeet Raghavan and Rupali Ganguly, aka comedy show series Sarabhai versus Sarabhai fame. This ad bagged the fourth spot on the leaderboard.
Chinese handset maker Oppo's ad spot for its F11 pro model was about key features and sleek design and bagged the fifth highest viewership.
At the seventh spot on the leaderboard is Aditya Birla Group's 'Big in your life' campaign which showcases the company’s journey of a brand that reached out to and empowers people at every stage in their life.
Given the massive depth and diversity of content on the platform, brands have leveraged YouTube to tell some of the year’s most compelling brand stories, the best of which form the YouTube ads leaderboard for 2019.
The list represents the top 10 ads on YouTube in India that resonated most with audiences and celebrates the brands that performed best through a combination of popularity and promotion.
Over the years, video have gone mainstream with YouTube-- now reaching 265 million monthly active users as per ComScore 2019 (April), making it a go-to destination for brands. They have innovatively capitalised on YouTube’s popularity by creating engaging ads, says the official.
Over the last two years, the company has launched several ad products – Bumpers, Director Mix, TrueView, Video Ads Sequencing and YouTube Blast, being the newest tool. "These products are designed to ensure that YouTube is the perfect platform for both brand and performance advertisers," said Raghavan.
Citing an example, he added, with formats such as TrueView for Action, advertisers can create ads with interactive functionality. "This has been a huge success for performance advertisers looking to optimise video for a specific user action, like signing up for a service or buying a product," he added.
Speaking about leads and referrals, Raghavan added though YouTube is driving brand awareness and consideration, with TrueView for Action the firm can now offer a full funnel solution to drive results both online and offline.
"You can use video ads to drive any action on your website that’s important to your business, for example, leads or referrals. While driving online action is important, offline action is also crucial for driving business results and marketers across the board are tapping into this to drive business results," said Raghavan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">National e-commerce policy to lay down terms for treatment of non-personal, commercial data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The new e-commerce policy being drafted by the government is likely to lay down how non-personal data such as commercial data held by e-commerce companies, anonymised data and community data are to be treated in terms of their location and processing.
“We have started stakeholder consultations on how to treat non-personal data. It is a highly sensitive matter as different stakeholders have different views on it. For instance, Nasscom has its set of opinions, while industry body CII has its own views. There are also various studies done on the subject. All these will be examined one by one," Guruprasad Mohapatra, Secretary, Department of Policy for Industry and Internal Trade told BusinessLine.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), while working on the Personal Data Bill, had made a separate committee comprising IT experts and officials from key Ministries to look at whether there should be a free flow of non-personal and anonymised data across borders or it should be localised.
While the Personal Data Bill 2018 was recently cleared by the Union Cabinet and will soon be placed before Parliament, a number of loose ends still need to be tied for non-personal data.
“We will try to see that the e-commerce policy is finalised soon. This (treatment of non-personal data) is the only sensitivity which has to be worked out,” Mohapatra said.
Multinational corporations such as Amazon, Uber and Google hold a lot of anonymised data in India that are commercial in nature and most want to store the data outside the country and also process it there. The US government, too, has been lobbying hard with India for a free flow of data.
Many in the domestic industry, however, argue that localising data will not only ensure absolute security of data but also create jobs within the country as domestic servers have to be used for storing it.
As per the draft Personal Data Protection Bill approved by the Cabinet, personal data classified as sensitive such as information on financial matters, sexual orientation, health, biometrics, genetics, transgender status and religious or political beliefs and affiliation cannot be stored by public and private entities outside the country but can be processed outside with the consent of the data person.
Critical personal data, to be defined from time to time by the government but mostly related to security and defence matters, will have to be mandatorily processed and stored in the country. However, general data, which will fall outside the purview of sensitive and critical, can be both processed and stored outside the country.
In June this year, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said that an institutional framework would be put in place to bring out a national e-commerce policy within twelve months. He also said that India wanted to engage with the world on data and e-commerce issues, but there has to be reciprocity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No threat of job losses in auto sector: Minister tells RS</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is no threat of job losses in the automobile sector and no reason for worry, Minister of State for Heavy Industries Arjun Ram Meghwal said in Rajya Sabha on Monday.
“The automobile sector is presently in a transitional phase where it has to migrate to BS VI from BS IV by April 1, 2020, the deadline given by the Supreme Court. We also have to move towards electric vehicles,” he said during Question Hour.
“Therefore, the worry (over job losses) that has been expressed, this is a recycle. There is no reason to worry. No jobs are in danger and the government has taken all required measures for improvement after speaking to stakeholders,” he said.
In a written reply, Union Heavy Industries Minister Prakash Javadekar said no closure of any automobile or ancillary manufacturing units has been reported in the past three years.
Passenger vehicle sales in India rose marginally in October aided by positive festive season sentiment and introduction of new models in utility vehicle space, just about managing to snap 11 continuous months of decline in sales, according to figures released last month by auto industry body SIAM.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Loose Buttons – “Fell Into A Hole” (Feat. Forth Wanderers’ Ava Trilling)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I promise this isn’t supposed to be an insult: The members of NYC quartet Loose Buttons were toddlers when Is This It came out, but they remind me of one of those post-Strokes bubblegum rock bands that would jockey for placement in O.C. episodes and iPod commercials. They are kids playing a cleaned-up and ultra-catchy version of hip downtown rock ‘n’ roll, like Phantom Planet fronted by a young, winsomely sneering Alex Turner. I like it!
Not long ago Loose Buttons shared the title track from their debut album Something Better. Today they’ve got another single out. The new one, “Fell Into A Hole,” is a bit like Tokyo Police Club doing their best to evoke “Left Of The Dial.” It features guest vocals from Ava Trilling of Forth Wanderers fame. The bridge has big Julian Casablancas energy, and the ending even kind of disappears into a void.
Singer Eric Nizgretsky has this to say:

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 10 Best Country Albums Of 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you ask Twitter — or your teenage nephew in Los Angeles — the story of country music in 2019 was Lil Nas X and “Old Town Road,” the song that became infamous both for breaking chart records and being booted off one, too. For those outside of the sphere of Nashville, the trajectory of the TikTok star embodied everything they needed to know about the genre’s seemingly exclusionary, insular world, where Lil Nas X couldn’t be accepted as “country” even with Billy Ray Cyrus in tow. It was a good scapegoat for the outside world to once again hone in on Nashville’s myopia, warranted or not.
But as fun a story (and a bop) as “Old Town Road” is, it’s not truly the picture of country music in 2019, a year rich with developments both bold and subtle, and with so many great albums that collecting only 10 is a near impossible feat. “Old Town Road” wasn’t the most captivating country moment, and it wasn’t even it’s most interesting cross collaboration: Maren Morris’ year, for one, saw her funneling the steam of a massive pop hit, “The Middle,” into her sophomore album GIRL and then taking a hard left turn into the Highwomen, where she harmonized on pure country songs alongside Amanda Shires, a brilliant artist much more known to the Americana and indie rock worlds. This, truly, is where things really got interesting and fruitful, breaking down lines not just between genres but also within them, and the boundaries we’re supposed to accept.
Country music — always in that battle between mainstream (radio-friendly) output and the independent world — took many steps like this towards a new era where collaboration, and cross-pollination, meant something different. Luke Combs, arguably the biggest mainstream breakout in country in the past two years, played at Willie Nelson’s ranch (and made a good album too). Tyler Childers signed a major record deal and snagged a Grammy. Artists like Midland and Jon Pardi embraced country so twangy and traditional it’s almost more Americana than country radio.
Brandi Carlile became an omnipresent force: as a part of the Highwomen, on Maren Morris and Zac Brown’s albums, and co-producing Tanya Tucker’s triumphant return, While I’m Livin’. So universally beloved and so genuinely good — both in heart and in talent — Carlile’s almost becoming the Dolly Parton heir apparent. (Just look at Newport Folk Festival this past summer, where they sang together.) A leader for the genre who is openly lesbian, dedicated to charity work, speaks her mind freely, and still snags an invite to the CMAs? Yeah, sign us up for that future.
Country radio aside, the genre’s as rich and interesting as it’s ever been, particularly from its independent voices: That scene birthed excellent records from Kelsey Waldon, Michaela Anne, Caroline Spence, Erin Enderlin, Emily Scott Robinson, Dori Freeman, Ian Noe, Kelleigh Bannen, Kalie Shorr, Gabe Lee, Charles Wesley Godwin and many more from Texas to Canada to New York and back. It bred fantastic EPs, too, from Hailey Whitters, Charlie Marie, and Ruston Kelly. Some blended in singer-songwriter approaches, some were deeply traditional, some conjured up emo influences that worked shockingly well with the direct nature of country lyricism. (Kelly’s cover of Dashboard Confessional’s “Screaming Infidelities” is a gift).
The best albums this year, though, proved just how diverse the palate of country music can be, even when it exists well within genre walls. They toyed with expectations and rules: with how country is supposed to sound, how teams are supposed to only play amongst themselves, of the narratives that the genre is supposed to tell. They elevated women’s stories, stories of Appalachia and rural America, of love from all angles and the boundaries of who gets to participate in the genre to begin with. But, most of all, they told the truth.
Kalie Shorr could easily become a pop sensation if she wanted to. She understands the dynamics of hooks, how to connect with a fanbase, and pure saccharine fun just as good as the best. But she’s too damn honest, too damn country for that game. “I’ve never been worse, thanks for asking,” she sings on the first track of Open Book, “Too Much To Say,” which is the answer song to any “how are you” question that never really expected an answer, or wanted to hear it if it came. But you want to listen to Shorr — singing about pain and drug addiction and loss and sex in such a no-bullshit way that it never feels like you’re being asked to carry her emotional baggage — you’re just invited to drop yours along too. Country music needs this kind of fire.

It’s so hard to pigeonhole Michaela Anne — there’s a strong singer-songwriter thread, a well-versed instrumentalist, an Americana faithful, and a true lover ’90s greats (Shania Twain, for one). It gives her a perspective so uniquely her own on Desert Dove, an album that paints a story of a life lived on her own terms (“By Our Design,” a song sure to spark your own longing for a personal rulebook), of a woman who won’t take any of your shit (“If I Wanted Your Opinion”), and of the importance of being kind to those that are suffering (“Be Easy”). Anne’s vocals make the lessons go down easily, and her writing makes them impossible to forget.

“There’s nothing that I cannot do with a double latte and dry shampoo,” sings Emily Scott Robinson on one of Traveling Mercies’ lighter moments, “White Hot Country Mess.” It’s a universal truth, though, that feeling of making it through anything with a little push of caffeine and some no-shower cover. That’s what Robinson continually captures perfectly: monogamy that gets better over time (“The way we fight a little less now,” she sings on “Better With Time,” “make love a little more”), the toil of going town to town, just trying to make a living on “Borrowed Rooms And Old Wood Floors,” the hopelessness of working to win back someone who will never return the feeling (“Pie Song”). The album’s centerpiece is “The Dress,” a song that encompasses the impossibly complex mix of emotions that linger in the mind of a rape survivor in one brilliantly haunting line: “Was it the dress I wore?” she asks. No sexual assault is ever the fault of the victim, but that carried guilt, that shame, that self-blame is as heavy a weight on the shoulders as anything.

It’s the anthem we knew we needed but had not yet been delivered: “GIRL,” the title track from Maren Morris’ second LP, became a rallying cry for every woman in 2019 who felt under-appreciated, over-compared, run down, and discouraged. That’s the kind of inertia that starts GIRL, with a whole load of permission for both the audience and Morris herself to take a ride free of judgment.
That’s how Morris operates, too, when she’s making music. She has a rich ear for a country lyric (“We took a hard left, but we’re all right”), a huge grasp of a hopelessly fun melodies, and a fearlessness when it comes to never landing her songs in one box or another. Co-produced with the late Busbee, GIRL bucks any and all conventions, with Morris singing about bridging political divides and recruiting Carlile for a duet on “Common,” getting sultry as hell on “RSVP,” and writing a classic ode to keeping a relationship strong on “The Bones.” Coupled with her work with the Highwomen, she’s one of the most versatile artists in any genre, let alone country.

Tyler Childers’ follow-up to his breakthrough debut, Purgatory, came with little surprises for his devoted fans. That’s because every single song of Country Squire was worked out and played on the road, tested and developed in front of real, live humans. For that reason, it’s almost easy to take its greatness for granted — but that would be a damn shame. In nine tight country-ass tracks, written to precision, Childers sings of passion and small town life and remaining devoted on the road — sure, “Ever Lovin’ Hand” is about masturbation, but it’s really about the struggle to stay true to the ones we love — in his high-lonesome howl, so young and so aged all at once. And it’s wonderful to hear Childers, who is so strongly connected with that classic country, mountain sound, show that there’s not much of a line between Motown ballads of adoration and his own point of view on “All Your’n.”

John Prine’s label, Oh Boy, hadn’t signed anyone in 15 years when it announced it would be adding Kelsey Waldon to its roster. Those who had never heard of the Nashville-based, Kentucky-born Waldon figured this had to be something good: You don’t wait a decade and a half for mediocre. And those who had been listening to Waldon for years knew something even more certain: That it was about damn time someone snagged her. Waldon writes with detail and humanity, thoroughly connected to the roots of the genre, and her own roots, but always moving forward. Songs like “Kentucky, 1988″ tell her story so vibrantly you can see the knotty pines, the aging trailer and the plains, and feel the struggle of trying to love a father for all his imperfections. White Noise/White Lines is a fully realized album, flowing like one long journey into what keeps Waldon up at night, and what made her who she is.

Addiction, checkered pasts, personal struggle — for the men of country music, specifically the “outlaws,” those are the things that build “character,” a story of redemption or edginess or authenticity or however you want to fold it. For women, particularly older women, though, those things are often career-ending. It’s the same formula that had many dismissing Tanya Tucker for good, a singer so influential that she’s shaped everyone from Miranda Lambert to Margo Price to Brandi Carlile — the latter of whom teamed up with Shooter Jennings to producer Tucker’s new album, While I’m Livin’. There’s no album from a “veteran” of the genre that sounds so fresh this year, maybe even this decade. From the mischievous boogie of “Hard Luck” to the priceless lessons of “Bring My Flowers Now,” it feels like Tucker’s just getting started — again.

Many artists before have tried their hands at country-soul, but no one’s done it quite like Yola, who hails from Bristol, England and not the American south. It takes approximately one minute into her debut LP, the Dan Auerbach-produced Walk Through Fire, to know that this is no usual songwriter, and no usual voice. That song is “Faraway Look,” which has now been nominated for a Grammy and bursts with longing, passion, and a goose bump-inducing wall of sound. Only Yola can pack all of this superhuman stuff into a track that also reminds you she’s very human — lyrics like “Nobody moves the way you do, walking ’round the grocery store” shoot you so directly back into everyday life, it’s nearly unsettling — or take a retro spin through heartbreak on “Ride Out In The Country.” There’s no more exciting new Americana artist out there, full stop.

“Is happiness on the highway,” sings Miranda Lambert on “Settling Down,” “Or is it parked in the driveway?” No one can pack as much into a simple phrase as Lambert, nor sing so personally about things so universal. On Wildcard, her first album produced by Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Brothers Osborne), Lambert’s digging deep into her own very human conflicts. How do you choose love, when you love the road? How do you change when everyone knows your history? (Answer: You wash that shit out with a Tide Stick.) How do you honor the roots of country music while continually expanding your worldview, the way an artist should?
Lambert works through all of these on Wildcard, ending up with some of the most potent country songs of the year (“Bluebird,” “How Dare You Love”) while also having plenty of fun, too. And just when you think you know Lambert, she throws a curveball: There’s nothing as thirst-quenching as hearing her take those world-class vocals all gritty on the country gospel “Holy Water.” It makes you want to sin just so you can take a sip.

When news broke that Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris, Natalie Hemby, and Amanda Shires would be forming a project together, the internet dissolved into a near panic. When? Where? How? There have been country supergroups before — the Highwaymen, of course, and on to Pistol Annies and beyond — but this was something different. A movement meant to directly confront country radio with women’s stories, stories rarely heard on the airwaves in a sea of beer songs.
Part of the joy of the Highwomen is how selfless it felt in nature: Morris, one of the few female country artists who actually gets spins, taking attention and time away from her solo career to make an album that includes a lesbian love long? Shires, who released such an excellent, very non-country album To The Sunset last year, pivoting back to her roots for the sake of equality? Word-class writer Hemby, who could probably cook up 10 number-one hits in a day if she wanted, digging so deep and personal it’s hard to listen to her words without crying? And Carlile, on the crest of a career tidal wave, making her next move out of Grammy glory a battle for the unheard? Even Jason Isbell happily agreed to noodle away in the background, and out of the limelight. The Highwomen didn’t just feel like a group gathering. It felt like a calling.
All that powerful stuff aside, it’s the music that matters most. A key element here is empathy. Right out of the gate, their stunning rewrite of the classic Highwaymen anthem isn’t just Johnny Cash riding around inexplicably on a spaceship, it’s stories of the forgotten women who died in sacrifice for others, for her children, for human rights, for her neighbor. There’s empathy in songs like “My Name Can’t Be Mama Today,” a raucous slice of truth in a world of mombloggers painting parenting as constant perfection — this one gives permission to say it’s OK to, just for a minute, dream of not having that extra mouth to feed or bed to make. There’s empathy in “My Only Child,” Hemby’s gut-wrenchingly honest tribute to both great disappointment and great, great love, where Shires’ fiddle cries gorgeously on her shoulder. There’s empathy for the aging, in Shires’ exquisite “Cocktail And A Song,” and for those who live on after loss.
But there’s deep, deep power too. Power in “Redesigning Women,” the band’s radio single that hits on every corner of the modern woman (is there a better feminist rallying cry than “Some of us are saints and some of us are surgeons?”), power in the unity of “Crowded Table,” in Morris’ kiss-off “Loose Change,” in “Wheels Of Laredo,” a classic being made in real time. And there’s power in these voices: Morris’ unparalleled and raw riffing at the end of “Old Soul,” Shires’ Parton-like warble intimate and warm, Hemby’s mournful howl for the child she never had on “My Only Child,” and Carlile, who can sing literally anything better than, well, anyone, using her spotlight moments to transmit twangy country passion on “If She Ever Leaves Me.”
Some critics took issue with the group’s unison singing, but, in truth, it actually works perfectly. Democracy’s the point, and anyone can chant along here. Sure, this foursome could tackle the most complex of harmonies, but then these couldn’t be sung around campfires, couldn’t rotate different ranges and tones with ease. It makes the “sound” of the Highwomen more important, and more accessible, than any of the individual parts. (It sure helps, though, when the individual parts are extraordinary.) And it makes it able to live forever, in the voices of anyone who joins along. These songs will.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vicki Cornell, the widow of the late Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, is suing the surviving members of Soundgarden. TMZ reports that Vicky Cornell has filed legal documents claiming that her husband’s bandmates are withholding thousands of dollars in owed royalties and disputing the rights to seven unreleased songs.
In the legal documents, Vicky claims that these seven songs were “solely authored by Chris; contain Chris’ own vocal tracks; and were bequeathed to Chris’ Estate.” She wants to release the songs, and she says that she’s offered to share the recordings with Soundgarden. She would like to finish the releases in a way that Chris would have wanted, and she claims that the band has refused. The documents call Soundgarden’s refusal an “unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris’ Estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away.”
Vicky also claims that Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil has falsely claimed that she, Vicky, is the main obstacle to the release of a final Soundgarden album, which misleads Soundgarden’s “loyal, rabid fan base.” According to TMZ, the band disputes the claim that Chris Cornell worked on all seven songs solo. They say that they were working on the song files collaboratively and that Soundgarden members are attempting to claim co-writing credits on five of the seven songs.
Chris Cornell died by suicide in 2017 in a Detroit hotel room; he’d performed with Soundgarden in the city earlier that night. Cornell’s family has already sued Cornell’s doctor, claiming that the doctor overprescribed drugs to Cornell.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lizzo – “Good As Hell” Video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Right now, Lizzo is enjoying one of the weirdest pop-star breakout years I have ever witnessed. Months ago, Lizzo released her much-hyped major-label album Cuz I Love You, which was specifically engineered to turn her into a major figure. It didn’t happen. Instead, the two-year-old song “Truth Hurts” caught fire after showing up in a Netflix romantic comedy, finally ascending to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 later in the year. And now something similar seems likely to happen with an even older Lizzo song.
Lizzo first recorded the breezy empowerment jam “Good As Hell” for the soundtrack of the 2016 movie Barbershop: The Next Cut. Since then, it’s been in a whole lot of soundtracks: A Bad Moms Christmas, Blockers, I Feel Pretty, Brittany Runs A Marathon. In the wake of “Truth Hurts,” the song started to get its own streaming traction, and Lizzo’s label Atlantic started giving it a push. Ariana Grande appeared on a “Good As Hell” remix last month. And now, with “Good As Hell” sitting at #3 on the Hot 100, we’re getting a new music video, seemingly intended to push it over the top.
“Good As Hell” already had a music video, but the new one is glitzier and not at all related to the movie Barbershop: The Next Cut. In the clip, we see Lizzo practicing and performing with the marching band and the dancers from Southern University, the Baton Rouge HBCU. Lizzo herself started playing flute in marching band in eighth grade, and she went on to study flute at the University Of Houston, so the whole HBCU tradition is important to her. Check out the video below.
“Good As Hell” and “Truth Hurts” have both been added to deluxe editions of Cuz I Love You, and they’re out now on Atlantic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Kanye West debuted the new original opera Mary at the Miami Marine Stadium on Sunday, 8 December while covering his body in silver.
The opera, directed by Vanessa Beecroft, follows on the heels of Nebuchadnezzar, Kanye's first opera, which premiered last month at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.
For the rapper, the opera is a new medium through which to express his commitment to faith and his ever-expanding musical and visual palette according to a statement released to the press.
Mary is an original opera, based on the biblical story of the miraculous events surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ. The Books of Matthew and Luke recount the story of Mary, who was divinely chosen by God to bring forth the Messiah. 
Mary brings together elements from different worlds - including opera, fine art, modern dance, and gospel music - to create a new visual interpretation and innovative performance structure. The stage production is performed by the Sunday Service collective, a ministry formed in January of 2019, in collaboration with Access Opera.
With the Sunday Service Collective working alongside a cast of professional opera singers, Mary represents an innovative interpretation of Kanye's own music, gospel standards, and traditional opera alike.

The poll gives 35 seats to Blue&White, and 34 to Likud.
The Joint Arab List holds on to its 13 seats.
Both United Torah Judaism and Shas get 8 seats each.
Avigdor Liberman’s Israel Beiteinu is clipped down by one seat to 7.
A Naftali Bennett-Ayelet Shaked New Right party gets 6 seats – up from 3.
Labor-Gesher goes down to 5 seats from its current 6.
The Democratic camp (Meretz) is also down by a seat, from 5 to 4.
Both Habayit Hayehudi and Otzma Yehudit disappear from the political map – Habayit Hayehudi loses its current 4 seats and falls below the threshold vote.
The left-center bloc remains, according to the survey results, at its current size of 44 seats.
The rightwing bloc is strengthened by one mandate and rises to 56 at the expense of Israel Beiteinu.
In response to the question whom they would prefer as the next prime minister, 41% of respondents preferred Benjamin Netanyahu, with Benny Gantz trailing with 38%, within the margin of error.
Interestingly, according to the survey, 17% of Blue&White voters prefer Gideon Sa’ar over Gantz for prime minister.
The survey was conducted on Sunday, with 556 respondents selected out of 1,271 who were asked to participate online. The margin of error was +-4.3%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Pep Guardiola did after Man Utd ace Fred received alleged racist abuse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Man City boss Pep Guardiola reportedly tracked down Fred after the Man Utd star appeared to be racially abused during Saturday’s clash.
Live footage of the game appeared to show a City fan direct a racist gesture towards the Brazilian midfielder, something that he has since denied, as per the Sun, as he has blasted accusations of being racist and making any racist gestures.

However, as noted by The Sun, he was arrested as a result and the FA are expected to launch an investigation and so time will tell what conclusion is reached on the matter.
The report does go on to note that Guardiola showed his class by tracking down Fred by the tunnel after the game to offer some words of comfort while City officials were also in discussions with their counterparts too as they are said to have insisted that they will deal with the issue.
While it’s obviously not a gesture that will gloss over the incident, it’s one that will perhaps have been appreciated by Fred and it will be reassuring for all concerned to know that the relevant steps will be taken to address the incident rather than try to sweep it under the rug.
In turn, if accurate, it’s a nice touch from Guardiola, while also perhaps confirming that the Man City camp were well aware of the incident almost immediately.
As noted in the report above though, the 41-year-old fan in question has denied that he was being racist, and so it remains to be seen what the outcome is both in terms of the police and FA investigations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AC Milan hold meeting with Barcelona as they consider swoop for €10m-rated starlet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AC Milan officials reportedly met with their Barcelona counterparts on Friday as they line up a potential bid for defender Jean-Clair Todibo.
The 19-year-old joined the Catalan giants in January earlier this year, but since arriving at the Nou Camp he has struggled to secure regular playing time.
After making just two appearances in La Liga in the second half of the last campaign, he has been limited to just two more additional outings so far this season.
With Samuel Umtiti recovering from injury to take his place above the youngster in the pecking order to challenge Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet for a starting berth under coach Ernesto Valverde, it’s questionable as to whether Todibo’s situation will change any time soon.
In turn, perhaps an exit could be the ideal solution for all parties, and now Calciomercato, via the paper edition of Sport, suggest that Milan technical director Paolo Maldini met with Barcelona officials in Milan last Friday to discuss Todibo.
It’s added that the Frenchman is valued at around €10m, and that Barca want to include a buy-back clause in the deal in the event he goes on to establish himself as a top player and fulfils his potential.
Time will tell if that’s a deal that Milan are willing to do, as while Mattia Caldara is closing in on a return after an injury nightmare since joining the club, summer signing Leo Duarte suffered a serious setback at the end of last month.
With that in mind, perhaps coach Stefano Pioli needs more in that department, although given that they’ve struggled at the other end of the pitch for the most part so far this season having scored just 16 goals in 15 league games, the defence is arguably not the main priority.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Strictly's Bruno Tonioli 'reshoots' line over fears he would offend the audience</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the final three couples announced for the Strictly Come Dancing Grand Final next week, there was heartbreak when comedian Chris Ramsey and his pro partner Karen Hauer were eliminated from this weekend's semi-final.
But during last night's results show (8.12.19), judge Bruno Tonioli had to stop and reshoot a line because he feared he would offend the audience.

Chris and Karen - along with Karim Zeroual and his partner Amy Dowden - competed in the dance-off.
As Chris and Karen prepared to re-dance the rumba, The Sun reports that Bruno offered some advice: "It’s not over until the fat lady sings," he said.
But he reportedly asked for a re-shoot, saying: "Oh, I can’t say that any more. You can’t say ‘fat’ on TV."
The publication quotes a source as saying: "Bruno is just conscious about offending people.
"It’s the last thing he’d want to do so it’s better just to be safe.
"The BBC are incredibly sensitive right now. Obviously it’s filtering down to its stars. The audience didn’t have any issue but accepted it’s the new world we’re living in."
ED! has contacted the BBC for comment.

Unfortunately for Chris, 33, the judges unanimously voted to keep Karim and Amy and send them into next week's final.
Already there was EastEnders' Emma Barton and her pro partner Anton Du Beke - making only his second final in 15 years - and ex-Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher and his partner, Oti Mabuse.
Paying tribute to his partner Karen, Chris said: "I'm very proud of myself. I had genuinely no expectations. I thought I'd be gone by week two.
"I've got to thank [Karen]... she's amazing, the best teacher. She's so good at her job, and so patient. So patient!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity: Roman Kemp breaks down watching message from Mum and Dad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An emotional Roman Kemp welled up during I'm A Celebrity's final Extra Camp of the 2019 series as his parents Martin Kemp and Shirlie Holliman paid a loving tribute to their darling son.
Singing star Martin, 58, hailed Roman’s efforts on the ITV jungle reality show as ‘the best television experience’ of his life in a touching moment that left third-placed Roman smiling but overwhelmed.
The Capital Radio DJ put his fist in front of his mouth as he became choked up during his folks' brief address in a short video on the ITV2 spin-off show, with runner up Andy Whyment immediately giving him a hug as Roman took it all in.
"Listen, Ro - we are so proud of you. You have made us laugh, cry. You've just been incredible," his mum began, as both she and Martin beamed with pride.

Spandau Ballet star Martin continued: "You’ve given us such anxiety, too - I can’t tell you. It has been the best television experience of my life."
"We love you so much, Ro. And we can’t wait to see you," added Shirlie.
And as they signed off and Martin raised a hand to salute his son, he added: "Love you, big boy."
On Twitter, Martin had championed his son’s drive for votes to win on Instagram and Twitter throughout Sunday by sharing two heartwarming videos showing Roman as a young boy.

"Congratulations @romankemp so so proud of you!!!" he wrote.
"And thank you so much to EVERYONE who voted for him!!!!"
And after Roman's bronze medal position was confirmed, he made it clear how made up he was for his lad, also thanking fans for their dedicated support.
Talking to Ant and Dec following his departure from the camp, Roman said his stint in the jungle Down Under had been the most moving time he has ever known.
He said: "I’ve never had more fun, I’ve never had so much emotion in my life.
"And it’s a really strange place down there, it’s a really unnatural thing that forms a family within three weeks."
His last day in camp saw him take on his personal biggest fear - which, along with a water-based trial, he had been dreading his entire stay on the show - as he endured the Panic Pit Bushtucker trial.
Buried in an underground chamber, Roman shared the confined space with nearly 60 snakes for ten minutes to win stars for three puddings and a drink as Queen of the Jungle Jac Jossa, Andy and he enjoyed a final slap up meal.
"That was absolutely terrifying," he admitted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Govt to recruit over 500 health workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joyce Moriku Kaducu, the state minister for primary healthcare, says the ministry has been understaffed
The Government is set to recruit 523 health workers to fill vacant positions at various regional referral hospitals and the health ministry.
The health facilities expecting new staff include the Uganda Virus Research Institute and regional referral hospitals of Moroto, Hoima, Kabale and Mubende, as well as the ministry headquarters.
The Health Service Commission has placed adverts inviting applicants to fill the vacant positions.
The applicants are required to submit their applications online at www.hscers.ug to the secretary of the Health Service Commission, not later than January 3.
The commission said it is seeking to recruit senior consultants (general surgery and internal medicine) and consultants (obstetrics, gynaecology, ENT and ophthalmology), among others.
At the health ministry headquarters, the commission has advertised 132 positions for commissioners, assistant commissioners, directors, senior research officers, senior nutritionists, principal health economist, clinical officers and engineers, among others.
In 2017, the Government started redeploying retired senior health specialists in various government-aided health facilities, in a move to boost health service delivery.
Joyce Moriku Kaducu, the state minister for primary healthcare, said the ministry has been understaffed.
She said the move to recruit senior health workers will enable the ministry to fill staffing gaps, especially at consultancy level.
“We need consultants and senior doctors to supervise our young doctors, especially the interns. Most of our consultants left because of the poor pay. So, it is these gaps that the health service commission is trying to fill,” Kaducu told New Vision in a phone interview, on Sunday.
About the pay, Kaducu said salaries for senior health workers, among others, had been increased.
At the start of this financial year, the Government increased pay for health workers, including district health officers, assistant district health officers, specialised medical officers, dental surgeons, pharmacists, consultants, senior consultants, directors referral hospitals, assistant commissioners, commissioners, directors and the director-general of health services.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young celebrity started singing as the judicial officers enjoyed his thrilling music despite being composed in Luganda.
Celebrity power on Friday swept judicial officers and support staff off their feet. This was when seven-year-old Patrick Senyonjo aka fresh kid performed at the judiciary end of year party.
When the master of ceremony mentioned the name fresh kid, most of the judicial officers and their support staff who had gathered at the high court gardens in Kampala for their end of year party stood up.
Some of them pulled out their smartphones and started filming as Fresh Kid advanced to the stage.
The young celebrity started singing as the judicial officers enjoyed his thrilling music despite being composed in Luganda.
Chief Justice Bart Katureebe, Deputy Chief Justice Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, retiring Principal Judge Dr Yorokamu Bamwiine, Justice and Constitutional minister Maj Gen. (rtd) Kahinda Otafiire, Secretary to judiciary Pius Bigirimana and Out-going Chief Registrar Esta Nambayo were visibly amused with Fresh Kid’s music.
 Bamwine was also seen dancing as the young star entertained the judicial officers.
They gave him thunderous claps and later took turns to shake his hand.
A number of judicial officers were seen taking selfies with the young teenager.
Katureebe lauded Fresh Kid and implored him to balance talent with education in order to be successful.
 
Bigirimana revealed that he got to know Fresh kid last year when he was a permanent secretary in the ministry of gender and vowed to help him realise the dream of becoming a permanent secretary.
“When I met him at the Ministry of Gender, I found that he was being cheated by his manager. I decided to divide the proceeds from his shows. I ordered that three accounts be opened for his personal saving, mother and father. I told his parents that his money should be kept on his account until he reaches maturity age and put it into proper use,” Bigirimana said.
 
Civil Division deputy registrar Sarah Langa said, “When you are the master of ceremony, you cannot miss a selfie with this kind of celeb.”
At the function, the judiciary bid farewell to over 14 judicial officers who have clocked retirement age including the outgoing principal judge Dr Yorokamu Bamwine.
Others are Supreme Court justices Jotham Tumwesigye, Augustine Nshimye, Eldad Mwangusya, high court judges Margaret Oumo-Oguli, Moses Mukiibi, Billy Kainamura, and Rugadya Atwooki.
 
Others include registrars Thaddeus Opefeni, Joy Kabagye and Magistrates Francis Nkurunziza, Simon Peter Odo and Mukasa Namagembe.  
Each of them was recognised for their dedicated service to the judiciary

The big winner on the night was acrylic painter ‘Lavish Too Nice’, a talented artist with a brush who won three awards on the night. A few months ago he did a painting of Enzo Ishall on a pair of sneakers that he gave to the Zimdancehall artist when he came to the UK for a show.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is finally over and Jacqueline Jossa crowned Queen of the Jungle.
In emotional scenes last night (09.12.19), the former EastEnders actress beat Coronation Street's Andy Whyment and radio DJ Roman Kemp to become the winner.

The episode mostly stuck to the usual I'm A Celebrity final format, putting each of the finalists through a last Bushtucker Trial before revealing who had come in third place.
Once Roman had said his goodbyes and done his exit interview, Jac and Andy were brought in for a chat with hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly before the winner was revealed.
But viewers noticed that there were several key changes to the format of the final this year.
Most notably, the remaining celebs didn't get to meet their loved ones in the camp.
Usually, the contestants get to see family members before a winner is crowned and, as it usually makes for emotional viewing, the absence was felt among viewers at home.
Similarly, the way the celebrities exited the jungle appeared to have been switched up.
When Jacqueline walked across the bridge holding her wooden sceptre and wearing her laurel crown, she rushed tearfully into the arms of her husband, Dan Osborne.
But when Roman crossed the bridge, viewers didn't get to see him greeted by a loved one, while the scene of Andy walking across wasn't shown at all.
On Twitter, viewers wondered why the key scenes appeared to have been cut from the final episode.
One said: "No one met Roman at the end of the bridge? I'm sure the majority of lasses in the UK would have #ImACeleb."
Another wrote: "If I knew no one was going to meet Roman at the end of the bridge, I could have taken their place #ImACeleb."
A third tweeted, "Andy doesn't get his walk off across the bridge?" with a sad face emoji.
Someone else said: "This whole experience meant so much to Andy and he doesn't even get to walk over the bridge because he came second."
"Gutted that the families didn't go into I'm A Celeb this year," wrote a fifth.
Another said: "Feel like the final's been quite rushed this year, they didn't even have their families surprise them in the jungle #ImACeleb."
"Just realised that none of the celebs got to see their families a few days before they would've finished," said someone else, adding for clarity: "You know, when they get surprised?"
ED! contacted ITV for comment and an I'm A Celebrity spokesperson said: "Families entering the jungle is a show format point that we don't do every year, unlike letters from home and celebrity cyclone."

There was another key change to the final format that viewers didn't seem happy about.
After Jacqueline was named Queen of the Jungle, fans of the show were naturally expecting last year's King, football manager Harry Redknapp, to hand the crown over to the new winner.
But instead, Extra Camp hosts Emily Atack, Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas brought it out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Age Beverages Stock Remains a High-Risk, High-Reward Situation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in late September, I wrote here that small-cap beverage company New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) looked like a potential multi-bagger. But, I also cautioned that four big risks could challenge that multi-bagger thesis. Ultimately, I labeled NBEV stock as a high-risk, high-reward investment.
Fast forward two months. The “high-risk” part has won out so far. NBEV stock has lost about 30% of its value.The culprit? Mixed third quarter numbers. While New Age Beverages did show off huge revenue growth in the quarter, expenses grew by much more than sales. Yet again, the company wasn’t profitable, and this lack of profitability is starting to concern investors in a big way.
After considering the third quarter print, I’ve slightly changed my thesis on NBEV stock. Before, I saw NBEV stock as a high-risk, high-reward investment, where the reward part outweighed the risk part. Now, profitability concerns have made me less optimistic. I see NBEV stock as a high-risk, high-reward investment, where the potential risks and rewards offset one another.
Sure, NBEV stock could still be a multi-bagger. But now I have less conviction in that happening any time soon than I did two months ago.
Zooming out, New Age Beverages stock still has multi-bagger potential, despite its late 2019 sell-off.
The core ideas behind the multi-bagger bull thesis are simple. New Age Beverages has a very relevant product portfolio, comprised of health-oriented and organic beverages that consumers are increasingly demanding today as they become more health-conscious and eco-friendly. At the same time, that very relevant product portfolio is finally gaining national distribution, as the company has landed big partnerships with the likes of Circle K, 7-Eleven and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). This dynamic alone — relevant products gaining more distribution — should power healthy revenue growth at New Age Beverages for the next few years.
On top of all that, New Age Beverages also has a CBD catalyst, as the company is in the early stages of rolling out CBD-infused beverages in multiple international markets. This catalyst is a wild-card. But, if New Age does successfully turn into a relevant player in the CBD beverage market, then that will undoubtedly add big growth to the top-line.
Big picture — New Age Beverages has multiple catalysts on the horizon, the sum of which should power healthy revenue growth over the next few years. All management needs to do in order to generate sizable profits, then, is sustain 60%-plus gross margins (they are already there) and manage expenses lower.
If they do that, this company could produce 75 cents in EPS by fiscal 2025. Based on a consumer discretionary average 20-times forward multiple, that implies a 2024 price target for NBEV stock of $15 — more than seven-fold the current price tag.
Although the multi-bagger thesis for NBEV stock remains alive, the risks surrounding this stock are more apparent than ever before.
The biggest risk for New Age Beverages is profitability, or lack thereof. Sure, the company is growing sales by leaps and bounds today (basically 400%-plus revenue growth all year long). But, that big growth is being driven by even bigger expense growth (700%-plus operating expense growth all year long). This is nothing new for New Age Beverages. In both 2017 and 2018, expense increases also dramatically outpaced revenue growth.
This dynamic makes complete sense if you consider the competitive landscape in which New Age operates. The beverage market is a very tough one, with fickle demand and very little customer loyalty. Sure, New Age’s beverage portfolio has huge upside potential given its composition. But, the drinks still may not stand out in the crowded functional drink market. If they don’t stand out, New Age Beverages will have to spend more to get them to stand out. That’s exactly what has been going on. New Age’s drinks are standing out, but largely because the beverage maker is paying up for them to stand out.
The competitive dynamic in this segment of the fast-moving CPG brands won’t change anytime soon. Thus, it’s unlikely that New Age’s problem of having to spend big to grow big will change anytime soon, either. Instead, what’s far more likely is that New Age’s expenses continue to run higher alongside revenues.
That’s a problem. Gross margins are above 60%, which is already high for a soft beverage company (average gross margins in the industry are 56%). So, there’s not much more firepower on the gross margin expansion front. Yet, the company is still unprofitable today. So, in order to drive a profit, New Age needs positive operating leverage.
That positive operating leverage may be hard to come by. If so, then NBEV stock will remain weak.
NBEV stock remains a high-risk, high-reward investment, where the potential risks are rising and the potential rewards are becoming less visible. Yes, shares could rise seven-fold in the long run. But, the likelihood of that happening is becoming smaller and smaller as profitability issues become more and more glaring.
So long as these profitability issues hang around, NBEV stock will remain lower for longer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GE Stock is a Buy as CEO Larry Culp Addresses the Mess He Inherited</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Larry Culp deserves credit for breathing new life into the GE stock price, which has surged more than 50% since January. The stock has more room to run in 2020 as Culp cleans up the mess left by his predecessors.
During the most recent quarter, GE announced or completed more than $9 billion in “Industrial delevering actions” along with changes to its U.S. pension benefits that the company estimates will reduce the firm’s Industrial net debt by between $4 billion to $6 billion. 
The company received $3 billion in net cash proceeds during the latest quarter as it continues to sell its stake in its oil/gas joint venture with Baker Hughes. It also netted $1.6 billion from unloading its stake in Wabtec (NYSE:WAB). GE’s Railroad business merged with Wabtec, formerly known as Westinghouse, last year. Next up, Culp and his team expect to close the $21 billion sales of its life sciences business to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) early in 2020.
Though GE’s finances are still an expensive hot mess, there are some reasons for optimism, although the company’s various businesses are not firing on all cylinders. GE stock currently trades at about $11.10 about an 6% discount to Wall Street analysts’ median 52-week target of $11.75, according to CNN. Yahoo Finance shows the consensus at $10.55. The company’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is 16.2x, under the average S&P 500 index multiple of 19x.
GE’s Power business, which for years was a cash cow, lost $144 million in the most recent quarter, an improvement from a $676 million loss a year earlier. Revenue for the business fell 14% to $3.93 billion amid a slump in orders for gas turbines. Though General Electric’s Renewable Energy division continues to hum along nicely, it is much smaller than the conventional power business.
Revenue at Renewable Energy rose 13% to $4.25 billion. Orders surged 30% to $5.02 billion, fueled by strong demand for Wind Energy turbines. Though GE reported a $98 million loss in the quarter, that was due to increased spending on research and development. As climate change becomes a growing concern, GE stands to benefit from the increasing demand for offshore wind capacity, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 25% through 2024, according to Global Industry Analysis.
Boeing’s grounding of the 737 Max is hurting the company’s Aviation business. Even so, the division is holding up. Revenue rose 8% to $8.1 billion, while segment profit jumped 3% $1.3 billion. However, the economic outlook for airlines can turn on a dime. According to the International Air Transport Association, the worldwide airline fleet is expected to increase by more than 1,000 aircraft to 30,000 by the end of 2020, though the outlook has worsened, and uncertainty has grown.
GE Capital reported a loss of $663 million thanks to a $1 billion charge after the company took its Annual Insurance U.S. GAAP premium deficiency test. Excluding this one-time item, adjusted earnings rose to $123 million due to lower impairments and lower excess interest costs. The business, which has been “de-levering” its balance sheet, ended the quarter with $121 million of assets, including $11.8 billion in liquidity.
GE’s Healthcare business is another question mark; The biopharma business GE is selling to Danaher is the division’s fastest-growing. Otherwise, Healthcare’s performance is okay but not great. Revenue during the most recent quarter revenue rose 5% to $4.92 billion while profit jumped 13% to $974 billion. However, that increase was driven by “volume and cost productivity, partially offset by inflation, tariffs, and program investments.”
Larry Culp is assembling a new team to take the venerable General Electric back and beyond to its glory days. GE stock holders may have been disappointed with the decision late last week to keep the dividend at a penny — “why bother,” many asked — but the new CEO is running a marathon, not a sprint.
When Culp came in to the job a little more than a year ago, pundits were quick to rattle off the litany of items on his to-do list, a list that was really made up of things his predecessors failed to-do, shouldn’t have done or simply, didn’t do right. They were also happy to point out what Culp stands to make if he and his team gets things right.
General Electric stock investors, willing to get on board for the long term, are beginning to grasp what their take could be if those things happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">House GOP Lawyer’s ‘Straw Man’ Argument: Impeaching the President Over ‘8 Lines’ Is ‘Baloney’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Castor, who you may remember from the House Intelligence Committee phase of the impeachment inquiry, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday to present the case as to why the president should not be impeached. Castor argued during his opening statement that it would be “baloney” to impeach President Donald Trump over “eight lines” in the non-verbatim memo of Trump’s infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
It was an argument immediately called out as a combination of “straw man” and a “red herring.”
Watch Castor’s statement below:
Castor said that rather than violating his oath of office, President Trump took care to faithfully execute the laws. He echoed George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley’s criticism of Democrats, about undertaking a so-called “rushed impeachment.” (Turley was one of four constitutional law experts who testified last week, and the only expert called by Republicans. The other three, called by Democrats, all said it was clear Trump committed impeachable offenses.)
“The artificial and arbitrary political deadline by which Democrats are determined to finish impeachment by Christmas leads to a rushed process and missed opportunities to obtain relevant information,” Castor said.
Castor went on to make some arguments that raised the eyebrows of numerous observers.
“Democrats didn’t even try to hold witness who defied subpoenas in contempt.”

The implications of discrediting Michael Cohen, the president’s now-incarcerated former longtime attorney and fixer… while the president’s current personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.
The Mueller investigation was too long, and this one is too short.
Castor focused on the “process” and Democrats, not the substance of the allegations against the president.

Lying about a “key point”? We know the Ukrainians knew military aid was withheld before it was publicly reported for the first time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US SEC Re-Opens Infamous Bitcoin Scammer Case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to recent documents, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes that the case against the serial Ponzi scammer, Renwick Haddow, has yet to be properly solved.
The United States SEC does not appear to be satisfied with the New York Southern District Court judge’s decision regarding the case against Renwick Haddow. Judge Lorna G. Schofield ordered the closure of the case, which the SEC initially brought against the widely renowned scammer.
According to the latest report however, the regulator is now seeking to re-open the case, claiming that there are still several matters to be solved, particularly when it comes to monetary penalties that the United States SEC wishes to see imposed on the Ponzi fraudster.
Haddow is known for a number of high profile schemes, but his US-based hot-desking business known as Bar Works is likely the best-known one. The scheme essentially sold fake investments in unused restaurants and bars across several American cities, including NYC and San Francisco. However, he also had a temporary office in Istanbul.
He scammed over 100 UAE investors, who claimed to have lost millions of dirhams in this particular scheme.
His other big scams involved fronting a corporate network known as the ‘Capital Organization,’ which consisted of 30 shell companies responsible for conning investors out of a total of $180 million, according to a 2015 World Policy report . And also his so-called Bitcoin Store Inc and 7th Avenue companies, which he used to steal $37 million from unsuspecting investors between 2015-17.
The SEC initially brought the case against Haddow due to several of his fraudulent operations. Following the court’s decision that the case should be closed, the SEC sent letters and requests to Judge Lorna G. Schofield, requesting that the court re-opens the case. The SEC complaint is that the court has yet to resolve the issue of monetary penalties.
The regulator also anticipates that two scenarios might be possible once Haddow is sentenced. The first one will see the parties reach a monetary relief settlement, while the other will lead the regulator to make a motion to seek monetary relief on its own.
For now, Haddow remains permanently restrained, as per the consent judgment. He is also forbidden to use any national securities exchange, as well as any instrumentality of interstate commerce. Simply put, the judgment will see him completely cut off from security trades.
This decision was brought to stop him from conducting another scheme, mislead others, or engage in any practice of business that might result in a new fraud.
Earlier this year, in May, Haddow (who also goes by the alias Jonathan Black) admitted that he was involved in schemes regarding Bar Works and Bitcoin Store Inc. However, Haddow was originally charged two years prior, in June 2017.
He was also extradited from Morocco almost a year later, in April 2018. At the time, he was also charged with wire fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud, to which he pleaded guilty.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United State Supreme Court announced on Monday that it declined to consider the challenge to a Kentucky law requiring doctors to show patients ultrasounds before they receive an abortion.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a challenge against the law in September. They described the statute as a coercive tactic to get patients to avoid abortions.
“Kentucky’s mandatory narrated ultrasound law forces doctors to display and describe a patient’s ultrasound images against the patient’s will — while they are lying on the exam table, half-naked, with a probe inside their vagina,” theywrote. “The only reason to force doctors to display and describe an ultrasound before an abortion — against a patient’s will — is to shame and coerce someone who has decided to end a pregnancy. The Supreme Court should strike these laws down once and for all.”
Four justices must sign off for the entire court to hear the case.
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the law. The petitioners, including the EMW Women’s Surgical Center, challenged it on First Amendment grounds. From the ACLU’s petition for a writ of certiorari:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crypto Payments Now Legal in Ukraine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lawmakers in Ukraine have adopted new legislation that legalizes crypto payments as the country moves forward with strict compliance to international anti-money laundering (AML) standards.
According to Forklog, members of the Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine’s legislative arm, have adopted a new bill that incorporates international AML best practices into the country’s crypto regulatory framework.
As part of the newly adopted legislation, cryptos are now classified as property in Ukraine. Thus, virtual currency owners can use their digital holdings as a medium of exchange allowing room for legalized trading, payments, investments, and transfers.
Details of the new law also include a provision for private individuals to act as crypto money transmitters and custodians. Such services must, however, operate in strict compliance with financial monitoring and reporting standards prescribed by the newly adopted bill.
The news of the legalization of cryptoasset payments comes on the heels of an announcement by the country’s Ministry of Digital Transformation of its partnership with a Belarusian crypto exchange. As reported by Bitcoinist, the move aims to learn from the Belarusian experience in creating a legal framework for payments and virtual currency adoption in general.
By legalizing crypto payments, Ukraine appears to have taken a significant step in boosting local virtual currency commerce in the country. Earlier in the year, the city of Kyiv announced that it was considering allowing bitcoin payments in its public transport system.
By adopting the new regulatory standards for crypto payments, Ukraine is also complying with the guidelines introduced by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Since the start of 2019, the FATF has been keen on directing member nations to enact more stringent regulatory provisions.
The main focus for the FATF concerning crypto has been compliance with AML regulations. Several crypto exchanges have been forced to comply with FATF ‘Travel Rule.’
In preparing the bill, Ukrainian lawmakers reportedly collaborated with European Union (EU)-funded crypto experts. Ukraine’s government will also be hoping that the adoption of the new laws will aid its quest in securing up to €500 million in financial assistance from the (EU).
Since assuming office, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has adopted a positive stance towards digital and blockchain technology. Reports indicate that the Zelensky administration sees blockchain adoption as a path towards fighting systemic corruption in the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taotronics SoundSurge 46 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones review – Best bang-for-your buck Noise Cancelling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Noise-cancelling is the current trend in headsets, and it’s one that makes sense in an increasingly, busy cacophonous world. The current kings on that arena are still Sony and Bose, who make the very best sets available. They’re still far too expensive for most, but ubiquity has led to competition – not just with features and function, but also affordability.
Noise cancelling headsets now run the gamut from thousands of Rands, to less than a thousand, each offering varying features for their price. One of the best sets to find a good balance between price and performance that I’ve used is the Taotronics TT-BH22. Though it has a few design issues, it offered a warm and rich sound, with feedback noise cancelling that surpassed more expensive sets. The follow-up set, the Taotronics Soundsurge 46 not only has a better name but also switches to a better form of noise cancelling. Instead of the cheaper to implement single-microphone, there’s now also a second, external microphone to help filter out extraneous noise.
Funnily, it’s not as immediately impressive as the noise cancelling on the TT-BH22, but that’s because that set did a better job of passive noise isolation. It is, however, far better at reducing the constant hums of traffic, fans, air condition and the other churning, droning cacophony of everyday life. I found the set to be especially good at removing the sometimes-overwhelming din of being at gym. I’ve used it on a long-haul flight, and it worked better than I expected for the purpose, removing the terribly pervasive roar of plane engines. As with most noise-cancelling though, it’s not especially good at removing sharp sounds like clattering mechanical keyboards, barking dogs or the sound of Darryn screaming from the basement he’s currently locked in.
Its noise-cancelling however, isn’t its best feature. That honour goes to its wonderful fast-charging capabilities. Though the set, like its forebear, is still fitted with the soon-to-be-outdated micro USB port, it allows for fast-charging, letting you get a few hours of listening off a 5-minute charge. That’s a godsend if you’ve somehow forgotten to charge the thing and need to dash out, but also a necessity given that the Soundsurge 46 carries through one of the biggest design faults of the previous set. There’s a dedicated toggle switch for noise cancelling, which means that it’s far too easy to forget to switch it off, leaving the batteries draining while they’re cancelling sound for an audience of zero. It’s not a problem that’s unique to TaoTronics, but it would be nicer to have a software-controlled noise-cancelling function that switched itself off when the headset itself switches off. The noise-cancelling drains the battery fairly quickly, reducing the manufacturer’s promised 30 hours of battery life considerably. I generally got around 20 hours off a single charge, using the set wirelessly with noise cancelling on.
While the Soundsurge 46, with its deep 40mm drivers has a better overall sound than the TT-BH22, I prefer the latter’s tuning, though the bass here is less likely to fatigue. Most modern, expensive headsets favour a neutral, flat sound that highlights authenticity in sound reproduction, The Soundsurge 46 is tuned like many consumer headsets from years ago – with a larger focus on thumping, punchy bass. That’s not to say that they’re tuned poorly or sound bad by any means; I think the best descriptor for their signature is “fun.” Music has a good, deep thud, and – when combined with the noise cancelling – is a delightful aural cocoon. The bass may be at the forefront, but it’s by no means overpowering. Listening to bass-heavy music like Portishead’s 1994 masterpiece Dummy, right through to Fleetwood Mac’s seminal “Rumours” (the beginning thumps of “Second Hand News” come through beautifully), and more modern fare like Post Malone’s Sunflower and Tool’s Fear Inoculum, it all came through warmly. There is perhaps a bit of dynamism that’s lost in the highs and mids, but it’s never muddy.
Unfortunately, despite some reports to the contrary, the set only supports Bluetooth 4.2, and worse still is that it uses the SBC codec instead of more modern, less compressed ones like aptX and LDAC. Thankfully, unlike the TT-BH22, it still sounds good used wirelessly and without ANC. The call microphone uses Qualcomm’s cVc noise cancelling, but like many products in this category, voice calls can sound hollow as a result.
Aesthetics are subjective, but I like the design of the Soundsurge 46. Unlike the TT-BH22’s that blatantly copy the Bose Quiet Comfort II, these have an understated, almost industrial design. A little generic? Sure, but sleek. Unlike that set, it doesn’t fold up for travel, but is portable enough thanks to cups that swivel 180 on their hinges. They also swivel back and forth on those hinges, ensuring a comfortable fit. The headband is pliable enough that it’s not brittle but remains sturdy. The cups and the underside of the headband are decked with soft foam and protein leather, making for a comfortable fit. The included accessories are generous. Not only do you get the usual charging cable, but also a 3.5mm cable, an aeroplane adapter, and a handy, durable carry-case.
On the right cup, you’ve got a 3.5mm jack and the physical button to enable noise cancelling, along with three buttons that all serve double (and in some cases triple) duty. The power button is used not just to switch the set on and off, but also to enable pairing, while the volume buttons can also be used to skip through tracks and answer calls.
They’re available from Takealot for R1899.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Massive US military convoy arrives base in western Iraq: media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIRUT, LEBANON (12:20 P.M.) – A massive U.S. military convoy reportedly arrived in western Iraq this week amid recent attacks carried out near their installations inside the country.
According to Al-Sumaria TV, the U.S. military convoy consisted of 500 vehicles that entered Iraq from neighboring Jordan.
The U.S. military convoy reportedly reached their final destination at the ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base in Iraq’s Al-Anbar province.
No further details were released regarding the alleged U.S. military convoy.
Last week, a rocket attack was reported near the ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base in the Heet District of Al-Anbar – no one claimed responsibility for the projectile fire.
Since then, at least two more attacks were reported near U.S. military installations in Iraq, with the most recent taking place around the Baghdad International Airport.
The ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base is the second largest installation under the U.S. military’s control in Iraq; it was previously under attack by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Daesh) terrorist organization for three years before their defeat in late 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China’s advanced type PCL191 multiple rocket system in strategic proximity to Taiwan – reports</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A report in the latest issue of Modern Ships praises the Chinese multiple launch rocket system called the Type PCL191 as the most cutting-edge piece of weaponry capable of firing both rockets and ballistic missiles. The modular launcher appears to be based on the AR3 system intended for the export market.
Unlike other weaponry on display in Beijing during China’s National Day military parade on 1 October, the Type PCL191, dubbed by CCTV as “a self-propelled rocket launcher with precision strike capability”, traveled up and down the streets of the capital loaded on the back of heavy-duty trucks almost anonymously, the report has it.
It also gives an in-depth description of the system’s capacity saying it can carry eight 370 mm (14½ inch) rockets – each with a range of 350 km (220 miles) – or two 750 mm Fire Dragon 480 tactical ballistic missiles, capable of flying up to 500 km.
According to PLA Daily, an MLRS brigade was stationed with the 72nd Group Army in Huzhou, in the province of Zhejiang on China’s eastern seaboard. Separately, per an a military source unnamed due to the sensitivity of the subject, another PCL191 brigade is based to the south of Huzhou, in Xiamen, Fujian Province, the closest place to Taiwan on mainland China.
The Taiwan Strait, which separates the mainland from Taiwan deemed by Beijing as a part of China’s sovereign territory, is no more than 180 km across.
Speaking to CCTV in October, Wang Tanshen, a master sergeant with the 72nd Group Army’s artillery brigade, noted that the range of the new launch system exceeded that of its closest predecessor by “seven times”.
“The new generation MLRS has extended our firing range to cover everywhere we want to hit”. he remarked.
According to Song Zhongping, a military commentator for Phoenix Television in Hong Kong, Chinese scientists’ extremely hard work is behind the state-of-the-art capabilities and range of the PLA’s multiple launch rocket systems.
“Chinese MLRS technology has kept pace with American products, which have also successfully merged rockets and missiles”, the former instructor with the PLA’s Second Artillery Corp said.
He further elaborated on what exactly had been specially developed in the PCL191s, which require only three people to operate them.
“Scientists have upgraded the chassis [of the trucks that carry the launchers], the explosives [used to propel the rockets and missiles], and other technologies to extend the firing range of the MLRS and improve its precision strike capabilities”, he said.
Chinese missiles and rockets are guided by the domestically designed BeiDou navigation satellite system, the closest rival to the United States’ GPS system.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unknown gunmen attack Syrian intelligence checkpoint in Daraa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIRUT, LEBANON (12:00 P.M.) – A group of unknown gunmen carried out an attack on a checkpoint belonging to the Syrian Air Force Intelligence in eastern Daraa this morning.
According to local reports, the gunmen, who were suspected to be members of a Free Syrian Army (FSA), Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) or Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Daesh) sleeper cell, opened fire on the checkpoint before fleeing in an unknown direction.
The reports said there were casualties among the Syrian Air Force Intelligence personnel; however, the total dead and wounded is unknown.
These attacks by the FSA, HTS, and ISIS sleeper cells have decreased over the last four months, thanks in large part to the increase of Syrian Army troops in the Daraa Governorate.
However, with the absence of Syrian military personnel in some of the reconciled towns in the Daraa Governorate, it has been difficult to crackdown on these sleeper cells.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Africom confirms Russian air defense system downed US drone in Libya</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">U.S. Africa Command (Africom) has confirmed that an unarmed American drone over the Libyan capital last month was shot down by Russian air defenses, reported Reuters.
Africom dropped three headlines via Reuters in the overnight, revealing how the surveillance drone was shot down over Tripoli.
The headlines specify Russian military contractors have operated alongside east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya’s bloody civil war. The contractors used Russian missile defense systems last month to shoot down a US drone.
Africom’s Gen. Stephen Townsend told Reuters in a statement that he believes the Russian air defense operators “didn’t know it was a US remotely piloted aircraft when they fired on it.”
“But they certainly know who it belongs to now and they are refusing to return it. They say they don’t know where it is, but I am not buying it,” Townsend said.
Africom’s spokesman Air Force Col. Christopher Karns told Reuters that either Russian military contractors or Haftar’s Libyan National Army were operating Russian missile launchers at the time the incident was reported around Nov. 21.
Karns said Africom believes air defense operators accidentally shot down the US drone after “mistaking it for an opposition” aircraft.
Townsend also said Russia’s increasing presence in Oil-rich Libya had alarmed Africom.
“This highlights the malign influence of Russian mercenaries acting to influence the outcome of the civil war in Libya, and who are directly responsible for the recent and sharp increase in fighting, casualties and destruction around Tripoli,” Townsend said.
Libya was thrown into civil war nearly a decade ago when NATO forces overthrew Moammar Gadhafi. It’s been another great blunder for Western military forces who’ve spent the last several decades crusading around the Middle East.
The latest outbreak of fighting has been based in Tripoli. Since about 2015, Libya has seen its government splintered into two, one based in Tripoli and the other in the country’s east. The eastern government forces have been attempting to recapture Tripoli since April, and fierce fighting in the capital continues into the late year.

For many, it must be appalling, even more, repulsive that South African born, Zozibini Tunzi, is currently the reigning Miss Universe.‘ Why?’
Since time immemorial, being light-skinned and having straight long hair has been the archetype of what beauty is,. Consequently, many enterprises have profiteered from the misconstrued belief and thus, pumping the African markets with skin lightening and hair straightening products to reinforce the stereotype of beauty.  Blame this on colonisation. but that is a conversation for another day.
So it wouldn’t seem bonkers to be surprised how the South African black beauty, who, rocking her short kinky hair, clenched the crown at the worlds largest pageant show.
This was even echoed in her speech made at the Tyler Perry  Studios, Georgia, America, where the Pageant was held.
Check out some photos of the women Zozibini was up against, This was no easy feat as these women are very beautiful in their own ways.

Heavy rains have devasted South Africa’s Gauteng Province after massive flash floods resulted in parts of the City of Centurion going underwater. Midrand and Pretoria have also been negatively affected, but the flooding is not quite as bad as that in Centurion.
The rains which have been incessant for the past 5 days are so bad that the Centurion Lake Hotel has actually been flooded.
In other news: Jacob Zuma Poisoned, Rushed To ‘Secret’ Hospital in Cuba for treatment?
The rumour mill is on overdrive after suggestions that former President Jacob Zuma was whisked away “incognito” style to Cuba for an emergency medical procedure after sources claimed he was poisoned.
This would be the second time Jacob Zuma would have been poisoned after the first attempt was allegedly orchestrated by his wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma, known as MaNtuli in 2014 whilst he was president. She was not prosecuted for the alleged poisoning attempt owing to an apparent total lack of evidence.
South Africans, however, are not impressed with the news citing that the former president should be treated in South Africa and not Cuba.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USD/CHF starts new week quiet around 0.9900</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite a 30-pip rebound fueled by the broad-based USD strength on Friday, the USD/CHF pair erased 100 pips for the week and is now staying flat on the day near 0.9900.
The data from the US on Friday revealed that Nonfarm Payrolls in November increased by 266,000 to bear the market expectation of 180,000 and helped the greenback outperform its rivals. The US Dollar Index, which posted losses for five straight days, added 0.3% on Friday to help the pair pull away from its lows. 
Nevertheless, investors seem to be refraining from taking large positions ahead of this week's key events that could potentially impact the market sentiment and the USD's valuation.
The US and China will try to finalize the phase-one of the trade deal before the planned tariff hike goes into effect on December 15th and the Federal Open Market Committee will announce the monetary policy decisions on Wednesday following the two-day meeting that will kick off on Tuesday.
Previewing the FOMC event, "barring unfavourable developments on the trade front in the coming days, we doubt the Fed 2020 central tendency GDP growth projection will be significantly altered, allowing the FOMC to remain “watchfully waiting” as Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester put it," said analysts at National Bank Financial. "Our base case scenario remains for the target range to be left unchanged at 1.50 to 1.75%.”
Confirming the neutral mood on Monday, major European equity indexes are posting small daily losses while the S&P 500 futures remain flat on the day. Furthermore, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield is staying calm near last week's closing level of 1.81%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ECB to leave the interest rates unchanged this week – Deutsche Bank</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deutsche Bank analysts suggest that the market is expecting no changes in interest rates from the ECB this week but the meeting will be closely watched as it’s the first monetary policy decision since President Lagarde came to office.
“It’ll be interesting to see what she says in the subsequent press conference, and whether there are any updates on the upcoming strategic review. In their preview out late last week, our European economists write that they expect the Governing Council “will likely remain cautious and view the balance of risks as still tilted to the downside.” Yet they also say that they think Lagarde will make an immediate change, and they say that “we expect the willingness to use “all instruments” to be conditioned on an assessment of the possible side effects of policy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">FOMC to leave the target range unchanged – NBF</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to analysts at National Bank Financial, the highlight of the week will be the central bank’s monetary policy meeting in the US.
“Heading into their communication blackout period, the message from Fed spokespersons was that both the economy and the target range for the fed funds rate were in a good place. This situation has not changed much judging from the findings of the latest Beige Book. The latter suggested that the U.S. economy as a whole continued to expand modestly from October through mid-November, an impression reinforced by recent purchasing manager surveys.”
“As such, barring unfavourable developments on the trade front in the coming days, we doubt the Fed 2020 central tendency GDP growth projection will be significantly altered, allowing the FOMC to remain “watchfully waiting” as Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester put it. Our base case scenario remains for the target range to be left unchanged at 1.50 to 1.75%.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NZD/USD consolidates last week's gains, trades above mid-0.65s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NZD/USD pair registered one of its largest weekly percentage gains last week as it added more than 140 pips to close at 0.6563. However, with investors moving to the sidelines ahead of this week's key events, the pair struggled to preserve its momentum and was last seen posting small daily gains at 0.6557.
The data published from China on Sunday revealed that the Trade Surplus narrowed to $38.73 billion in November from $42.81 billion amid a 1.1% slump in annual exports but was largely ignored at the start of the week. On the other hand, Statistics New Zealand reported that Manufacturing Sales declined by 0.3% in the third quarter to beat the market expectation of -0.8%.
In the meantime, on the back of the upbeat Nonfarm Payrolls data on Friday, the US Dollar Index snapped its five-day losing streak and finished the week on a strong note. Later this week, the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) monetary policy announcements will be critical for the USD's market valuation.
Moreover, investors will be paying close attention to fresh developments surrounding the US-China trade dispute before the US hikes tariffs on Chinese imports on December 15th. Earlier in the day, China’s Assistant Commerce Minister noted that they were hoping to reach a trade agreement with the US as soon as possible. Trade-sensitive antipodeans could gain traction if sides sign the phase-one of the trade deal to avoid additional tariffs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gold clings to modest gains above $1460 level, lacks follow-through</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gold edged higher on the first day of a new trading week and recovered a part of Friday's post-NFP slide to multi-day lows.
The latest US monthly jobs report surpassed most optimistic estimates, which provided a goodish intraday lift to the US dollar and eventually prompted some aggressive selling around the dollar-denominated commodity.
However, persistent uncertainty over a potential phase one trade deal between the world's two largest economies extended some support to the precious metal's perceived safe-haven status and helped gain some traction on Monday.
It is worth mentioning that top White House Economic Adviser, Larry Kudlow confirmed on Friday that the December 15 deadline to impose new tariffs on around $156 billion worth Chinese products remains in place.
Kudlow also said that the US President Donald Trump is pleased with the progress in trade negotiations, which added to a flurry of recent conflicting trade signals and kept a lid on the optimism and weighed on investors' sentiment.
Adding to this, a pullback in the US Treasury bond yields, which kept the USD bulls on the defensive, further provided an additional boost to the non-yielding yellow metal, albeit the uptick seemed to lack any bullish conviction.
Moreover, investors might also be reluctant to place any aggressive bets ahead of the upcoming event risk, the latest FOMC monetary policy update, which might further contribute towards capping any runaway rally.
Hence, it will be prudent to wait for some strong follow-through buying before positioning for any further intraday appreciating move amid absent relevant market moving economic releases from the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WTI drops 1% towards $ 58.50 amid trade tensions, weak China exports</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WTI (oil futures on NYMEX) is down over $1 from three-month highs of 59.85 reached last Friday after the OPEC and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to deepen their output cuts from 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.7 million bpd until March 2020.
Further, the black gold also derived support from the US oilfield services company, Baker Hughes, data that showed the US Rigs Count fell for the seventh consecutive week to 661, the lowest since April 2017.
However, on Monday, the barrel of WTI corrected after concerns over the Chinese economic situation resurfaced, in the face of a sharp drop in the country’s exports. The weak data highlights the negative impact the US-China trade war is having on the economy.
Meanwhile, markets trade with caution amid looming US tariffs hike on balance of Chinese imports, keeping the higher-yielding oil under pressure. The tariffs hike is effective from this Sunday.
Attention now turns towards the US weekly Crude Stocks data for fresh trading impetus ahead of the FOMC rate decision while trade-related headlined will continue to remain the main market driver.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A little over six years have passed since the original Mercedes-Benz GLA (X156) was unveiled as the smallest crossover in the Mercedes-Benz lineup and its replacement's reveal is just around the corner.
Unless it gets leaked, we will get to see the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLA without any camouflage in less than 48 hours, as the crossover is set for a December 11 online reveal, and Mercedes-Benz has already teased the model on more than one occasion.
Caught by our collaborating spy photographers being tested around the streets of Stuttgart alongside a pre-facelift Mercedes-Benz GLC, the new GLA seems quite a bit bigger than its predecessor.
Slightly longer and taller, the car also seems to have much higher ground clearance, almost identical to the more SUV-like GLC that's following close behind. Mercedes-Benz might have responded to the first-generation GLA's criticism, with many people seeing it more like a raised hatchback than the crossover it so desperately tried to be.
The current generation had a so-called “off-road package” as an option on some markets, which raised the ground clearance a further 2 cm (0.8 inches) alongside other “rugged” modifications. That said, the car in the spy photo gallery looks like it's ready for some off-roading at the mall parking lot with those 21-inch wheels and minuscule tire walls.
Based on the same MFA2 (Modular Front-wheel-drive Architecture 2) platform as the latest A-Class, B-Class, CLA and the first generation of the GLB 7-seat crossover, the all-new GLA will feature similar interior design and an identical engine lineup.
This translates into an assortment of 1.3-liter and 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engines and 1.5 and 2.0-liter diesels, paired with either front-wheel-drive for the less powerful versions and AWD for the others. A plug-in hybrid version and two Mercedes-AMG versions will become available later on in the product-cycle.
You will get the choice of rowing your own with a six-speed manual transmission but two dual-clutch transmissions will also be available - a 7-speed and an 8-speed one for the more powerful engine versions. 🏁

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leyland community hub reopens to public with free Christmas dinners for the over 65s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A group of Leyland charity trustees are celebrating the revival of a vital community hub by serving up free Christmas dinners for the over 65s.
They will host the celebration on Saturday, December 14, at Moss Side Community Centre in Dunkirk Lane, Leyland, from noon to 4pm.
The Moss Side Community Forum took over the reigns of the building at the end of last month and plan to use it to serve the needs of the community and bring people together.
Trustee Loretta Whiteley said: "It needs to be the heart of the community again, especially as we have a fractured society.
"There are so many lonely people out there and it absolutely breaks my heart. When I was growing up, there were a lot of elderly people but they were never alone. Time's have changed and somewhere along the line we've lost that but there's so much we can do.
"I know if a resident was in trouble there'd be a rally cry so that community spirit is certainly there. It just needs strengthening."
The team decided to host the free dinners to reach out to elderly residents in the area.
"We don't want them to feel lonely. We want to get to know them and cover every facet of the community, from toddlers to the elderly. For us, this is a great way to open the centre," Loretta added.
A singer and raffle will entertain the diners while a two-course meal will be served up.
The centre has been closed for four and a half months but during that time it remained the home to several groups, including Scouts, folk dancers and a drama academy.
But Loretta said the trustees plan to serve as many people as possible. They hope to become involved with Alzheimer Society's Dementia Friends programme and South Ribble Borough Council's "holiday hunger" scheme.
They are also exploring the possibility of opening the hub on weekends to offer a community cafe where people struggling with loneliness can make new friends.
"It has so much potential that's never been tapped into as there's never been a lot of events going on there historically. In the four years since I moved back here from London, I've walked past it everyday and I didn't know until recently that it was a community centre," Loretta said.
"We just want to create a hub where everyone can feel welcome, regardless of their age, race or gender."
She added: "Since we received the keys it's been absolute bedlam but a lovely bedlam. It's a great feeling to be back in there and I've never been more proud to sign my name against something.
"It's an honour to be part of this project - we're not doing it for the glory. It's just so exciting. We're like a bunch of giddy children and the future of the building is so bright."
To book a Christmas meal, ring Loretta on 01772 624126.

There are lots of different types of electric bikes, including mountain, road, hybrid, folding and more. Plus, there are various places the motor can live: the front or rear wheel, or by the cranks.
More importantly is whether the motor uses a simple motion sensor or a more advanced torque sensor to decide how much power to apply. In short, it’s best to get a bike with a torque sensor – if you can afford the higher prices they command.
You'll find more buying advice in our roundup of the best electric bikes.
If you don’t like the look of any of the bike deals here, then shop around and see if you can find any deals we’ve missed.
The best places to look are
However, if you’re willing to accept a shop demo bike or one with slight cosmetic damage, there are discounts to be had from sites such as Fully Charged. 
From: HalfordsWas: £499Now: £398  (£101 off) View Deal
Even at the higher price, this is one of the cheapest electric bikes available in the UK, and this is a good discount of that. It's basic, there's no doubt of that, but if you want an electric bike on a tight budget without importing it from China, this is a good option.
From: Rutland CyclineWas: £1299Now: £749  (£550 off) View Deal
A great big 42% off the original price of this electric mountain bike makes the Focus Whistler2 a very good deal. The spec isn't what we'd call high end, and it wouldn't be great value at £1299, but at this price, you can probably live with Shimano Altus gears. 
Like Gtech's Sport bike, this one has no buttons or display on the handlebars: you simply turn it on and go.
There's a choice of small, medium and large frames, with the latter two having 29in wheels and the small one coming with 27.5in. Note that none come with pedals!
Even so, it's a lot of electric bike for the money.
From: Cycle RepublicWas: £3899Now: £2299  (£1600 off) View Deal
A high-end electric mountain bike, the Aspect e10 comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a Bosch CX system with a Purion display. Pedals aren't included with this model, but you can save an extra £150 of this price until 18 November using the code SAVE150 at the checkout.
From: HalfordsWas: £1799Now: £1619  (£180 off) View Deal
Using the Bosch Active Line crank-driven motor and torque sensor, the Felix is a well-equipped touring or commuting bike with 700c wheels. Despite the 300Wh battery, range is up to 60 miles. 
The discount isn't massive, but it's still worth having.
From: HalfordsWas: £1599Now: £1099  (£500 off) View Deal
The Ebco is a mid-range mountain bike with a large-capacity 400Wh battery that's good for 35-55 miles between charges. It comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a mid-mounted motor.
It's also good to see Tektro hydraulic disc brakes for good stopping power.
It's a fine deal at this price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Is USB4 And Do You Need It?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">USB is still one of the most important pieces of technology in the 21st century. They charge your devices, they carry around your folders filled with files you hardly use or look at, and they help to transfer things between devices. But a new USB type is on its way and its going to change everything up. Here's what the USB4 is all about.
The USB4, first announced in March 2019, is marked down as the next generation of USB. Until now, USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and the current model, 3.2, have all been released with features expanding and improving upon the previous generation. This has meant faster upload and download transferring speeds, increased capacities and the ability to transfer files simultaneously. The USB4, however, will turn the humble USB into even more of a powerhouse.
In September 2019, the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) announced USB4's specifications giving us a better idea of what to expect. They would now be able to:
Firstly, speed. The USB4 will come with two speed lanes ⁠— 40Gps and 20Gps. That's already huge upgrade on the USB 3.2, which maxes out at 2.5Gps. That's a momentous amount of data flowing through your trust USB steed within a matter of seconds. Most importantly, it's far faster than internet speeds so while the cloud has been able to make possible the transfer of large files remotely, the USB4 will be incredibly useful when physical delivery of large files will suffice.
Aside from impressive transfer speeds, the USB4 will also be backwards compatible through the use of adapters. While it's compatible with USB 2.0 and higher (if you still use USB 1.0, it's time to upgrade), you probably won't get those mega speeds if you're using legacy cables and ports. Still, it's good to know our older tech won't become completely antiquated once USB4 rolls in. As the USB4 is based on Intel's Thunderbolt 3 specifications, it'll also support most Thunderbolt 3 cables. It's important to understand that Thunderbolt 3 compatibility isn't mandatory on all USB4s once production begins so it's always best to triple check in case your shiny new USB4 compatible laptop or tablet comes without it.
USB4 also promises to be a literal powerhouse. It'll come fitted with USB Power Delivery (USB PD) technology so you can charge your phones and devices through it with up to 100 watts of power. Given so many of us need to power up devices on the go with our laptops or through powerpoints, this will be a welcome improvement.
While it was first expected to be released in late 2019, that prediction is extremely unlikely at this stage. The specification announcement back in September provided no real clues but it's expected the USB4 will start rolling out from mid-2020 after the USB-IF's Compliance Workshop in February 2020.
I mean, laptops are already being fitted with USB4 ports so it can't reasonably be more than a year away. Surely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Break Out Of Apple's Walled Garden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has always been good at keeping people within its own little bubble. The company has strived for an insular ecosystem which can certainly make it tricky for those on the inside looking to break out. But it's by no means impossible.
If you're ready to venture out of the Apple bubble into the wider world of tech, here's how you can do it.
While hardware was once a major reason for jumping over to another brand, the points of difference between physical smartphones these days are pretty minimal. In other words, you're probably reading this because you're tired of iOS, have concerns over Apple's use of data, or simply want the freedom that comes with an Android, Windows, or Linux operating system, rather than switching it up for different hardware.
That being said, there are plenty of non-iOS alternatives to the apps and services available to Apple users, and making the switch over to most of them is fairly straight-forward.
One of the biggest services you'll probably want to cut ties with is iCloud, but luckily, Google Drive is waiting for you with open arms. In fact, it'll even help you transfer a bunch of your data from your iPhone to your new device. Download the app onto your iPhone and sync your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars, then follow these instructions for getting that data onto a new Android phone.
For iMessage, there are a ton of great universal alternatives that you're probably already using, so there shouldn't be any issues for you there. Facebook Messenger is a good start and can even be used as a standalone app, so you can still avoid Facebook proper if that's something you're keen on. If data privacy is important to you, apps like Signal or Wickr will ensure your messages are encrypted. WhatsApp is also another good alternative to iMessage.
When it comes to transferring data from a Mac computer to a PC, things are a little easier – a standard portable hard drive should do the trick. It's worth noting, however, that Apple-specific apps and the files that rely on them won't be able to be used, but chances are there's a good alternative in place.
Some software and services don't even need to be replaced completely, like Apple Music for example, which will work perfectly fine on Windows or Android, but if you plan on ditching Apple completely, Spotify is just as good, if not better for music streaming.
If you like using GarageBand for making or recording music, there are heaps of excellent PC equivalents, whether it's premium software packages like Cubase or Ableton, or free alternatives like Reaper. Movie Maker 10 is a good free replacement for Apple's iMovie if that's something you used for home movies.
In terms of password management, you can easily swap out the iCloud Keychain for a third-party app like 1Password or LastPass. For everything else, a quick Google search should put you on the right path for a suitable Windows/Android replacement.
Of course, you can't ditch the Apple ecosystem while you're running Apple hardware, so think about what operating system you'd like to go with and look into some hardware options. The most common alternative is Android for smartphones and Windows for laptops/desktop PCs, so that's generally a pretty good place to start.
Smartphones have a ton of options, with the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel ranges coming in as the top iPhone contenders. Samsung's phones provide good all-rounder alternatives, while the Pixel is a good bet if you wanna lean into Google's ecosystem a little harder. Outside of those, there are a bunch of other options, such as Huawei, Oppo, and Nokia smartphones.
While Apple was once on top with regards to laptop design, most brands now offer a sleek, slim model with just as much power and portability. Some will even offer far more than just a standard computer. For example, 2-in-1s such as the HP Spectre x360 (pictured above) fold all the way around to become a tablet with touchscreen functionality.
The good thing about making this transition is that you don't have to buy everything in one hit. In fact, there's nothing stopping you from running an iPhone and a Windows PC simultaneously because fortunately, Apple plays nice with a lot of its essential software.
Even if you do have to connect an iPhone to a PC – which is pretty rare these days given the variety of wireless setup options available – you can still easily install and run iTunes on Windows.
In other words, don't feel like you need to run out and buy a whole new suite of personal tech just to rip yourself out of Apple's ecosystem. Go with one device at a time, get a feel for it, and then size-up something else. This approach will also save you from outlaying a large sum of money in one hit, which means you can spend a little more on each item as you go to ensure you're getting quality devices.
Either way, it pays to do your research before jumping into something headfirst.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Best STEM Christmas Gifts For Kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It can feel like the holiday toy-buying gets a little out of hand this time of year. We want to see our kids’ faces light up on Christmas morning, but we don’t want to drown in a sea of plastic to make it happen. That’s why adding a couple of STEM toys into the mix can be such a great middle ground. Kids are naturally curious little beings who like to dabble in science, technology, engineering and maths; parents like to feel as though at least some of their toys have educational value.
So I did some digging to pull together a few classic STEM toys, as well as newer arrivals that will bring out the curious learner in any child on your holiday list this year.
I see no reason not to start teaching chemistry to your baby when we’ve got a book like Organic Chemistry for Babies at our disposal to introduce “the structure of organic, carbon-containing compounds and materials.”
Of course, as they get older, a beginner’s science experiment kit is also a must-have and there are lots of variations out there. You can’t go wrong with Fat Brain’s version, the Disgusting Science Kit, which encourages both scientific learning and potty humour.
Also, crystals. Kids love to grow some crystals, and this Mega Crystal Growing Lab from National Geographic will teach kids about crystal formation and it gives them a nightlight base to display five of their favourite crystals in their bedroom when they’re all done. It’ll be the beginning of their rock collection, because childhood is not childhood without a rock collection.
Another staple for every young scientist is a microscope, and Educational Insights has a couple of good options: The GeoSafari Jr. My First Microscope for preschoolers and the GeoSafari Jr. Talking Microscope for young elementary-aged kids. (Their Kidnoculars are pretty great, too.)
You’re already teaching your baby organic chemistry, so you might as well also grab a copy of Robotics for Babies; it’s never too early to learn these concepts.
Then, by the time your kid is around four years old, it’s time to learn a little coding! You can start to introduce the basic concepts of coding with this 22-piece “Coding Critter” play set. Or, for a more classic robotic look, you might try the Code ‘n Learn Kinderbot, which is also good for ages 3 to 6.
There are coding robots for older kids, too, like the Anki Cozmo, which has an easy-to-use interface that Good Housekeeping says allows kids to “explore and build programs from basic to more advanced.” It’s recommended for kids ages 8 and older.
I have to start this section with one of my all-time favourite building toys: Magna-Tiles.
At $90 for a starter set of 37 pieces, they’re a little pricey (and there are cheaper versions of the same idea out there), but they’re incredibly sturdy. My son got his first set when he was four years old and just the other day, I came downstairs to find he had pulled them out from under the couch and was building some kind of structure to go along with other toys he was playing with. He’s nine years old now. We’ve built everything from simple ice cream cones to elaborate castles with these things, and every kid should have a set.
Runners-up for fun building toys:
For more magnetic fun, the 51-piece GeoSmart Mars Explorer vehicle set is another solid option for kids who want to practice their engineering skills. It comes with four how-to designs, but kids can also create their own.
There’s also the ABCs of Engineering book for the littlest ones. A is for Amplifier, B is for Battery, C is for Carnot Engine. This book will give your infant a solid engineering foundation.
You should, of course, start with the Bayesian Probability for Babies book. (I can’t help myself; I love these so much.)
As they reach preschool age, the Monkey Maths game comes recommended from a couple of parents in our Offspring Facebook Group as a hands-on way to introduce simple addition to young kids. I also like the Super Sorting Pie, which includes 60 counters (seven fruits in five different colours).
Maths Dice Jr. is a good option for kids around six years old—it helps them practice addition and subtraction quickly in their head (and it’s small, so it would make a great stocking stuffer). For a more mathematically advanced child, you might try Maths for Love’s Prime Climb, which utilises addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to move around the board.
For a mix of new STEM activities, you might consider a subscription-based option like KiwiCo, which sends out “crates” of science-, engineering- and art-based projects each month. You can select a membership by age—starting as young as 0-24 months old for the “panda” line and up to a variety of options for teenagers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Lazy Man's Guide To Losing Fat And Building Muscle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Like most guys of a certain vintage, I have mixed feelings about my body. Staying lean and not surrendering to the siren’s call of the dreaded 'Dadbod' is a key concern. But then so is building and maintaining enough muscle so that I can keep up with the young bucks on the soccer field or in the gym.
One of the main keys to success is your diet. You need a meal plan that's high in healthy carbs, fats and proteins. More importantly, it needs to be easy to prepare and affordable - so you'll actually stick to it.
There's no shortage of tips that deal with actual exercise on Lifehacker - instead, this guide focuses on the fuel you should be preparing to build muscle and reduce body fat.
Part anabolic diet, part ketogenic diet and part dopamine diet, this all-rounder is perfect for anyone looking to stay on the health train. It's a super-simple diet protocol that provides everything we need to train, grow, recover and sleep, with minimum disruption to our lives and, critically, not sacrificing taste or enjoyment.
Consider it a dietary form of GPP (General Physical Preparedness). With bodily GPP I want to be able to achieve a number of feats or accomplishments at any given time with no specific training.
For nutritional general preparedness, we’re:
Is it boring to eat this way? Or a chore? Not really. The healthy fats in this diet provide both satiety and sufficient hits of dopamine to keep cravings at bay. Permanently.
Can you eat this way if you have kids? Yes, absolutely. A few variations for Junior and you’re there.
Most supplements are stuffed with all kinds of chemicals that you can't pronounce. It’s a multi-billion-dollar industry that promises silver-bullets yet delivers (mostly) damp squibs.
However, as a guy in a hurry, I need fuel after workouts and to kick-start the day. Sleep is catabolic, meaning it depletes your muscles. That's not good, especially if you're on the lean side to begin with (what's known in the trade as a 'hard-gainer'.)
A sound guiding principle is to start the day with 30g of protein if you're serious about building muscle.
A brown-rice based, all-natural protein is probably a little less effective than some of the other stuff but it helps get me to my macros and I feel somewhat better about it, especially as I'm going to be drinking three of these a day.
A more elaborate 'one-pan keto-feast’' could include sausages, green vegetables, smoked salmon but that will take more time than we have to play with. The omelette is super-speedy.
Variations on this theme could be to include a bowl of porridge and stirring through some protein powder to make 'chocolate protein oats'. The only ingredients for this are milk, water, oats and your protein - in less than 7 minutes you’ll be fuelling up for the day ahead.
In terms of bang-for-your-buck and downright convenience, you can't go past this combination - the Holy Trinity of lunchtime goodness.
Try Sirena tuna, whose label reassures that it's line caught and sustainable etc. Basil oil flavour is especially tasty. Add a tin of Edgells 4 Bean Mix and 90 Second microwave brown rice.
Throw grated cheese over the top of this for more fat, and because, well, cheese makes everything taste better.
Total cost per meal: $5.35
You could roast / bake a tray of vegetables and chuck some chicken breast in the other side of the tray (covered in a little foil tent for half the cooking time (usually 30-35 mins) to stop it drying out.
The beauty of this is that once you've tossed it in the oven, you can go and workout for a bit or play with junior.
However, if you can get yourself a microwave steamer, your whole whole world will change.
Here's how.
Chop up your veg and layer it in the steamer according to how long it takes to cook. Then steam it for about 4 minutes. [Note: sweet potato can handle around 3 mins on its own before you add the greens for the remaining 4 mins. This depends on the power of your microwave so play around with it.]
This could be the end of the story. You serve up your greens with your meat (which you've pan-fried and rested under foil and out of the pan for 5 minutes - this is crucial.)
You'll probably want some seasoning with this though.
Or take things to a completely different level with only a modicum of extra effort.
Drain the veggies, blanche under cold water to stop the cooking process, throw a decent knob of butter into the meat pan and then mix the greens through the butter.
In a restaurant this would be called something like 'twice-cooked greens, keto-style,' or something equally grand, and, as with a lot of the cooking here, it depends on your approach to fats and what your nutritional objectives are.
Additional fats, especially those that have traditionally been considered unhealthy, is
But, if you still want flavour and satiety, then it's worth trying because it makes them taste delicious.
This plan works for busy guys (and gals) for a few key reasons:
Is it perfect? Nope.
Could it be made healthier? Yep, pretty easily. Sub in celery sticks dipped in almond butter for one of the snacks would be an easy tweak.
But bang-for-your-buck simplicity, economy and taste it’s right on the money.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Image Source: Tarah Chieffi
Legend says that the town of Santa Claus, IN, got its name during a town meeting more than 150 years ago. While debating what the town should be called, a gust of wind blew open the doors of the building where the townspeople were gathered and the sound of bells was heard. A child yelled, "It's Santa Claus," and the name stuck. It may take a sliver of faith to believe that story, but that is just what Pat Koch, Chief Elf of Santa Claus, IN, thinks we need a little more of in this world. That is why, each year, Pat and her team of volunteer elves spend countless hours answering the tens of thousands of letters to Santa that come in to the Santa Claus Post Office from all around the world.
Children's letters to Santa have been routed to the Santa Claus Post Office since the early 1900s, with Postmaster James Martin being the first person on record to answer the letters back in 1914. Years later, Pat's father, Jim Yellig (who also played Santa at the local theme park and other regional and national events), took over the growing responsibility of responding to kids' Christmas hopes and wishes. Today, the family legacy has been passed down to Pat, who, at 88 years old, can't bear to see even one letter to Santa go unanswered.

With upwards of 25,000 letters received to the Santa Claus Post Office each year, Pat relies heavily on a team of volunteers and donors to keep the program running. "With Thanksgiving being late in the month this year, we already have a stack of 3,000 letters waiting to be answered. It varies by day, but in total we have close to 100 volunteers who help respond to the letters," Pat told POPSUGAR. There are regular volunteers and individuals who come in when they have time, but there are also a number of local businesses, school clubs, and charitable organizations who volunteer year to year to ensure every single letter is read and responded to with a personalized note "so they know that Santa read their letter." Letters comes in from as far as Germany, Sweden, China, and even Russia. For these, Pat's team turns to local foreign exchange students who can read and respond to the letters in each child's native language.
With so many letters passing through, there are always common themes that stand out. Pat said, "Last year, everybody wanted Hatchimals and slime. Some of our younger volunteers help keep us up-to-date on the newest toys that kids are asking for." Children also have a lot of questions for Santa. "They want to know his favorite color, which cookies he likes best, and even what he does when he needs a restroom break on Christmas Eve."

These letters give everybody a good laugh, but there are always a handful of letters from kids questioning whether Santa is even real. "You can tell these children want to believe. It would be horrible to see these letters go unanswered. To see that children still have faith, belief, awe, and wonder is what keeps us going," Pat said. "With so much drama in life, we could all use a little more faith and happiness. Even adults write to Santa asking for family togetherness, peace, and love. We have so much fun answering these letters and helping to bring a little more joy and peace into the world."
Even with the overwhelming number of letters they already have on their hands, Pat and her elves are happy to answer as many letters as they receive. If you happen to be in the Santa Claus, IN, area, you can stop by the original Santa Claus Post Office and have your kids write and deliver their letters onsite. If not, you can send your letter to Santa Claus, P.O. Box 1, Santa Claus, IN, 47579. While they do receive generous monetary donations each year, they welcome any small donation of money, stamps, or a self-addressed stamped envelope that you'd like to include with your letter. In order to receive a response before Christmas, they ask that all letters be received by Dec. 20, and if you have a large group or class that would like to participate, the sooner you can send them the better.

By the looks of it, this workshop won't be shutting down anytime soon. Pat's own daughter and grandchildren are already joining in to keep the tradition going. What's possibly most magical about all of this, Pat told us, is that "If our town wasn't called Santa Claus, this wouldn't be happening." Whether or not those were Santa's bells ringing outside that town meeting so many years ago, children the world over are lucky that one little girl believed.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Lorenzo Tanos
Despite Anthony Rendon’s previous comments about wanting to end his MLB career at the age of 35, a new report suggests that the 29-year-old third baseman, who last played for the Washington Nationals, might prefer a seven-year contract in free agency, with the Texas Rangers still ranking as a leading candidate for his services.
Citing The Athletic‘s Ken Rosenthal, SBNation blog Lone Star Ball wrote on Sunday that Rendon’s agent, Scott Boras, is looking for teams willing to sign his client to a seven-year deal that would keep him under contract until his age-36 season. As noted, this goes against previous rumors that suggested the slugger prefers a shorter-term deal with a higher average annual value.
Regarding Rendon’s potential destinations in free agency, Lone Star Ball explained that the Rangers are still among the favorites to sign him this offseason. The publication pointed out that the former Nationals star has multiple links to Texas, being a native of the state who played college baseball at Rice University.
“The Rangers apparently see him as the type of veteran star who will age well while providing a solid presence in the clubhouse, and landing Rendon appears to be the team’s top priority this offseason,” the outlet continued.
The above report is not the only one to suggest in recent days that Rendon could be joining the Rangers as a free agent. On Saturday, CBS Sports cited a tweet from Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News, writing that the team’s focus “for the time being” is on signing the superstar third baseman. It wasn’t mentioned whether he’d be seeking a similar deal to what Rosenthal suggested Boras wants, but the outlet brought up multiple reasons why Rendon might end up in Texas — the team’s weakness at third base, its financial capability to sign a marquee free agent, and the fact that the club will be moving to a new ballpark for the 2020 MLB season.

“Granted, it’s Houston — he went to both high school and college (Rice) there — not the Dallas area, but it might make a difference if the money is right,” CBS Sports added, referring to why Rendon might sign with the Rangers as opposed to his actual hometown team, the Houston Astros.
As shown on his Baseball-Reference player page, Rendon has career statistics of 136 home runs, 546 RBIs, and a.290 batting average across seven MLB seasons, all of them with the Nationals. Aside from the Rangers, the former first-round draft pick has also attracted a few other suitors since officially entering free agency, with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies specifically mentioned in recent reports.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019

The late Big Bird puppeteer died on the same day 'Sesame Street' became the first TV series ever to receive the award for lifetime achievement in the arts.
Caroll Spinney was remembered by his Sesame Street co-stars at the 42nd Annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in Washington, D.C., on Sunday. The late children’s television legend, best known as the voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, died at age 85 on the same day Sesame Street became the first television series to receive the award for lifetime achievement in the arts.
Sesame Workshop co-founders Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett were on hand to accept the prestigious award during the bittersweet ceremony. The duo accepted the honor on behalf of Muppets creator Jim Henson, puppeteers Caroll Spinney and Frank Oz, and all the other artists who have worked on the show, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Cast members from the series also honored Spinney, who was a fixture on the long-running PBS children’s show from 1969 until his retirement last year. Iconic Sesame Street Muppets Ernie and Bert, as well as Big Bird (portrayed by Matt Vogel since 2018), appeared at the event, according to Page Six.
Vogel paid tribute to his mentor Spinney in a touching Instagram post hours before he headed to the ceremony.
In a poignant tribute, Sesame Street cast members David Rudman (Cookie Monster), Leslie Carrara-Rudolph (Abby Cadabby), Ryan Dillon (Elmo), Peter Linz (Ernie) and Eric Jacobson (Bert) wore yellow feathers pinned to their chests as they attended the prestigious ceremony with their puppets in hand.
In addition, Sesame Street veteran Sonia Manzano, who played Maria on Sesame Street from 1971 to 2015, expressed sadness over the death of her longtime friend and co-star.
“I’m heartbroken that this happened on this particular day,” Manzano said. “But I’m glad we’re all together.”
On the red carpet, Elmo puppeteer Ryan Dillon described Spinney as “an incredible person” and his biggest inspiration.
“We’re still reeling a little bit and I think the world is going to miss what he brought to it,” the Sesame Street puppeteer said. “He’s here tonight. He’s here tonight.”
Rudman said he knew Spinney for 20 years and that he was a “genius” and a “sweet man.” The Cookie Monster voice actor praised his late Sesame Street co-star’s talent and said he will always miss him.

Kennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein addressed Spinney’s death before the second half of the awards presentation.
“We are all saddened by his loss and the tribute tonight to Sesame Street is in his honor,” Rubenstein told the audience.
CBS’s upcoming Kennedy Center Honors television special will include a special segment in honor of Caroll Spinney, per the Los Angeles Times. CBS entertainment vice president Jack Sussman said a special tribute to the late Sesame Street icon will be produced and added to the TV broadcast set to air on December 15.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson says he will stop immigrants treating Britain 'as their own country'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boris Johnson has vowed to stop European migrants treating the United Kingdom “as their own country” if he wins this week’s general election.
The prime minister on Sunday told Sky News: “”You’ve seen quite a large number of people coming in from the whole of the EU – 580 million population – able to treat the UK as though it’s basically part of their own country and the problem with that is there has been no control at all and I don’t think that is democratically accountable.
He added: “You have got to have a system by which politicians can say to people, ‘Well, yes, we are letting people in but we are doing it in a way that is controlled and checked’.”
The prime minister has promised to reduce net migration if returned to Downing Street.
To do this, he has said he will introduce a points-based system of the sort used in Australia, under which migrants wishing to come to the UK will be given one of three visas depending on their perceived skills level.
Johnson said migrants with “exceptional talents” would be given the most rights to live and work in the UK. Skilled workers, like those in the NHS, would be permitted to move to the UK as long as they had jobs waiting for them. The third group, “unskilled” workers, would be given short-stay visas to work in sectors suffering from shortages.
The Migration Advisory Committee, the independent body that advises ministers on migration policy, would have the power to decide how many migrants each sector needs.
Johnson guaranteed that this system would reduce the number of immigrants after Britain leaves the EU, telling Ridge: “Yes, I can make sure that numbers will come down because we’ll be able to control the system in that way.”
However, experts have questioned Johnson’s proposals and criticised his framing of immigration.
Jonathan Portes, a professor at Kings College London, told the Guardian newspaper that the proposed system undervalued the skills of migrants and would lead to shortages in certain sectors.
“There’s a damaging misconception in this debate that there’s a binary divide between the brain surgeons and the people who pick strawberries – most ordinary immigrants are somewhere in between. Doing jobs that require skills but aren’t necessarily highly skilled, and they would not pass this particular test,” Portes said.
“Butchers, for example, or people who work in abattoirs – this is hard work and you need training. Most come from eastern Europe but are unlikely to make the highly skilled cut.”
The Institute for Government think tank has previously expressed doubt that the UK Home Office, which is responsible for migration, could design and implement entire new immigration system in time for Brexit.
Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats’ Shadow Home Secretary, accused Johnson of “demonising” EU citizens who “contribute so much to our NHS, social care and economy”
She told Business Insider: “This dog-whistle politics is straight out of Nigel Farage or Donald Trump’s playbook.
“Conservative plans to end free movement would mean fewer EU nurses and care workers, and fewer opportunities for UK citizens to move abroad.
“Neither Johnson or Corbyn are standing up for free movement and for the millions of EU nationals who are our friends, colleagues and neighbours. Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Boris, stop Brexit and build a brighter future for the country.”

There’s literally hours of tweets in the Q&A, but we picked out the juicy ones (you’re so damn welcome). So please, sit back and a envision a day when you, too, will miss going to the grocery store.
First up: the tweet that started it all.
Aaaaaaand let’s dive straight into all things Tinseltown, courtesy of queen Chrissy.
From not taking public transport in 10 years, to paying for a whole other private airport terminal, Chrissy’s life sure seems otherworldly, doesn’t it? I’m also sobbing at the mental image of John making pancakes for the kids in the morning. This family can certainly do no wrong.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, over 10 000 people have lost their lives on South African roads during the festive season in the past six years.  With many motorists taking to the roads again this month, Dialdirect implores motorists to be vigilant.
“The true tragedy here is that the bulk of these deaths could have been avoided if motorists took road safety more seriously,” says Maanda Tshifularo, Head of Dialdirect Insurance. “All too often, the price is higher than a damaged or written off vehicle.”
According to JMPD Chief Superintendent, Wayne Minnaar: “The main offenses that motorists commit which cause accidents include speeding, dangerous overtaking and ignoring of white lines, drunken driving, reckless driving, disregarding stop signs and red traffic lights, turning in face of oncoming traffic, entering the road in an unsafe manner, and turning from the wrong lane.”
Dialdirect have put together a list of practical tips to assist you drive right and avoid becoming a statistic this festive season:
CHECKLIST:
GOOD DRIVING PRACTICE:
FATIGUE:
BIKES AND HEAVY MOTOR VEHICLES:
IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN OR YOU’RE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT:
“It is up to each of us to take proactive action to reduce road deaths, but despite our best efforts, tragedy still does strike,” Tshifularo concludes, “It is an absolute must to make sure that you are comprehensively insured so that you can be up and running again in no time.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What an achievement. 
Thanks to a record number of billion dollar blockbusters, Disney has become the first studio in history to surpass $10 billion at the worldwide box office.
Variety are reporting that Disney is imminently set to become the first studio to move beyond the $10 billion mark.
As of Sunday, the current total is at around $9.997 billion, made up $3.28 billion in North America and $6.7 billion in the rest of the world.
This year's Avengers: Endgame ($2.798 billion global takings) and The Lion King live action remake ($1.656 billion) contributed a huge chunk to the milestone, which will be made official before Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens in the next fortnight.
Variety notes that recent Fox films - with that empire acquired by Disney in March - such as Dark Phoenix and Le Mans '66 don't count towards the overall total, otherwise they'd be up at around $11.9 billion.
2019 has been a colossal year for the studio, with five films crossing the billion dollar mark at the box office, Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and Captain Marvel.
As of last weekend, Frozen 2 has clocked in at $920 billion and will almost certainly make it a sixth. As noted, Star Wars is nearly here too.
Meanwhile, Disney have released a brand new trailer for the live action remake of Mulan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AWS Wavelength: The Cloud Comes to Your 5G Network</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What is AWS Wavelength? Among a flurry of product announcements at AWS Re:Invent, one drew arguably the most buzz from attendees on the conference floor: AWS Wavelength. Born of four initial partnerships with telecommunications businesses Verizon, Vodafone, South Korea’s SK Telecom, and Japan’s KDDI, the new service — primed for release in 2020 — aims to bring AWS’s compute and storage services “to the edge of 5G networks”. But what does that really mean?
Computer Business Review took a closer look.
There is no magic here — to an end-user the cloud is after all simply services running on third-party infrastructure — and reading between the lines, AWS Wavelength looks set to involve embedding Amazon’s servers at the telco “edge”, from base stations to telco data centres: anywhere it makes sense to put hardware to cut latency.
Emerging interactive applications like game streaming, virtual reality, and real-time rendering among others require lower latency than “classical” cloud services can manage, AWS noted, and even with 5G, if application traffic has to make too many hops before it hits an AWS data centre, latency suffers as a result.
“Today, application traffic has to travel from a device to a cell tower to metro aggregation sites to regional aggregation sites and to the Internet before it can access resources running in AWS. These network hops can result in latencies of more than 100 milliseconds. This prevents developers from realizing the full potential of 5G to address low-latency use-cases”, AWS explained in its release notes.
By teaming up with telcos to embed AWS hardware in their infrastructure, users will get access to AWS services (initially just Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and Amazon EKS, with more to follow) as close as possible to the point of use.
AWS’s Chris Barclay (principle product manager, tech, EC2) explained to Computer Business Review: “An extension of the AWS cloud within the telco environment, AWS Wavelength uses AWS Outposts as a building block to place AWS capacity into these telco facilities and provide AWS services.
“What’s unique about AWS Wavelength is the ability to create an EC2 instance directly within a telco provider’s network. This would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for customers. Imagine having to contact different telcos, and asking for access to capacity in each of their 5G locations.
“And, even if they could get that capacity, it would be nearly impossible to have a common way to manage across all those providers. Wavelength eliminates all this complexity and lets customers use the same familiar AWS APIs, tools, and functionality they use today, to deliver-low latency applications at the edge of 5G networks around the world…
“[by embedding] AWS compute and storage services within the network operators’ datacenters at the edge of the 5G network, application traffic only needs to travel from the device to a cell tower to a Wavelength Zone running in a metro aggregation site. By creating a subnet in one or more Wavelength Zones, such as Verizon Chicago, and launching resources like EC2 instances in that subnet, we give customers the same development experience that they’re used to.
He added: “AWS is responsible for the service. AWS Wavelength Zones are managed by the same control plane as AWS Availability Zones.”
Customers will use the same AWS APIs that they’re used to, and won’t need to know anything about the telco provider’s infrastructure or APIs.
Pressed on whether there are ways AWS is looking to tie Wavelength more broadly into telco efforts to switch to more cloud-native network functions, Barclay said the service is “an extension of the region for running applications in multi-tenant mode, and does not directly tie into cloud-native functions.”
He added: “However, the underlying technology in AWS Wavelength, which is the ability to run AWS virtual infrastructure in telco sites at the edge of 5G networks, can be used for running cloud-native telco workloads. We are actively evaluating and validating various telco network workloads on our edge infrastructure.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Guardiola in shock admission: ‘We are not able to compete with’ Liverpool, Manchester United…</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pep Guardiola has made some extremely surprising comments following his side’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at the weekend.
Manchester City’s defeat sees them lie six points behind Leicester City, who are in 2nd, and a whopping 14 points behind Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.
Instead of suggesting his team fill fight until the end, Pep has intimated his players are simply not cut out to challenge the likes of Liverpool and the rest of Europe’s elite – oddly naming United amongst the list.
“We have to improve and accept it and move forward,” Guardiola told BBC Sport.
“[Manchester] United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counter-attack and you have to accept that.
“That is the level we face against Liverpool, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus. They are the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them.
“Maybe we need to live that as a club to improve, to accept the reality now and improve.”
Guardiola’s City team have been almost invincible for two Premier League seasons, racking up 100 and then 98 points in title winning campaigns – but it feels like the wheels may be coming off.
This term, they’ve already lost four matches – and the complaints about VAR should not hide repeatedly poor defending from whoever it is who get the nod.
Yes, they’ve missed Aymeric Laporte, but John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi are multi-million pound Premier League champions.
We’re not writing City off, even if Pep is. They’re simply too good a side, and we will be watching with intrigue when they face Leicester in 11 days’ time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This would be a tricky one for the Kop to blare out in unison, but how good would it sound?!
Andy Robertson’s current song is a pretty easy one to remember – and anyone who’s been to Anfield over the past 18 months will have head ‘Oh, Andy Andy!’ sung at one point…
But how about this remix of Gerry Cinnammon’s classic ‘Belter’ as seen in the video below?
It’s a quality song, and suits Robbo perfectly as the original singer is a very well-loved Scot, too.
“And when he plays the Blue Sh*te he will leave the elbow in, he’s Andy Robbo…” is a particular favourite line of ours! 
Props to the lad in the video:

    <h5 class="mb-1">China's Pig Herd Rises for First Time in a Year in November</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING, Dec 9 (Reuters) - China's pig herd increased by 2% in November compared with the prior month, the agriculture ministry said on Monday, the first increase in a year.
Sow stocks were up 4% on October, said the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on its website, the second consecutive month of a rise in the breeding herd inventory.
The closely watched data comes after an epidemic of African swine fever devastated the world's top hog herd, reducing it by 41% year on year by October.
While some analysts have described official numbers as conservative, the ministry figures would still equate to a decline of around 175 million pigs in the national herd.
Dutch firm Rabobank has estimated the herd will be 55% smaller by the end of this year, while others in the industry believe it could be even smaller.
Pork prices have surged to record levels, pushing consumer inflation in China to the highest level in almost eight years, and putting Beijing under growing pressure to ensure supplies ahead of important upcoming holidays.
Recent policies to stabilise production and support the recovery of the pig herd have begun to show results however, said Yang Zhenhai, director of the ministry's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau in the statement.
Ministry data also showed that production of pigs in large-scale farms, or those slaughtering more than 5,000 head a year, increased by 1.9% in November compared with October, while their sow stocks were up 6.1% month on month.
Yang said however that supplies will be tight ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday in late January, after the supply of hogs fell sharply between June and August this year.
Higher imports and the release of frozen pork from state reserves and commercial warehouses should boost supply however, while high prices will curb consumption.
"The overall supply and demand situation may be better than expected," Yang said in the statement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Adds details of case)
By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The European Union confirmed on Monday that it will impose tariffs on imports of biodiesel from Indonesia to counter what it sees as unfair subsidies, concluding a case that has lasted seven years.
The duties, normally in place for five years, have been set at between 8 and 18%, the same level as the provisional rates proposed in August.
Confirmation of the duties are another blow to Indonesian biodiesel producers after the EU said in March that palm oil should be phased out of renewable transport fuels due to palm plantations' contribution to deforestation.
The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the EU, has said its investigation found Indonesian biodiesel producers benefit from grants, tax benefits and access to raw materials below market prices.
The EU biodiesel market is worth an estimated 9 billion euros ($10 billion) a year, with imports from Indonesia worth about 400 million euros, the Commission said. Indonesian producers, it said, sold at unfairly low prices, driving EU producers into losses.
The EU and China are Indonesia's biggest markets for its biodiesel exports.
Indonesia has threatened to impose its own tariffs on EU dairy products.
The European Union also has imposed anti-subsidy duties on Argentine biodiesel producers, although it has tariff-free access for about 1.2 million tonnes as long as they sell no lower than a set minimum price.
The EU began looking into biodiesel from both major producers in 2012 and imposed anti-dumping duties on companies in 2013. However, the firms subsequently won challenges at the European Court of Justice and the World Trade Organization.
This prompted the EU to remove duties on most biodiesel imports from the two countries, but the Commission also started an investigation into possible unfair subsidies. (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Susan Fenton)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saif Ali Khan On Struggling Days: “People Felt I Looked Like A Girl… Akshay Kumar Looked Like A Hero”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saif Ali Khan is one of the most genuine and classy actors we have in Bollywood. His character as Sartaj Singh in Sacred Games wasn’t just applauded by his fans, but critics as well. His last film, Laal Kaptaan, didn’t work great at the box office but his performance won the hearts of audience.
Talking about the hardships in Bollywood, Saif told Pinkvilla that he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do after school. He just didn’t want to do a 9-5 job and hence thought, films are better than that. “I was clueless after school and I didn’t know what to do when I joined films. I just knew I didn’t want to do a desk job. I thought I’ll die if I have to do a 9-5 thing. The idea of films was very different because of the variety of the job,” Saif said.
He further added, “Cricket was in my blood, it’s treated like religion. Not just my dad, my grandad also captained India and played against Don Bradman. I played good cricket and I never played in school or college. What let me down is that cricket is a very mental game, it’s about patience and timing. That I was strongly lacking in and that’s why my cricket career was doomed.”
During the initial days in the industry, Saif revealed how people would tell her that he looked and sounded like a girl in auditions. “People have been nasty. They have been mean. People talk about your looks. I guess I didn’t look like a hero. Akshay Kumar did. They felt I looked like a girl. I certainly had a bad voice which I hadn’t worked on. So sometimes, I was squeaking away in an English accent,” Saif added.
Well, all’s well that ends well. Isn’t it?
On the work front, he will be next seen in Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior opposite Ajay Devgn and the trailer has already garnered him praises from all around.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Governors’ Forum, Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and other 34 governors urging them to use their “leadership position to urgently disclose details of payment of pensions to former governors and other ex-officials between 1999 and 2019 under your state’s pension law, and to provide a copy of the said pension law.”
The organization is also urging each of the 36 state governors to “provide information on whether any such pension law exists in your state, and if so, to provide the names and number of ex-governors and other ex-officials receiving pensions in your state, and to publicly commit to repealing the law, and to pursue recovery of funds collected under the pension law.”
In the letter dated December 9, 2019 and signed by SERAP’s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: “Public officials should not encourage, sustain, or implement jumbo pension laws that show an appearance of conflict of interest, impropriety or create situation of personal enrichment. The pension law negates the duty to act honestly and to represent the needs and concerns of the people, and to refrain from activities, which interfere with the proper discharge of public functions.”
SERAP also said: “Any such pension law also represents the use of public office to advance private interests at the expense of some public interest, suggests the misuse of legitimate discretion for improper reasons, and has created a more cynical public view of politics and politicians.”
According to the organization, “Those who manage the resources of the state ought to protect the interest of the people in their states. Public officials while entrusted with duties and discretions are not to act in their own best interest, but to discharge those duties and exercise those powers in the interests of the public.”
SERAP’s FoI request read in part: “Repealing any such pension law would demonstrate your commitment to public service and the requirements of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). It would show that you would not tolerate the use of public office in a manner which ignores the public interest in order to achieve personal advantage.
“We would be grateful if the requested information is provided to us within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the Registered Trustees of SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions under the FoI Act to compel you to comply with our request.
“Pension law for former governors and other senior ex-officials represents a conflict with the constitutional and legal conflict code of conduct for public officials, and would seem to prioritise private interest of former state officials over and above the public interest and public duties of state governors.
“The duties on public officials including governors flowing from their position as trustees to the public also include the duty to refrain from activities which interfere with the proper discharge of their functions, and the duty not to place themselves in a position where public duty conflicts with private interest.”
SERAP’s request is coming on the heels of the landmark judgment delivered last week by Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo of the Federal High Court, Lagos ordering the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to challenge the legality of states’ pension laws permitting former governors and other ex-public officials to collect such pensions.
The judgment followed the invalidated pension law for former governors and other ex-public officers in Zamfara State, which provided for the upkeep of ex-governors to the tune of N700 million annually.
The state has produced three former governors since 1999.
SERAP’s FoI request further read: “This request is consistent with your constitutional, fiduciary and public service roles, and the spirit of the landmark judgment delivered last week by Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo of the Federal High Court, Lagos in the suit brought by SERAP.
“By Section 1 (1) of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2011, SERAP is entitled as of right to request for or gain access to information, including information on any life pension law for former governors and other senior ex-officials in your states and the details of payments to such officials over the years.
“By Section 4 (a) of the FoI Act, when a person makes a request for information from a public official, institution or agency, the public official, institution or urgency to whom the application is directed is under a binding legal obligation to provide the applicant with the information requested for, except as otherwise provided by the Act, within 7 days after the application is received.
“By Sections 2(3)(d)(V) & (4) of the FoI Act, there is a binding legal duty to ensure that documents containing information relating to any life pension law for former governors and other senior ex-officials in your states and the details of payments to such officials over the years are widely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means.
“The information being requested does not come within the purview of the types of information exempted from disclosure by the provisions of the FoI Act. The information requested for as indicated above, apart from not being exempted from disclosure under the FoI Act, bothers on an issue of national interest, public concern, interest of human rights, social justice, good governance, transparency and accountability.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- with reporting by Digital Desk staff
Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae has been treated for smoke inhalation after a fire in his office/shop earlier this morning.
Emergency services were called to the Kilgarvan village complex which houses his post office and sorting office as well as his political office and shop.
The blaze is believed to have broken out around the fuse board of the filling station in Kilgarvan this morning.
Gardaí are not treating the fire as suspicious.
They say all early indications are that it was accidental.
The emergency services including an ambulance from University Hosptial Kerry was dispatched to the scene and Mr Healy Rae was treated for smoke inhalation, it is believed.
Danny Healy-Rae told Radio Kerry his brother is fine but has gone to hospital as a precaution.
"Michael put out the fire and as a result he has enhaled a bit of smoke," said Danny.
"He's fine, but it was decided that he should go for an x-ray to check himself out.
"It's a shock because it was a bit scary for a few minutes until it was brought under control."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Miss World Rosanna Davison has revealed the meaning behind her newborn daughter’s adorable name.
Taking to Instagram, the new mother shared some more insight into her surrogacy journey after welcoming a baby girl in late November with husband Wes Quirke.
“It’s been 24 hours since we brought baby Sophia home from Kiev, she’s settled in really well & has been getting to know her grandparents & furry big brothers,” she wrote.
The 35-year-old revealed she began her journey to gestational surrogacy in Kiev, Ukraine.“Back when we began the medical & legal side of #oursurrogacyjourney in Feb 2018, we never dreamed that we’d be lucky enough to take our beautiful daughter home for Christmas the very next year.”Opening up about the process, Rosanna said it was “long, stressful and expensive.”“It’s a long, stressful, expensive process and there are no absolute guarantees.”
 At the beginning of this year, we spent a few weeks in Kiev for the egg retrieval process & stayed beside St. Sophia’s Cathedral,” she said, explaining her daughter’s namesake.
“The night before my procedure, we walked up to the cathedral in the freezing cold & Wes Quirke took this photo… we both loved the name & agreed that if we happened to have a baby girl, we’d name her Sophia as a nod to our long journey to become her parents (it also comes from the Greek word for wisdom!)”
Rosanna concluded her heartfelt post by thanking everyone who “supported, guided and helped” over the “past couple of years,” adding; “you know who you are.”
“So here we are! In a magical baby bubble at the most wonderful time of the year.”“We’ll be forever grateful to the many people who have supported, guided & helped us over the last couple of years – you know who you are.”
The couple returned home with their daughter over the weekend as they prepare for the upcoming Christmas holiday period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mooar please! Five reasons why Scarlets fans are falling for Brad Mooar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There’s another Kiwi coach in west Wales and he’s proving a big hit with the fans. RugbyPass takes a look at why Brad Mooar is so popular among the Scarlets faithful.
The results are back
Under Wayne Pivac, Scarlets fans were getting used to being the top Welsh region. In his final season, an injury crisis that was brutal even by modern standards struck and Scarlets were reduced to finishing behind regional rivals Ospreys and Cardiff Blues, missing out on the top tier European competition for the first time in their history.
This season, despite missing fifteen internationals away at the World Cup (many of whom returned injured), they have already picked up five wins – half of last season’s total. A heavy defeat away to Ulster in the Pro14 might have caused more alarm had not nine players been away again with Wales and another 13 still injured, including Gareth Davies, the influential brothers James and Jonathan Davies, props Wyn Jones and Samson Lee, Rhys Patchell, and Aaron Shingler.

A crucial victory away in Bayonne to keep Scarlets hopes alive in the Challenge Cup won’t have done Mooar any harm either. As Cardiff Blues have proved, even Europe’s second tier competition has its charms if you win it.
He’s getting the best out of Steff Evans again
The Scarlets wing’s struggles last season seemed, in many ways, to reflect that of the wider club. He was regularly left to play for Scarlets A to work on his defence and only managed four starts in the league all season, despite injuries biting into the regions’ squad depth. In his absence, the side frequently seemed to miss his attacking spark and their defence was regularly an issue anyway.
This season, he seems to be back to his exciting best. As Evans prepared to lead the side out for his one hundredth regional cap against Toyota Cheetahs, Mooar said, “Steff has been outstanding this season. It’s there for all to see. You can see a real spark, a spring in his step and a smile on his face.”
He also made clear his belief that Evans deserves these rewards, adding, “But what people don’t see is the work and input that he has behind the scenes in team meetings and with other players and how he is continuing to grow himself and helping to grow others. It has been a real pleasure to work with him.”
Evans is very popular with the local fans for his twinkle-toed interventions and his return to form, as well as the vocal backing by the new coach, is a big factor in the current positive feeling towards Mooar. If he can keep it up, fans will start dreaming of another tilt towards the Pro14 title.
He’s put his trust in the wider squad
Evans isn’t the only one who has been making an impression while the big name players were away at the Rugby World Cup. Mooar put his faith in Steff Hughes, long a local favourite, as joint vice-captain of the squad, while captain Ken Owens, and fellow vice-captains the Davies brothers have been away. He has been rewarded with a series of steady performances and displays of leadership as captain, supported by Werner Kruger, the final vice-captain.
Elsewhere, Corey Baldwin and Dan Jones have reminded fans what they can do, Taylor Davies and Jac Morgan have emerged as potential stars, and Kieran Hardy is having a fantastic start to the season. Blade Thomson seems to have put his World Cup disappointment behind him and Josh Macleod continues to put in a shift every week with impressive consistency. Uzair Cassiem, meanwhile, has emerged as a fan favourite on and off the field, enthusiastically engaging with fans before and after his outstanding performances on the field.
Given how many Scarlets players remain injured after the World Cup, and with the Six Nations looming, Mooar’s ability to get the most out of the whole squad bodes well going forward.
He’s balancing flair with pragmatism
The all-court game that Scarlets seek to play is always a little vulnerable to weather and savvy opponents. From the start, Mooar has emphasised his commitment to playing a flair game and has spoken approvingly after games of his players’ desire to play but he has also spoken regularly about playing smart.
Five of Scarlets ten games so far have been within five points (four wins, one last minute loss) and, with the weather getting worse before it gets better, Mooar is right to highlight the need to keep the scoreboard ticking over as well as playing positively. The return of reliable goalkicker Leigh Halfpenny allowed Scarlets to pull away against Bayonne, with the Welsh international kicking four penalties and a conversion to guarantee Scarlets a win.
That said, Scarlets fans are used to a certain attacking style and Mooar has made clear he is not only aware of that but keen to continue the traditions. If he can find a way to maintain a thrilling attacking game while adopting a more streetwise approach when needed, he is going to remain very highly thought of.
He’s engaging the fans
When Mooar was announced, Scarlets general manager Jon Daniels said, “Throughout the process we have been hugely impressed with Brad’s appreciation of Scarlets’ place in the community, his passion for developing players and the research he had done on our heritage.”
And, from the off, Mooar has made sure fans understand he really is aware of Scarlets’ culture and history. From his introductory greeting, when he mentioned knowing, “the Carwyn James, Phil Bennetts, the Delme Thomases, the Quinnells, Ken Owens, Foxy” to his video personally thanking fans for their support, shot against the backdrop of west Wales and referencing the travelling support’s rendition of Sospan Fach, it’s clear Mooar has done his homework.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star Screen Awards 2019: From Shahid Kapoor To Kiara Advani – Best & Worst Dressed Of The Night!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another much anticipated glamour event of the year, Star Screen Awards 2019, took place in the city yesterday. From Ananya Panday, Sara Ali Khan, to Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Shahid Kapoor, Ranveer Singh amongst others, celebs put their best fashion foot forward. But did their fashion choices really work out as they expected them to? Let’s find out.
From Sara Ali Khan’s glittery attire to Shahid Kapoor’s funky look – below are the Best and the Worst dressed of Star Screen Awards 2019:
Sara Ali Khan
No matter what she wears, her grace just makes everything look better. Sara opted for a Paule Ka black and white outfit, which had a bow at the back, leading to a long trail. She complimented the look with no makeup look, heart shaped earrings and studded stilettos. We only wish if the Simmba actress could have been a bit more experimental with her hair.
Ananya Panday
One thing we really like, is that Kiara’s been experimental with every look of her this year, and well this one has worked out really well too! The deep-neck Gauri & Nainika gown looked really well on the actress, and the hairdo just made her look more chic. A total thumbs up!
Deepika Padukone
Just when you’ll feel you’d have enough, Deepika Padukone is here to impress you with another outfit and leave you mesmerised. DP opted for a body fitted gown (without any thigh slits, thank god because clearly, we’ve had enough of that). The one-sided sleeve of the Alex Perry outfit, alongwith the long trail was perfectly complimented with her new short hair, and as always, take notes you guys!
Shahid Kapoor
Black and white, really seem to be Shahid’s colour. The actress after his recent appearance in a black and white printed suit, is back to impress you. This time decked up in a zebra print, Shahid Kapoor’s dapper attitude is what compliments his looks the best. This one just is another saga of it!
Kiara Advani
Kiara Advani’s latest fashion choices have left her massive fan base stunned lately. However, this time we’re left confused. From the floral print, to the sheer gown, with the thigh slit and the bow on one sided shoulder – there was too much in the single piece that we were left confused to what we should focus on. Honestly, we felt this wasn’t really ‘the Kiara level’.
Kartik Aaryan:
Kartik Aaryan hosted the Star Screen Awards in a deep blue blazer, and a well fitted pants of the same colour. The white shirt and striped bow, we feel, were too low for the glamour vibe. Aaryan should have adopted a little more stylish avatar, dodging the usuals.
Ranveer Singh:
Ranveer Singh has always left us in awe with his unique fashion statements. Remember the recent 80s look which clearly seemed to have taken over his ‘Satuday night fever’? That’s what we were expecting from him, rather than this usual embroidered silver suit. Clearly, the expectations from the actor are wayyyy high, blame it on him!
Ayushmann Khurrana:
We love how Ayushmann’s been trying to move ahead of the usuals and come up with something worth our while. While his complete white look at the Filmfare Glamour awards seemed to be a total trend setter, he seems to have gone a little overboard with the silver embroidery on the blazer.
Bhumi Pednekar
No offence, but we really feel Bhumi needs to change her stylist. While her recent appearances during the Pati Patni Aur Woh promotions grabbed eyeballs, the golden gown didn’t really suit her, specially the colour. Bhumi has posted another picture with a little different shade (thanks to the filters), and honestly just the change in colour seems to have made so much difference.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The B S Yediyurappa led Karnataka BJP has put itself in a commanding position in the Karnataka by-polls by leading in 11 out of the 15 assembly by-poll seats, News18 Kannada has reported.
The Congress which too contested all the 15 assembly seats is leading in two seats while the H D Kumaraswamy led JD(S) is leading on one.
Senior Congress leader D K Shivaumar was quoted as admitting defeat by claiming that the rebel MLAs have been accepted by the people.
This by-poll was necessitated after 15 Congress MLAs decided to rebel in the state which led to the dismissal of the Kumaraswamy led government. The rebels were later disqualified by the Supreme Court which led to the by-polls.
The BJP currently has 106 seats in the state and if the trends stand, it will comfortably surpass the majority mark of 113.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First Polio Case in Malaysia in 27 Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Malaysia registered the first case of polio in 27 years, the France Press reported, citing the Malaysian Ministry of Health.
A three-month-old baby, originally from the city of Tuaran in Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island, was admitted to a hospital with symptoms of fever and muscle weakness on Friday, the ministry said. The baby is treated in "an isolation ward and is in stable condition, but still requires assistance to breathe," Noor Hisham Abdullah, Director General of Health said in a statement.
In 2000, Malaysia was declared polio-free. The last case of the disease was registered in 1992.
Public health expert T. Jayabalan told AFP he was not surprised by the case, as poliovaccine is not mandatory in Malaysia.
“This first case probably is the tip of the iceberg. There is a very high possibility of a rising trend,” he warned.

The international award ceremony is set to hold in January, 2020, and Burna Boy has allayed the fears of his well-wishers, who are fervently hoping that he would become the first Nigerian to move past the nomination level, and actually bring the award home.
During a recent performance at international rapper, Cardi B’s concert, in Lagos, Nigeria, Burna Boy pledged he would bring the award home and after that there would be a cause for celebration.
In his words, he said:
Burna’s album African Giant, was nominated in the World Best Music Album, alongside fellow African legendary singer, Angelique Kidjo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DENR wants public, stakeholders to help solve garbage crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Benny Antiporda, Undersecretary for Solid Waste Management and Local Government Units Concerns, said Environment and Natural Resources  Secretary Roy Cimatu stressed that the  country, particularly Metro Manila, “is in the middle of a garbage crisis” and will need a concerted effort among all sectors to solve it.
“Solid waste management is not the government’s responsibility alone, it is everyone’s business,” Antiporda said.
Cimatu’s declaration came amid government efforts to revive the heavily polluted Manila Bay, which is the repository of trash and untreated sewage from households and businesses in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
“We shouldn’t wait for the time when there will be more trash than fish in the ocean,” said Antiporda, noting the situation will get worse without the efforts of everybody.
Antiporda added that LGUs  also play a crucial role in solid waste management having been tasked to ensure proper waste segregation and disposal under RA 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000.
Under this law, LGUs are required to come up with their respective 10-year Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP) and convert open dumpsites into sanitary landfills.
The NSWMC has already fast-tracked the approval of SWMPs of hundreds of LGUs nationwide, while the DENR closed down some open dumpsites and filed criminal and administrative charges against local officials allowing their operation.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha is gearing up for the release of Dabangg 3 alongside superstar Salman Khan. While she is busy promoting the film, she answered the biggest questio, to whether there will be a female Dabangg ever! Below is what she has to say.
During the promotions, Sonakshi spoke about how there are not enough producers who are willing to take risks with female-oriented films with the same budget as for a male one. This in turn led to the question of whether Dabangg will ever see a female cop.
“No. There’s still a long way to go. I’ve done so many solo lead films but the budgets are nowhere closer to what they are for the male superstars. Of course, that’s also because the returns that they get but then that depends on the audience,” Sonakshi told PTI
Sonakshi also stressed on how the audience also needs to bring in the change. If the audience is receptive of the films led by women the same way male ones enjoy, it is possible.
When asked if there are producers ready to bankroll such a film, Sonakshi said, “No there aren’t enough people to take that risk. Which is why it’s not happening.”
Talking about her character Rajjo, that she is rebooting for the third time, the actress said, “Rajjo will always be special to me because I began my career playing her. I can play Rajjo in my sleep. I just have to wear the saree, put on those flowers in my hair and I become her. I know the beats of Rajjo so well.”
Directed by Prabhudheva, Dabangg 3 starring Salman, Sonakshi and debutant Saiee Manjarekar and set to release on December 20 this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Under Executive Order 99 issued by Duterte on December 6, the 2019 Yuletide social assistance program will be created through an ordinance to be passed by the local legislative body.
“The Yuletide season is an opportune time to establish such measures or programs for the economic empowerment of barangay officials and functionaries, in recognition of their valuable and meaningful service that effect genuine and positive change in their respective communities,” the EO stated.
Duterte directed the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to jointly issue the appropriate guidelines such as the components of the program and the specific criteria and parameters for the determination of the qualified barangay officials and functionaries.
The expenses for the program will be charged against the barangay’s available funds.
For the succeeding years, the DILG, in consultation with the DBM, will have to study and propose measures for the provision of social assistance to qualified barangay officials and functionaries, as well as identify funding sources

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Consumers and companies alike require high quality electronic equipment to support everyday lives and more of these devices are now wireless enabled, writes ROHDE & SCHWARZ.
Technology is expected to support us in the office, homes, schools, hospitals and in our cars.  We expect connectivity everywhere and we expect it to work.  The importance of compatible operation among electronic devices and radios is critical to us as users and in the function of our businesses.  The growth of innovation is exponential and so is the expectation that devices will operate without fault or interference.
In addition, market surveillance authorities around the world are reviewing their activities as they come under more pressure to be stricter, with the aim to increase detection of products that fail to conform to rules on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and risk potential interference with other products or radio services.  The reasoning is clear: with more and more high-tech equipment in everyone’s cars and pockets, offices, and streets – and a society ever more reliant on their services to function safely and economically – it’s more important than ever that all these different devices can coexist harmoniously in close proximity to each other.
Moreover, market enthusiasm for wireless devices is putting increasing pressure on the available radio spectrum.  With the spread of the IoT, that pressure is expected to continue to rise.  It’s imperative that GSM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, Tetra, and other radios use the spectrum efficiently, with spectral awareness and minimum out-of-band emissions.  Coming over the horizon, new multi-radio equipped autonomous vehicles, home automation and the use of robotics will up the ante even more.
All electronic products must conform to international and national EMC and radio-equipment regulations.  Legislation is in force beyond the EU, including North American and Asian territories. Companies understand that technical compliance is only one part of the picture.  The associated administrative procedures and documentation that describes the tests that have been applied and supports the mandatory declarations of conformity must also be correct and kept up to date.
 
EMC Experts: In House and In the Community
EMC is an issue for companies’ engineering as well as compliance personnel.  Of course, each side has distinct goals and must rely on a different skillset and knowledge base to achieve them.
Engineers need a broad understanding of how to interpret and apply the technical regulations, and the techniques to use through design and testing to satisfy every applicable requirement.
Compliance personnel, for their part, must have a clear grasp of complex legislation and the numerous individual stipulations referenced by each standard.  Ensuring that declarations of conformity are correct and justified, and maintaining the documentation to support them, demands attention to detail and ongoing vigilance to maintain awareness as existing standards can be amended or replaced without notice.
Both groups can benefit from taking part in the growing community of EMC specialists active throughout the industry – from product design and marketing organisations, to contract test services, and test and measurement equipment suppliers.
 
Demystifying EMC
Returning for 2020, the 6th Demystifying EMC event will take place on Monday 10 February 2020 at the Silverstone Wing, in Northamptonshire. Presented by experts from a variety of organisations spanning the design, test and regulatory compliance spectrum, Demystifying EMC is established as one of the primary training events delivering high quality, free of charge training to the industry.  As with previous years, there will be five different tracks and sessions to choose from, and time in the day to network with peers, speak with industry experts and see demos.
On the day, Michael Derby of ACB Europe will explain more about how to get radio products approved, aided by Charlie Blackham of Sulis Consultants. They will discuss compliance issues concerning installing radio modules, EU RED and CE-Mark compliance, and how to satisfy FCC requirements when seeking acceptance in US markets.
Martin Wiles of Albatross Projects will look at the new CISPR EMC standards being finalised for radiated emissions measurements below 30 MHz using magnetic loops, and explore the feasibility of using and validating existing anechoic chambers under these conditions. This will be of particular interest to the automotive community, as well as other groups.  Tamara Monti of Dassault Systèmes will give insights into electric-drivetrain simulation, from the EMC standpoint, both at component and system level, and James Pawson of Unit 3 Compliance will provide a frank and down-to-“earth” perspective on ground issues.
Lee Hill of Silent Solutions will be back – giving the keynote titled ‘The five EMC things they didn’t put in your education’. He will also be presenting further presentations with practical applications and troubleshooting demonstrations throughout the day.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google on Friday added a range of new features to Google Assistant in an effort to simplify voice-enabled productivity.
“Starting to roll out today, you can use your Assistant to create and manage your notes and lists in Google Keep, Any.do, AnyList, or Bring! across Assistant-enabled phones and smart speakers,” the company said on its news blog.
Users can now enable support for third party list apps via the Assistant, where they can say things like “Hey Google, create a holiday gift list”. Additionally, users can use the Assistant to search for and listen to podcasts too.
“When you ask the Assistant for podcasts about a certain topic — ‘Hey Google, find a podcast about holiday cooking’ — it’ll suggest relevant episodes for you,” Google explained.
Meanwhile, users can also ask the Assistant to search for photos and share them directly by saying “Hey Google, look up photos from this weekend”.
According to Google, the new features are available on all Assistant-enabled phones.
In November, the company also released a news-reading Assistant feature in the United States.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka to use Wolbachia bacteria to control Aedes mosquitoes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By NewsDesk   @bactiman63
Sri Lankan health officials have reportedly taken steps to introduce Wolbachia bacteria into the environment starting in February.
The pilot project is to be carried out in Colombo and Nugegoda. Bacteria are to be released in 25 Grama Niladhari Divisions around Colombo, Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Health Dr. Paba Palihawadana said revealed at a media briefing in Colombo Saturday.
The bacteria will be introduced after years of laboratory testing and field testing.
The bacteria is being used successfully in 12 countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, the Pacific Islands, Vietnam, India, and Mexico.
Government officials say Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes are bred and in partnership with local communities, released them into areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases.When Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry Wolbachia, the bacteria competes with viruses like dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever reducing the transmission of the virus to the diseases.
Sri Lanka has recorded more than 85,000 dengue fever cases in 2019 to date.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dia Mirza Gets Candid About Managing Her Life Post Separation From Husband Sahil Sangha</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It came as a great shocker earlier this year when Dia Mirza called her relation off with her husband Sahil Sangha. She expressed her views on social media and didn’t forget to mention that the decision was mutual.
As soon Dia Mirza updated her followers about such an important decision of her life, there was a long list of speculations doing the rounds amongst netizens, spilling the reasons about the separation.
Now, in a recent interview with Hindustan Times, Dia opened up about her life post that ‘impactful’ decision. “Any major life change is challenging, painful and difficult but the work is cathartic. This is what helps you grow and keeps your pursuit of happiness alive,” she quotes.
Dia adds further quoting, “I am fortunate that the kind of work that I do gives me the opportunity to deal with the pain better. I want to just go out there and keep finding my voice and keep empowering myself and others.”
She also revealed her new production house titled One India Stories and told the story behind it. “I chose this name because one means everybody and India has my name. I want to backstories that connect to all of us, bring people together, influence and impact positive change to grow to learn and share that discovery and learning,” she quotes.
The former beauty queen also has a production company, Born Free Entertainment Private Limited, which she had launched along with her ex-husband Sahil Sangha in 2011.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Video: How angry fans threw bottles on stage at Cardi B’s concert</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was and still an uproar on social media following the so-called Ghanaian celebrities who were snubbed by American female rapper, Cardi B during her visit to Ghana over the weekend.
It wasn’t her inability to meet the so-called celebrities which were the disappointment of the day, the show also experienced some glitches and this got people who were eager to experience a lifetime concert.
Cardi B’s Livespot festival which was held at the Accra Sports Stadium experienced delays which compelled angry fans to throw bottles on the stage.
In videos making waves on the Internet, fans had to wait for over a period of 1 hour before the next performance and that led to the throwing of bottles on the stage.
Apparently, things were really not organised to meet the expectations of fans and music lovers who trooped into the stadium to watch various performances from top Ghanaian musicians as well as Cardi B.
Cardi B saved the night when she jumped on the stage and thrilled fans with her energetic performances with dancers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Ford Ranger is dressed up in carbon fiber</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever since the T6 Ford Ranger made its debut back in 2011, owners have been busy tricking it out, as well as dressing it up with countless modifications. From making them into 4x4 rigs, to classy road-going machines, it goes to show how customizable the Blue Oval's pick-up truck is.
But what if you preferred to completely deck out your own Ford Ranger with a plethora of carbon fiber trim? Then why not take a look at what Motion R has available for the T6 Ranger. Based in the United Kingdom, Motion R decided to extensively use carbon fiber reinforced plastic to decorate the pick-up truck.
From the front bumper, front wings, rear quarter panels, as well as the rear bumper; Motion R decked out the Ranger with the lightweight composite. This gives the pick-up truck a cool and an unmistakable look. Further complementing the Ranger's sleek carbon fiber appearance are the LED daytime running lights on the bumper, the huge carbon fiber hood, 'Motion R' carbon fiber front grill, and the 20-inch 'OR21' concave alloy wheels.
Aside from the carbon fiber upgrade, Motion R also installed several aerodynamic upgrades. These include a front splitter, a rear bumper upgrade with an integrated diffuser, and a tailgate spoiler for good measure.
Interior photos were not provided by Motion R. However, they did mention that also put carbon fiber dashboard trim that is available in either 2x2 weave or forged carbon. There's even a flat-bottomed steering wheel with perforated leather. Finally, an optional full nappa leather interior can be specified for the Ford Ranger.
Want to have your Ford Ranger fitted with plenty of carbon fiber goodies? You better cough up GBP 39,995 or about Php 2.670 million to have it done, and that doesn't come with the full nappa leather upholstery. Expensive, yes. But is it worth it? Chime in your comments below.

However, Ganados made it to the top 20.
South Africa’s Zozibini Tunzi won the 2019 Miss Universe title.  
The South African stunner was crowned by last year’s winner, Catriona Gray of the Philippines.
“The Palace lauds Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados for representing our country well in the Miss Universe pageant in Atlanta, Georgia, USA,” Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said.
“Ms. Ganados has given pride and glory to the Filipino nation by showcasing the unique beauty and talent of the Filipina.”
The 23-year-old’s “experience in joining the prestigious beauty pageant should add further to her development as a beauty queen,” Panelo noted.
“We wish her all the best in her future endeavors,” the Palace official said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Check out Forbes top five earning African American musicians in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Musicians are known for their contributions to the music industry and one would think with the release of Forbes world top earning musicians of 2019, their wealth would stem only from their music.
However, most of these top earning musicians have capitalised on their fame, success in the industry and their esteemed brands to venture into other businesses.
Forbes considers all other streams of income tied to the artiste to curate the list and mostly looks at earnings before tax and payments to lawyers, managers or agents.
“To determine our rankings, we consider income from touring, music and outside business ventures with the help of Pollstar, Nielsen Music and interviews with industry insiders including many of the stars themselves,” Forbes reports.
The top 10 highest paid musicians in the world this year earned a little over $1 billion as compared to $886 million from last year. The figures, according to Forbes, were calculated from June 2018 to June 2019.
This remarkable feat goes a long way in revealing how some of the most popular and most sought-after musicians are cashing in on the industry.
Here’s a list of the top five African American musicians who made it to the top 10.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DOTr opens Cavite-Manila ferry route</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade announced that passengers may start using the ferry service from the Cavite City Port Terminal going to the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex in Pasay City, and to the Liwasang Bonifacio Terminal (Plaza Lawton) in Manila, and vice versa.
“Andito kami ngayon dahil hangarin namin na ilunsad at i-revive ang ferry operation ng Cavite. Itong operation ng Cavite ay matagal ding nawala, matagal ding nakalimutan, kaya sabi namin, umpisahan, buhayin, at itaguyod ulit ‘yung ferry operation ng Cavite,” Tugade said.
The transportation chief also announced more good news: the riding public will get to avail of the ferry service for free until 9 January 2020, in coordination with Shogun Ships Co. Inc. and Seaborne Shipping Company Inc.
“Kausap ko ‘yung Shogun, Seaborne, ang sabi ko, ‘itong proyektong ito, gusto ko pamaskong handog sa mga Cavite, dapat ito libre. Hanggang matapos ang Kapaskuhan sa January 9, libre ang pamasahe sa ferry. Ito ‘yung pamaskong handog ng administrasyong Duterte sa inyo,”  Tugade said.
Immediately following the launch, the ferry service kicked off its operations with an inaugural voyage from the Cavite City Port Terminal to the Liwasang Bonifacio Terminal (Lawton) in Manila. Upon arrival, it was announced that passengers who will ride the “MV Island Sabtang” will get free rides until January 31, 2020.
Two vessels will start operating tomorrow, with two to three more to be added next month to serve the routes.  
Through the ferry service, travel time from Cavite City Port Terminal to Liwasang Bonifacio Terminal is estimated at 40 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, travel time between the Cavite City Port Terminal and CCP, and vice versa, is around 15 minutes.
MV Island Sabtang from Shogun Ships Co. Inc. can accommodate 57 passengers, while MB Seaborne Mercury can accommodate 27 passengers. Fares for both rides are still under negotiation, as Secretary Tugade continues to push for lower prices.
For his part, Cavite City Mayor Bernardo Paredes thanked the DOTr and its attached agencies under the maritime sector for initiating the ferry service in a bid to help ease road traffic to and from Metro Manila.
“Sa ngalan ng ating pamahalaan at mamamayan ng ating siyudad, ang inyo pong lingkod ay lubos na nagagalak at nagpapasalamat sa inyong presensya upang matunghayan ang opisyal na pagbubukas ng Cavite-Manila Ferry Service. Ang nasabing proyekto ay makapagbibigay ng alternatibong pamamaraan ng transportasyon na tutugon sa ating kasalukuyang suliranin sa trapiko, na bago tayo makarating sa Metro Manila ay mag-uubos tayo ng mga 2-3 oras, ngayon, mga 40 minutes na lang,” Paredes said.
The Cavite-Manila Ferry Service is an offshoot of the “water jeepney” concept that was developed in Cebu, and was announced during the operational dry run of the Sangley Airport in Cavite. Secretary Tugade hopes that the riding public will utilize the service, as it offers a quick, convenient, and comfortable mode of transportation.
“Binubuhay natin ang konsepto ng ‘water jeepney’ sa Cavite, at sana po tangkilikin ninyo, para masabi natin, ‘okay ka, ferry ko’,” Tugade added.
Aside from the ferry service, the DOTr and MARINA also launched high priority maritime-related projects, such as the registration of recreational boats to boost tourism, and the opening of the MARINA Central Office Processing Center at the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange for the benefit of Filipino seafarers.  
Regular fare for Manila-Cavite City is P160, P128  for students, P114 for seniors and PWDs, and P80 for children below 4 years old.  While Manila-CCP Complex will be P200 for regular passenger, P180 for students, P143 for seniors and PWDs, and P128 for children below 4 years old.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fans react as Philip Schofield shares video of Holly Willoughby amid feud</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans have reacted to Philip Schofield’s most recent tweet, as the presenter shared a video of himself and Holly Willoughby amid rumours of a day time TV “civil war.”
According to claims, a number of ITV staff have complained about Philip within the organisation.
Phillip has ignored rumours of potential feuds in order to share the video, which shares the news that he and Holly are up for a Telly Talks award.
The Sun claims that This Morning’s Friday presenter Ruth Langsford has made an official complaint against Philip.
They also allege that Holly’s relationship with Philip has become strained in recent months.
Reports claim that Holly felt embarrassed by Philip’s social media behaviors.
A source told The Sun said: “Holly felt it was inappropriate that Phillip was posting videos of her on social media drinking shots of alcohol, but felt too nervous to speak to him directly about it.”
‘So someone at their agents YMU spoke to Phillip who accepted Holly’s decision. But it just shows things can become strained between them. But they find a way to work it out.’
Philip has apparently ignored the rift rumours in sharing the tweet, and fans are not happy.
“Not even an explanation or an apology for his biased unprofessional behavior. He needs sacking,” said one follower.
“Any response to the outcry? Are you not ashamed?,” said another.
However, some shared their support for the presenter.
One fan wrote: “People dont know him. Who knows what the truth is. I think people need to concentrate on their own life before talking about someone else when they have no idea what the truth is. Leave the poor bloke alone.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Some online speculation about Trevor Deely's disappearance is "outrageous", sister says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The sister of Trevor Deely has said some of the online speculation about her brother's disappearance is "outrageous" and needs to be toned down "several notches".
22-year-old Trevor went missing from Dublin city centre on December 7th 2000.
He was last seen on CCTV in the early hours of the morning after attending a work Christmas party.
Over the weekend, gardaí issued a fresh appeal for information on the 19th anniversary of Trevor's disappearance - saying that even the smallest piece of information may assist the investigation.
Speaking on the Pat Kenny Show today, Trevor's sister Michele says the family has kept trying different ways to find Trevor but they keep 'coming up blank'.
She observed: "We've done a huge amount of work... but all that work, in a way, is coming to haunt us - it's really becoming a very difficult item for the family when we think about speculation."
Michele said speculation does happen in the media, but it's "rare" - suggesting that it's the online speculation that needs to "come down several notches".
She observed: "You'd want to read what people write online - it is outrageous.
"At some stage I do think there has [...] something - I don't if it's a ruling or something [like that] - that doesn't allow that occur.
She added: "There's lots of theories - [like] Trevor went to Alaska, got caught up in something and somebody followed him back and did something to him.
"He was a simple guy... he was an entry level IT worker. And [yet] people have him caught up in this banking scam... [or] that he was involved in some crazy scheme, and that's why he was taken. It's crazy."
Michele added that she's been rejected by multiple social media companies when she's brought the concerns to them.
She told Pat: "I battle a lot to get the right facts out there, but it's actually really difficult."
Michele said there have been 'hundreds, if not thousands' of potential witnesses with potential sightings over the years.
She explained: "You never know when you're going to get a story that actually is true... and it could be the worst thing ever.
"Trevor would never give up on us - that's our commitment. As difficult as it is to deal with the speculation... we won't give up. We have to keep fighting through it until we find him."
CCTV footage, which you can see below, shows the last known movements of Trevor Deely.
Footage of the rear entrance of the premises at 3:35am shows an unknown man talking with Trevor at the back gate.
This man has never been identified.
Trevor was last seen on CCTV passing the since-removed Bank of Ireland ATM on Haddington Road at 4.14am.
Around 30 seconds later, a man was captured on CCTV walking in the same direction as Trevor.
Gardaí at Pearse Street Garda station are appealing for any information that could assist the investigation into Trevor's disappearance.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Pearse Street Garda station on 01-666-9000, the Garda Confidential Line at 1800-666-111 or Crimestoppers on 1800-250-025.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antec Performance P120 Crystal Case Now Available</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antec has just released the new P120 Crystal PC case. It aims to be a competitive mid-tower for just 99 EUR (MSRP inc VAT). It’s ticking all the right boxes for a PC gaming build too. It features two sides of tempered glass, plentiful radiator and fan mounting space, and room for a massive GPU.
What I really love is that it features a vertical GPU mount with support for a triple-slot card. That means that even the most beastly GPUs on the market today can be mounted on their side.
Users can install VGA cards with a length of up to 450 mm and CPUs with a maximum height of 185 mm as well as PSUs with a maximum length of 294 mm.
The new P120 Crystal measures 475 x 232 x 480 mm. Build from 0.8 mm and 1 mm steel and finished with tempered glass front and side panels. It’s a great looking case, and as well made as rival offerings.
The mid-tower model features large interior space for E-ATX, ATX, micro-ATX and ITX motherboards. The isolated power supply chamber and drive cages are positioned on top of the chassis. The sleek tower offers space for two 2.5” or 3.5″ HDDs and two 2.5″ SDDs and seven horizontal and three vertical expansion slots. To keep its cool, the P120 offers space for three 120 mm or two 140mm case fans at the bottom, one 120 or 140 mm fan in the rear as well as up to three 120 mm or two 140mm case fans on the side of the chassis.
The Antec P120 Crystal is available now from Amazon in the UK and many other PC retailers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Editor Rating: THROWBACKUser Rating: n/a - 0% (0)
The year was almost set to end on a high note. And yet yesterday, news broke that Chicago rapper Juice WRLD had passed away after suffering from a seizure at an airport. The sudden shock sent the entire music industry into disarray, with homages stemming from fans, friends, and collaborators alike. With circumstances surrounding his death remaining mysterious as of this moment, many looked to seek solace in his music. With a catalog ranging in different styles, some of his more melancholic and emotional-driven songs proved to be particularly powerful in retrospect.
In many ways, his response to XXXTentacion and Lil Peep's death "Legends" feels like a fitting tribute. Especially given the eerily accurate moments of foreshadowing, in which Juice reimagines the "27 Club" as the "21 Club," mirroring his own fate with startling accuracy. "We ain't making it past 21," he sings, over haunting production from TakeADayTrip and Russel Chen. Given the circumstances, it might not be easy to listen to "Legends," but it remains notable in its prophetic nature. Perhaps someone will pick up where he left off and pen a similar tribute in his honor. Rest in peace, Juice WRLD.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Senator Bong Go, MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim, Department of Transportation (DOTr)  Secretary Arthur Tugade, Department of Environment Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Roy Cimatu and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno were present during the ceremony at 10 a.m.
“The Pasig River ferry service has been an alternative mode of transport for Metro Manila commuters who want to avoid the busy streets of Metro Manila. They can enjoy ferry rides between Pasig City and Manila for free until the end of January ,” said Lim.
“With the government’s collective effort and President Duterte’s order, Pasig River is now clean from floating garbage so aside from the ferry service being an alternative mode of transport, commuters can now enjoy the beauty of the river while on cruise,” Go added.
Go encouraged the concerned government officials to find ways and source funds for it to be free until the end of 2020.  He added that the renewed beauty of the 25-kilometer river will attract more ferry service passengers.
According to Lim, the free ferry transportation program hopes to encourage the public to patronize the ferry service over public utility vehicles and avoid the hassles of commuting in congested Metro Manila roads. Commuters will be accommodated on a first-come, first-served basis.
In preparation for the re-launch, Lim ordered the refurbishment of ferry stations and the sourcing of additional boats to further serve passengers better.
Lim also thanked the local chief executives of Metro Manila for their support to the project, especially Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto who provided two newly procured ferry boats which are now part of the PRFS fleet.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tap Back, who dominated 10 rivals in the Nov. 1 Golden State Juvenile at Santa Anita Park, is among 11 nominees to continue in California-bred company Sunday in Los Alamitos' $100,000 King Glorious Stakes.
Meanwhile, double stakes winner Been Studying Her tops the 15 2-year-old fillies nominated to the $100,000 Soviet Problem a day prior in southern California.
Both races are at one mile and restricted to Cal-breds.
Owned by co-breeder Richard Barton and trained by Jeff Bonde, Tap Back won the Golden State Juvenile by six lengths at 14-1, the second victory in four starts for the son of Einstein and the Tapit mare Tap Tap Ur It. He’s earned $163,100.
Trainer Doug O’Neill, who won the King Glorious in both 2015 (Found Money) and 2016 (Ann Arbor Eddie), has a pair of nominees – I Will Not and Rookie Mistake. Both are owned by breeder J. Paul Reddam’s Reddam Racing LLC.
A son of Square Eddie, I Will Not is 1-for-4 with a bankroll of $38,262 while Rookie Mistake, another Square Eddie colt, is a thrice-defeated maiden coming off a runner-up finish at Del Mar Dec. 1. He’s earned $18,551.
The other nominees, in alphabetical order, are Club Aspen, Dapper, Govenor Cinch, If Id Told You, Papster, Pas de Panique, Side Street Dave and Totally Tiger.
Owned by KMN Racing LLC and trained by Hall of Famer Jerry Hollendorfer, who won the 2016 Soviet Problem with Sircat Sally, Been Studying Her was an easy winner of the Golden State Juvenile Fillies as the 3-2 choice Nov. 1.
The daughter of Fast Anna and the Kitten’s Joy mare Maddie’s Odyssey is undefeated in non-graded races. Her other stakes win came in the Generous Portion Aug. 28.
Fourth in the Grade I Chandelier taken by eventual Starlet winner Bast, Been Studying Her has earned $205,280.
The remaining nominees, in alphabetical order, are Almost a Factor, Bella Renella, Bulletproof One, California Kook, Cholula Lips, Jodie Faster, Nocherylikemychery, Phoenix Tears, Say Yes Sally, Slew’s Screen Star, Smiling Shirlee, Sofi’s Gold, Warren’s Showtime and Warrior’s Moon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Boston Celtics player fined for not looking at Chinese flag during national anthem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A FRENCH FORMER NBA player has been reprimanded and fined $1,400 by sports officials in China for not looking at the Chinese flag during the national anthem before a game.
Players with the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) are supposed to stare at the national symbol during the “March of the Volunteers”, but television images showed Guerschon Yabusele, who plays for Nanjing Tongxi Monkey King, had his head down before Friday’s game.
Yabusele was given a “serious warning” and a 10,000-yuan fine for not looking at the flag as required, the CBA said in a statement on Saturday.
Yabusele, who played forward for the Boston Celtics for two seasons before joining the CBA team this year, has not commented on the incident.
China’s government has stepped up the promotion of patriotism under President Xi Jinping, with legislation approved in 2017 to punish anyone who disrespects the national anthem with up to three years in prison.
Opinions on Yabusele’s punishment were divided on Chinese social media.
“He’s happy to take money from China, but he doesn’t respect it,” one person wrote on the popular Weibo social media platform.
“This player must be expelled immediately and his club must be disqualified from the championship,” another said.
But many found the sanction to be harsh.
“It’s nonsense. First, he’s not Chinese. Moreover, he stood up and didn’t make any insulting gesture,” one person wrote.
“He has his head down. So what? In what era does the CBA live? It’s 50 years behind.”
Yabusele is not the first foreign athlete to break patriotic rules in China. Last year, Shandong Luneng’s Brazilian midfielder Diego Tardelli was handed a one-game ban for rubbing his face during the anthem before a game.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Ozzy Osbourne has offered a $25,000 reward for the return of his late friend Randy Rhoads’ stolen guitars.
The 71-year-old rocker took to social media to offer the reward for information leading to an arrest in the case and the return of the items, which were stolen from the Musonia School of Music in North Hollywood, California last month (November 2019), reports aceshowbiz.com.
Sharing photographs of the stolen instruments on Instagram, the Black Sabbath rocker wrote: “As many of you have heard, the Musonia School of Music in N. Hollywood, CA (the school where Randy Rhoads famously taught guitar) was viciously robbed on Thanksgiving night.”
“Musonia was run by Randy’s late mother, Delores, and after his death 37 years ago, the school became something of a pilgrimage to his fans from all over the world. It is a place where the Rhoads Family happily opened their hearts to share the life of Randy.”
“As you can imagine, the items that were stolen, including Randy’s first electric guitar, are irreplaceable to the Rhoads Family.”
Osbourne then shared he was personally “heartbroken” over the thefts and the damage caused at the school by the trespassing thieves.
Rhoads learned to play guitar at Musonia, which is now run by his brother, Kelle Rhoads. The school also doubles up as the Randy Rhoads Museum.
The young star was killed in 1982, at the age of 25, when the small plane in which he was a passenger crashed after clipping Osbourne’s tour bus in Leesburg, Florida. Two others died during the tragic incident.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Isko wants Manila to end ‘endo’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In his speech at yesterday’s regular flag-raising ceremony in City Hall, Moreno said he would want to make Manila ‘the number one implementor with regard the government campaign to finish ‘endo.’
The mayor said he has already promoted about 500 employees since he assumed mayorship on June 30, adding that it had been the city govenment’s policy to give priority to JOs or ‘job order personnel’ so they can become permanent employees.
‘Pag pinipirmahan ko appointment, di ako nagkakaroon ng kwentada sa kaisipan.  Sa loob ng limang buwan, naging polisiya ko nang bigyang prayoridad ang mga JO na maging permanent.  Halos inaabot ako ng madaling araw sa pagpirma,’ Moreno said.
Stressing he wants to provide certainty and security in the minds of JO personnel, Moreno cited a case where the JO was found to have been serving for 27 years already.
‘Ibig sabihin, 54 times na siyang nagpapapirma ng  papel. Ganun din, 54 times na siyang nangamba. Imagine that kind of life, that kind of emotion,’ he said.
Moreno assured the city employees that he will be fair in the manner of promotion, citing length of service and  if the applicant is qualified as the top considerations.
JOs are similarly-situated with contractual employes in private companies in that their employment is good for only six months subject to renewal if their services are still needed. ‘Endo’ refers to end of contract.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Remembering Juice WRLD's Art Of Freestyling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday morning, the loss of Jarad Anthony Higgins, known to millions of fans as Juice WRLD, sent a ripple effect through the community. Fellow artists and listeners alike penned eulogies and homages, highlighting the impact of his creativity and content. For many, his emo-inspired take on rap bridged the gap between genre barriers, widening the scope of his impact to a variety of demographics. And while many of his more popular singles ranging from “Robbery,” “Lucid Dreams,” and “All Girls Are The Same” centered around melancholic melodies, Juice’s sensibilities as an emcee garnered a unique type of respect from his contemporaries.
In a heartfelt Instagram post, fellow lyricist YBN Cordae paid respects to his friend, highlighting a commonality between them. “We shared the same bus,(your bus lol) and never slept cuz we'd be up freestyling for HOURS,” he wrote. “Since then a lifelong brotherhood was built.” A bond forged through a mutual appreciation for hip-hop music and the art of lyricism, Juice WRLD and Cordae’s friendship served to highlight one of the former’s status as a student of the game. If it wasn’t always apparent from his musical choices, his admiration and aptitude for the act of freestyling was proof in itself. His sheer prowess in that department was enough to make a believer out of hip-hop media’s favorite stoic, Funkmaster Flex. The old-head archetype in his final form, Flex’s face could only contort with pleasure as Juice delivered bar-after-bar, many of which appeared to be rattled off-top.
While Juice WRLD’s prolific work ethic led to many musical memories preserved, perhaps none shine brighter than his impressive stop on Tim Westwood TV. In a clip that has since garnered over five million views, Juice WRLD rapped for fifty-two minutes straight over some of Eminem’s most popular beats, going completely off the dome. A feat that not many emcees would dare attempt, let alone pull off with quotables to match. For many, this video will serve as a reminder of Juice’s talent, of what separated him from others in his class. To be sitting on such keen lyrical instincts, using them sparingly and thus, making them all the more impressive. His preservation of a seemingly lost art--the unwritten freestyle--speaks to a mentality well beyond his years. Clearly, Juice WRLD held an appreciation for the culture’s foundational roots and his predecessors.
The aforementioned “hour-long freestyle” has been embedded below, a bittersweet reminder of the young man’s legacy. Between the flow-switches, eerily foreshadowing lyrics, the palpable sense of fun, and the endearing lulls as he concocts his next move, Juice’s freestyle clinic may very well stand as a defining artistic moment. Even when his lyrics bridge the topic of death, which certainly hurts given the circumstances, his clear sense of enjoyment is a strong enough counterweight. Rest in peace, Juice WRLD. One of the best freestylers we’ve seen in recent memory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Davis scores season-high 50 points as Lakers beat Timberwolves</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ANTHONY DAVIS SCORED 50 points to power the Los Angeles Lakers to a 142-125 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday that gave the Western Conference leaders the best record in the NBA.
Davis unleashed his aggression to notch the fourth 50-point game of his career and his first with the Lakers.
He connecting on 20 of 29 shots from the field — with 16 baskets in the paint and not a single three-pointer.
“One for the ages,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.
“The first thing that stands out to me was he had four steals, a block and great defense for all 39 minutes he was out there,” Vogel said. “To be able to perform on that end of the floor and anchor us and still go for 50 in what I feel is an old-school, smashmouth way of getting 50.
Davis, a perfect 10 of 10 from the free-throw line, also pulled down seven rebounds and handed out six assists.
“I just came out aggressive, playing hard,” said Davis, who laid in a floater with 4:39 left to play to reach 50 points for the night. “My team-mates did a good job of finding me.”
LeBron James added 32 points with 13 assists despite finding himself in foul trouble with four in the first half.
Alex Caruso chipped in 16 points as the Lakers improved to 21-3.
Eight Minnesota players scored in double figures.
Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins scored 19 apiece and the Timberwolves led by five late in the second quarter. Ultimately, however, they had no answer for Davis.
In Miami, rookie Tyler Herro scored 27 points and made a go-ahead three-pointer with 38.2 seconds left in overtime to lift the Heat to a 110-105 victory over the Chicago Bulls.
Herro’s heroics included a three-pointer with 7.1 seconds left in regulation, which ended with the score tied at 97-97.
He made three more from beyond the arc in the extra session — including one to tie the game and one to give the Heat the lead for good as Miami improved to 10-0 at home this season and 17-6 overall.
“My team-mates trusted me with the ball,” the 19-year-old reserve guard said. “Every time I get a shot, I have confidence.”
In Dallas, Luka Doncic scored 27 points with seven rebounds and eight assists for his 19th straight game of at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists.
He passed NBA icon Michael Jordan for the most such games in a row since the NBA/ABA merger in the 1970s, but it wasn’t enough to deliver a victory for the Mavs, who fell 110-106 to the Sacramento Kings.
Doncic missed a potential game-tying basket with 7.7 seconds remaining as Sacramento thwarted a late Mavericks rally.
Nemanja Bjelica, who led the Kings with 30 points, closed out the scoring with a layup after Richaun Holmes grabbed the rebound of Doncic’s miss.
Buddy Hield added 26 points for the Kings, former Maverick Harrison Barnes had 13 and Holmes chipped in 12.
The Los Angeles Clippers bounced back from an embarrassing 28-point loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday with a 135-119 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for the Clippers as they improved to 1-1 in their six-game road trip.
“We just wanted to come in and execute,” Leonard said. “Last game, we played very sluggish on the offensive end.
“It’s really not about missing shots or making shots, it’s about getting into our offense and executing and making the right play.”
Paul George added 27 points as five Clippers players scored in double figures. Montrezl Harrell added nine of his 20 in the fourth quarter to help Los Angeles put away the determined Wizards.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a statement issued on Monday,  overall rate for a typical household consuming 200kWh increased to P9.8623 per kWh this December from last month’s P9.5579 per kWh. The adjustment of P0.3044 per kWh will mean an increase of around P61 in the typical household’s total electricity bill.
Despite the adjustment, electricity rate this month is still around P0.70 per kWh lower than in April 2019.
From P5.0317 per kWh last month, the generation charge for December increased to P5.1967 per kWh, an upward adjustment of P0.1650 per kWh.
Charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) increased by P1.0799 per kWh driven by tighter supply conditions in the Luzon grid. As a result, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) placed the Luzon Grid on Yellow Alert on two occasions.  The average capacity on outage in November increased by 525 MW because of scheduled and forced outages of some power plants and the natural gas supply restriction of Malampaya onshore gas plant implemented by SPEX from November 10 to 14. The share of WESM to Meralco’s supply needs was reduced to 10%.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was learned that the BI has entered into a memorandum of agreement with the service provider for the pilot testing of the e-gates, initially at the NAIA 2 immigration departure area.
Bi spokesperson Dana Sandoval said the e-gate system was implemented last year in the immigration arrival areas of NAIA’s three terminals and the international airports in Mactan-Cebu, Davao, and Clark.
The noticeable drop in incidence of long queues at the airports has been attributed to the successful implementation of the project, she said, adding that just like in the case of e-gates installed at the immigration arrival areas, the new lanes shall cater only to departing OFWs in order to ensure smoother and faster processing for these Filipinos in recognition of their contributions to the country’s economic development.
BI port operations division chief Grifton Medina, said the project’s pilot testing and demonstration would last for six months and that the BI is targeting to process at least  100,000 passengers before the project could become fully operational.
Medina said the project’s entire cost will be shouldered by the company that supplied the country’s e-gates.
Medina added that the service provider has committed to initially install and operate two e-gates and biometric machines at NAIA’s Terminal 2 for exclusive use of departing overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and airline crew of Philippine Airlines (PAL).

Talking to the media in Sialkot on Sunday, she said that what an irony it is that Opposition leaders are devising a policy to protect their corruption, while sitting in London.
The special assistant said that first former prime minister Nawaz Sharif refuted the ownership of his London apartments and now he is presiding over party meeting there, adding that the law and courts were summoning them but the Sicilian Mafia is refusing to return to Pakistan.
Dr Firdous said wrong economic policies of the PML-N government had ruined Pakistan s economy and now the PTI government is taking coarse correction, adding that the paper companies of PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif inflicted a loss of billions of rupees on country s economy.
“They cannot befool the people of Pakistan anymore,” she added.
Firdous urged the opposition, especially the PML-N, to come to the parliament to discuss and solve the problems being faced by the common man.
“The government is committed to resolve people s problems under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan,” the special assistant said and added Imran Khan is striving hard to take the country to new heights of progress and development.
She said improved economic indicators show that the economy is progressing on the right path.

Cardi B was slated to have a  meet and greet session with some Ghanaian celebrities at 2:30 pm yesterday ahead of her stadium concert but things didn’t go as planned.
This caused the celebrities to take to social media to vent out their displeasure of waiting in vain for the American star. The likes  of Afia Schwarzenegger, Hajia4real amongst others took a swipe at Cardi B for keeping them waiting while eating Khebab.
Cardi B finally came out to meet with the celebrities  and apologized for keeping them waiting explaining that she was not in the known that she had a meet and greet session.
As predictable as Akuapem poloo is, she didn’t hold back in showing off her twerking skills to Cardi B who joined her in dancing.
As the dancing was going on, Akuapem poloo’s wig came off and she quickly took it and run off causing a loud laughter among the audience present.
Well the most important thing is, Akuapem poloo finally had the chance to meet her mentor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Freeland heads to Mexico in effort to finalize new NAFTA revisions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA — Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland is to meet American and Mexican officials in Mexico City on Tuesday amid reports a deal to revise the new North American free-trade agreement is close to completion.
The federal government revealed Freeland's itinerary late Monday following a day of furious speculation about the state of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal — and concerns from Canada's aluminum sector about what the agreement could mean for the industry and workers.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump talked directly about the deal Monday, Trudeau's office reported, without details.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement was signed by the three countries last year, but U.S. ratification has been stalled for months as congressional Democrats and organized labour have bickered with Mexico over labour rights as well as the agreement's treatment of steel and aluminum.
There were concerns the agreement, which aims to update the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, would not be approved before Congress disperses until 2020 and its focus shifts to next fall's presidential election.
Freeland was cautious Monday amid chatter of an imminent deal.
"In the lives of ordinary Canadians, there is perhaps no issue in our relationship with the United States that matters more than trade," she said in question period.
"The prime minister raised the ratification of the new NAFTA and other trade issues in his meeting last week with the president and we have been working intensively, including many conversations over the weekend and this morning with our American partners, on getting the deal finalized."
Trump weighed in Monday, saying: "I'm hearing very good things, including from unions and others that it’s looking good. I hope they put it up to a vote, and if they put it up to a vote, it’s going to pass.
"I'm hearing a lot of strides have been made over the last 24 hours, with unions and others."
The breakthrough appears to have followed Mexico accepting — with a five-year phase-in period — a U.S. demand to tighten the definition of North American steel in a section of the agreement dealing with where cars and their parts can be said to originate.
Products that officially originate in North America get more favourable treatment than ones that originate abroad but come through one of the countries in the agreement.
However, Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his country would not accept the same tighter definition for aluminum because the raw materials are not produced in Mexico.
Mexico also rejected U.S. demands for American inspectors to be sent in to ensure Mexican auto workers are being paid $16 per hour on average, though U.S. officials were said to have accepted Mexico's offer to allow dispute-resolution panels to review labour-law compliance.
Labour unions in the U.S. were to be briefed on the proposed amendments on Monday with the hope they would agree to the changes, which would pave the way for the Democratic leaders to offer their own approval.
The Trump administration as well as the Canadian and Mexican governments would then be asked to agree formally to the amended deal before introducing legislation to put it into force.
Details of the amendments had yet to be communicated to Canadian industry and labour groups Monday, but those representing the aluminum sector and its workers were upset the deal may not include a tighter definition on what constitutes North American aluminum.
"We're certainly not happy with this at all because it simply means Mexico wants to keep an open door to foreign metal coming in from China, from the Middle East, from India," said Aluminum Association of Canada president Jean Simard.
Noting the industry was battered by U.S. tariffs last year, Simard added: "Canada has taken the case of aluminum as much as steel up to now and we certainly expect Minister Freeland and the Canadian government to hold their position on this like they've been doing up to now."
Ken Neumann, national director in Canada of the United Steelworkers union, which represents employees in both the aluminum and steel industries, was also critical of Mexico's demand for a five-year phase-in period for tightening the definition of North American steel.
"We strongly would anticipate or hope that our government is going to stand up for our aluminum workers," he said.
"So we're going to keep our fingers crossed. We're going to consult with the government of Canada to make sure they're going to stand up for what's right for the steel industry and for our aluminum workers."
Neumann and other members of the United Steelworkers' leadership team in Canada were scheduled to fly to the U.S. to be briefed Tuesday on details of the proposed amendments.
"At this stage of the game, all eyes are on where organized labour is on Mexico's newest proposals," said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with law firm Dickinson Wright and an expert in Canada-U.S. trade. "If they agree, it's likely House (of Representatives) Democrats will sign off on this."
Yet while there is a chance that legislation could be introduced this week and passed by Congress before Dec. 20 to bring the deal into force, Ujczo warned there still could be unexpected hurdles.
"Nobody has seen the implementing bill soup-to-nuts," he said. "So we're closing Phase 1 of the deal process, then we're on to Phase 2, which will be we'll all have to take a look at the implementing bill."
The new trade pact would replace NAFTA, which came into force in 1994 and eliminated most tariffs and other trade barriers involving the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Critics, including Trump, labour unions and many Democratic lawmakers, branded NAFTA a job-killer for America because it encouraged factories to move south of the border, capitalize on low-wage Mexican workers and ship products back to the U.S. duty-free.
Mexico ratified the new North American deal in June while the Canadian government has said it is waiting to ratify the agreement at the same time as the United States.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rugby Australia has played down one of its most tumultuous years, preferring to laud the fact the majority of its social media followers approved of the new Wallabies coach – Dave Rennie.
The peak body in Australia issued a statement following its final board meeting of the year in Sydney on Monday but it barely touched on the long-running Israel Folau saga.
Last Wednesday Rugby Australia apologised to and reached a settlement with Folau over his sacking, following an Instagram post which said “hell awaits” gay people.
Chief executive Raelene Castle said the settlement amount was confidential but described reports – some of which were as high as $8 million – as “wildly inaccurate”.

In Monday’s statement RA chairman Cameron Clyne only mentioned the Folau issue and potential hurdles with a new pay television deal in the last three paragraphs of the 528-word statement.
Rugby Australia Chairman, Cameron Clyne said: “The Rugby World Cup in Japan was enjoyed over 40,000 Australian travellers – second only behind English fans as the most to attend the tournament. The World Cup also gave Australian Rugby its highest representation of match officials since 2003 with both Angus Gardner and Nic Berry taking the whistle.
“The hard work has already begun for the Wallabies as we build towards France 2023, and we are excited for the future after securing Dave Rennie as the new Wallabies Head Coach.
“It was encouraging to see the Rugby community embrace Dave’s appointment with 86% of Facebook followers and 70% of Instagram followers reacting positively to the news last month.
Clyne highlighted positive developments in player contracting with a host of talented youngsters signing on with Australian Rugby, and continued participation growth across each format.
“The Junior Wallabies came within a point of bringing home the Under 20’s World Cup, and then our Schools & Under 18s team completed an undefeated tour of New Zealand. Importantly, the vast majority of these young stars of the future have been secured in our game long term,” he said.
“The Buildcorp Wallaroos played more Tests than ever before this year and against this backdrop, women’s participation experienced double-digit growth for the third consecutive year.
“As we look towards the 2020 Olympic Games the sevens format is continuing to grow in popularity, with 41 spring and summer competitions kicking off across the country over the past two months.
“Over 30 clubs ran our new Get into Rugby program in clubs in 2019, introducing hundreds of new players of all ages to the game by giving them a sample of each of our three formats – fifteens, sevens and Touch 7s.”
Clyne also addressed recent media speculation surrounding the position of Chief Executive, Raelene Castle and the game’s current media rights negotiations.
“Raelene’s position is not in question and the Board is united behind the process undertaken with Israel Folau.
“2020 is an important year with the broadcast rights negotiations underway and we remain in dialogue with our long-term partner Fox Sports as we aim to deliver the strongest levels of coverage for all of our competitions over the next five-year cycle,” said Clyne.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Puzzle As Jowie Allegedly Transferred To Voi, Parents Question Motive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jowie Irungu, the prime suspect in the brutal murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani has allegedly been transferred from Kamiti Maximum Prison Security Prison under unclear circumstances.
According to Nation, the family of Irungu learnt of his transfer very late on Friday, December 6 and could not confirm it as the prison only allowed visits during the weekdays.
They therefore had to wait until Monday, December 9, where they were told that he had been transferred on Friday.
His mother, Anastacia stated that upon visiting the prison, the officer in charge said that he had been transferred to Manyani Maximum Security Prison in Voi, Taita Taveta County.

According to the mother, he was allegedly moved on Friday, an action that has left the family confused over the motive behind it, as they claim they were not aware of such development.
Anastacia has also stated that the family lawyer representing Jowie denied being aware of the transfer, despite the prison authorities insisting that it was a normal transfer.
“The prison officer says it’s a normal transfer but our lawyer says he has never heard of something like that. He has been taken to Manyani and his next appearance in court is in February. It’s like they want to do something to him,” said the devastated mother.
The publication also made it clear that Irungu’s lead lawyer, Hassan Nandwa, stated that there were no applications for his transfer hence raising more questions on the alleged transfer.

Additionally, an account by the mother through the publication indicated that some warders of the prison were puzzled after they were questioned on the details of how a prisoner in remand would be transferred.
It is expected that a person who has been convicted and sentenced to get transfers from one prison to the other as the case of routine, however, in the case of a detainee whose case is still pending raises more alarm.
Irungu’s parents on Monday, December 9, made efforts to get to him by boarding a bus that was headed to Voi, with efforts by the local daily to speak to the Commissioner-General of Kenya Prisons proving futile.

“We have to see if he is okay and if indeed he is there,” said the mother.
Jowie has been held in solitary confinement following the pending case of the murder of Monica Kimani through orders directed by the High Court.
His bail application is set to be ruled over on February 13, 2020 hence expected to spend another Christmas in remand.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jail Warden Chief Insp. Ricky Heart Pegalan said SJ01 Virgilio Obispo was conducting a routine inspection at around 1 a.m. outside the premises of the city jail when he noticed a man trying to sneak in a red plastic bag inside the two-story facility which served as jail extension.
The unidentified man immediately ran away, leaving the red plastic bag hanging from the steel grills of the extension facility, prompting Obispo to grab the bag and bring it to the duty desk officer.
When jail duty officer Insp. Mark Jerome Cagurungan checked the contents of the bag, it yielded 11 rims of Mighty cigarettes, two packs of Marlboro red, two mobile phones, two head set and cellular phone charger wrapped in brown packaging tape.
Pegalan, a lawyer, said those who wanted to sneak contraband inside the jail facility will be facing jail time if they will be caught red handed.
He added that they will continue to adhere to the directives and policies issued by Regional Director of the Jail Bureau Jail Chief Supt. Ignacio Panti to fulfill its objective of zero contraband inside jail facility through intensified roving inspection and installation of preventive measures.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Around the world, ocean-impact accelerators are emerging as societies start to realise the importance of focusing efforts and investments towards healthier oceans.
Taking part in this exhilarating new movement, the OceanHub Africa launched their Ocean Innovation Africa event in Cape Town, supported by Wesgro, the South African French Embassy, the University of Cape Town and the V&A Waterfront.
Fifty carefully selected stakeholders from various backgrounds including entrepreneurs, researchers, investors, ocean business owners, non-profits and local authorities gathered to co-create the initiative’s roadmap in a bid to shape a future where both humans and oceans can thrive. 
OceanHub Africa is on a mission to inspire and support ocean-minded start-ups with the express aim of nurturing an environmentally conscious and profitable economy that effectively mitigates the effects of global warming as well as the overexploitation and pollution of the oceans.

Set to begin the programme early in the first quarter of 2020, OceanHub Africa will launch with the first cohort of six local start-ups. Leveraging its highly qualified network of stakeholders and facilitators it aims to deliver to the new initiatives the following services: 
OceanHub Africa is also offering a technology transfer support programme that promotes collaboration between researchers and entrepreneurs for science-based innovation.
By partnering with local universities, its objective is to find commercial use of scientific patents through the identification of transferable technologies and the incubation of selected projects.
This programme will strengthen the pipeline of ocean-minded start-ups and leverage the knowledge that lies within universities and research centres.
OceanHub Africa, currently hosted by South African venture fund and technology incubator, SAVANT Technologies, will inaugurate its Cape Town headquarters in February 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gasly: “I thought, okay I have these nine races where I’m going to show my skills"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pierre Gasly's 2019 was certainly a roller coaster as he faced promotion, demotion and a podium all in one season. The Frenchman has admitted he felt as if he had nine races to prove himself after returning to Toro Rosso.
Gasly started the season with Red Bull but the tone for his year was set at Albert Park as he missed out on the points on his debut. It gradually improved but during the summer break Red Bull took the decision to drop Gasly to Toro Rosso, and replace him with Alex Albon and that is how it will stay next season.
However, Gasly showed some signs of a resurgence at Toro Rosso, especially when he finished second in Brazil, ensuing jubilant scenes after the race. The Frenchman has admitted he was shocked and angry after receiving the news of his demotion.
“Of course when I got the news I was really shocked and kind of angry,” Gasly told Motorsportweek.com.
“I don’t feel it was fair, because these first six months were nowhere near what we should have shown. You do care, because you want to be in the fastest car.
“And I’ve tried to make changes in my way, and I’ve been promised things that in the end didn’t happen. There were many things that didn’t go in the right way.
“But at the end of the day this was the situation, it was done, it was passed, I couldn’t change it.
“I thought, okay, I have these nine races where I’m going to show my skills, my speed, my consistency, the things I’ve shown since I started single-seaters until I got to Red Bull."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like all the Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt fans will have to wait for a little longer as reports suggest that Brahmastra has been once again postponed to winter 2020
It looks like Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt’s upcoming fantasy drama – Brahmastra – is one highly jinxed project, and we aren’t just saying it. The film, which was initially slated to release in December this month, got pushed to summer 2020 citing some heavily pending VFX work. And now, if the recent report in Bollywood Hungama is anything to go by, Brahmastra has been postponed further to winter 2020, i.e., almost the end of next year.  A source close to the film’s development told the portal that this time, too, VFX is the cause behind the delay. (ALSO READ - Brahmastra: Lovebirds Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt Strike A Serious Pose In The Icy Hills Of Manali – PICS)
The source said, "A major chunk of VFX is still pending which includes the stuff shot with Shah Rukh Khan at a studio in Mumbai, and the plot that unfolds in Manali and Varanasi. The company working on the visual effects has conveyed to the producers that they won't be able to get the film ready by summer due to complexities in the visual effects, which have come across as a shock to everyone working on the film.” They added how Karan Johar and Ayan Mukerji aren’t keen on treating audiences with a half-baked product and hence giving their best to the film’s visual effects.
Further, the source stated how Karan and Ayan are confident that once Brahmastra’s trailer and the teaser are dropped online, fans will be blown away by its spectacular visuals. Once the team gets a thumbs up from the VFX department, they will be officially announcing Brahmastra’s new release date with a poster or a teaser. We wait!
Brahmastra also stars Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna and Mouni Roy in pivotal roles.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Doug Ford goes back to the well on water bottling ban</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ontario’s moratorium on new permits to bottle water will be extended for nine months.
Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks Jeff Yurek “proposed” the extension on November 19. Just weeks earlier, he had signalled through the media his government's intention to allow the moratorium imposed by the previous Liberal to expire at the end of the year. 
Now his government is accepting further public input until December 18 “to verify the extensive data and scientific evidence submitted already,” according to a government spokesperson.
Nestlé Waters Canada, which has been at the centre of ongoing controversy over efforts to renew its water bottling permits at wells in Hillsburgh and Aberfoyle in Wellington County west of Toronto, has expressed support for the extension. A company spokesperson told the CBC that the company welcomes the opportunity to "demonstrate [its] commitment to the responsible stewardship of Ontario's freshwater resources."
Yurek’s change of position is essential. But there’s still a long way to go to protect water as a common good in Ontario. In fact, the Ford government is in the midst of weakening environmental protections through Bill 132. The so-called Better for People, Smarter for Business Act, has passed second reading in the Legislature. 
So why the reversal on water bottling permits? The government could be just stalling for time.
Persistent public opposition to Nestlé’s water bottling operations in Wellington County has reached a boiling point with the threat of future water shortages in the region linked to Nestle’s expansion efforts in the region. Nestlé Waters Canada currently has permission to extract 4.7 million litres of water a day at wells in Hillsburgh and Aberfoyle. 
Also, preliminary results of a water study in Centre Wellington – site of Nestlé’s proposed Middlebrook well – indicates that the community is “at risk of not having enough water to service its growing population,” according to Martin Keller of the Grand River Conservation Authority.
Moreover, scientific studies show that pumping at this well will interfere with the township being able to expand its water system. 
At the same time, the Ford government has stated it’s keen to see more housing development in the community. So why would the government approve a new well for Nestlé? (It would add only one or two jobs.)
In the weeks before Yurek’s announcement, more than 500 people attended events in four different cities to draw public attention to Nestlé's operations. Tens of thousands of people have signed petitions sponsored by Environmental Defence and the Council of Canadians calling for a permanent moratorium on water takings in the province. 
The groups warn that weakening water protections could put the public at risk as happened at Walkerton under Mike Harris.
Harris was premier in Ontario in 2000 when an outbreak of waterborne gastroenteritis in the town just 100 kilometres northwest of Guelph, sickened more than 2,000 people and resulted in six deaths. The government ignored the warnings.
For the Ford government, the stakes are just as high as the growing climate crisis increases the pressure on drinking water supply, making the future of Nestlé and the rest of the bottled water industry less tenable. 
Mike Balkwill is campaign director with Wellington Water Watchers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">STAR Screen Awards 2019: After Mocking Urvashi Rautela's Style Statement, Taapsee Pannu Finds Herself Seated Next To The Actress- EXCLUSIVE</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpotboyE.com has been bringing to you all the goss from inside the STAR Screen Awards 2019, which unfolded last night. Here's another one about Urvashi Rautela and Taapsee Pannu
Actresses and their cat fights form an integral part of Bollywood. While not even one openly accept that they have issues and usually give the "we're friends" tag, yet updates about things going sour between them don't stop coming. 
You may recall, a few days back, reports said that Taapsee Pannu feels Urvashi Rautela needs a new stylist. The comment made a lot of headlines and Urvashi's fans also got upset with Taapsee's statement, mocking the Paagalpani actress' fashion mantra. 
However, last night, something absolutely interesting happened at the STAR Screen Awards 2019. Who would have thought that the ladies will end up sitting next to each other at the function? We bring to you an EXCLUSIVE picture of the same.
That's right. When Urvashi walked in at the awards show, she was told that her seat is next to Taapsee's. Now, she did not make a fuss about it and quietly accepted to sit besides Taapsee, in spite of latter's comment on her styling. We don't know what the Pink actress was feeling about it though. 
Now, after seeing what Urvashi was wearing yesterday at the awards nite, we really hope Taapsee gave the same suggestion to her face to face.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Feds charge Volkswagen with violating environment law for faking emissions tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA — German auto giant Volkswagen appears ready to strike a plea deal with Canada after being charged Monday for allegedly importing cars into this country that company executives knew violated emissions standards.
Environment and Climate Change Canada announced the company had been charged with 60 violations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. All but two of the charges related to the 128,000 vehicles imported into Canada between 2008 and 2015 that had illegal emissions.
The other two charges are for providing false information.
Canada's case against Volkswagen comes more than four years after the company admitted to installing software on 11 million cars worldwide to trick emissions-testing equipment into concluding the cars ran more cleanly than they actually did.
The company issued a statement saying it has co-operated fully with Canadian investigators and that a deal is prepared ahead of the company's first court appearance in Toronto on Friday.
"At the hearing, the parties will submit for the court's consideration a proposed plea resolution and seek its approval," the statement said. "The details of the proposed plea resolution will be presented at the hearing."
Environment Canada officials published notice of the charges Monday, but said they won't comment further because the matter is before the courts.
Environment Canada's investigation, launched in September 2015, was repeatedly criticized by environmental experts and lawyers for taking too long.
The company pleaded guilty in U.S. court in 2017 for violating American laws and was fined $4.3 billion. In 2018, German prosecutors fined the company one-billion euros for the emissions cheating case, which some dubbed "dieselgate" because it involved Volkswagen's diesel engines.
Several Volkswagen executives and managers involved in the deception were charged in the U.S. and Germany, and some have already been sent to prison.
In total, the elaborate scheme has cost the company more than US$30 billion in legal fines and civic lawsuits as well as compensation to customers who returned the affected cars for refunds or exchanges.
The culprit software, known as a defeat device, is illegal under Canadian law.
Most cars are tested for emissions in labs and the software allowed vehicles to produce lower emissions while in testing mode than when driven normally. The emissions were allegedly 35 times above Canadian legal limits.
Muhannad Malas, toxics program manager at Canadian advocacy group Environmental Defence, said it is frustrating how long the charges took, but is pleased to see them nonetheless.
Canadian law allows for fines of up to $1 million for each day an offence continues, but Malas hopes whatever agreement is reached has the right effect.
"The levy or the fines collected have to respond to the massive scale of this environmental crime," he said.
The affected cars in Canada included 3.0-litre and 2.0-litre diesel engine vehicles sold under Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brands
A 2016 Health Canada study estimated 320 Canadians died prematurely in 2015 because of illnesses related to inhaling diesel exhaust from on-road vehicles. The number of premature deaths more than doubled to 710 when combining on-road and off-road sources of diesel emissions, such as diesel burned for electricity.
Nitrous oxide, ozone and small particulate matter are the main causes of cancers, and respiratory illnesses bronchitis and asthma.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Muslim Waqf Chips Away at Temple Mount Increasing Pressure on Retaining Walls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Islamic Waqf announced on Sunday that renovation work has been resumed at the Al Marwani mosque, otherwise known as Solomon’s Stables, in the Temple Mount. The Waqf has assumed custodianship over the holy site and often into making illegal unilateral decisions the mount.Renovation work on the 600 square yard complex lies in stark contrast to the status quo on the Temple Mount.
This development comes shortly after the opening of the Gate of Mercy. Many are concerned that the renovation is happening without the supervision of the Israeli Antiquities Authority.
Solomon’s Stables are an underground vaulted space that is now used by local Muslims for prayer. The area is at the bottom of a set of stairs that leads down from the al-Aqsa Mosque, underneath the Temple Mount, to the base of the southern wall of the Mount. Solomon’s Stables are situated 12.5 m (41 ft) underneath the courtyard on the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount. The enclave features twelve rows of pillars and arches. Back in 1996, the Waqf converted the space into a prayer area. They did this by installing lights and floor tiles which compromised the integrity of the structure’s walls.
The structure is believed to have been constructed by King Herod as an extension of the platform of the Temple Mount southward onto the Ophel. Herod’s engineers built the massive platform above the slopes of the Temple Mount. They did this by erecting a substructure that consisted of a series of vaulted arches to reduce pressure on the retaining walls. The vaults are supported by 88 pillars resting on enormous Herodian blocks and divided into 12 rows of galleries”, were originally storage spaces for the Second Temple. Tourists are rarely ever allowed to enter the spaces with Herodian finishes.
By and large, the underground space remained empty with the exception of the Crusader rule over Jerusalem. The Crusaders transitioned it into a stable for their cavalry. The rings for tethering horses can still remain on several of the pillars -hence the term ‘Solomon’s Stables’.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vodacom, SAPS power crime prevention via app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vodacom’s partnership with the South African Police Service (SAPS) to launch the MySAPS mobile app is part of the company’s transition to being a purpose-driven organisation.
This is according to Rudi Matjokana, managing executive for public enterprise at Vodacom Business, saying in addition to supporting national crime prevention efforts, the company seeks to ensure digital inclusion for all.
After a soft launch in August this year, Vodacom and SAPS unveiled the MySAPS app in October, with the aim to bring police services to the palm of the citizens’ hands.
The free app, developed and enabled by Vodacom, is available for devices running Android and iOS operating systems. For those that have feature phones, it can be accessed via USSD.
Matjokana told ITWeb Vodacom wants to enable and empower private and public organisations as well as help digitise government services to serve a broader society.
“Our purpose-driven mission is to connect people and things to the Internet. We also want to ensure inclusion for all and improve people’s lives.”
MySAPS app enables citizens to search for the nearest police station, submit a tip off, call the crime stop number, visit the SAPS Web site, as well as send messages, according to Matjokana,
He says the app is “for everyone’s safety”.“This is how we are changing criminal reporting. A person can report criminal acts as and when they see them and the police will act on it. You can report anonymously and the police will still act on whatever you say you need them to do.”
While he didn’t provide specifics in terms of how many times the app has been downloaded, Matjokana noted the reception has been quite good. “It’s just that we don’t have enough man power to be going around helping more people download the app.
“Every citizen should join us on this journey; we should not leave anybody behind. We should make sure that everybody can have access to these services [and] the Internet.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kartik Aaryan is soaring high as his latest release Pati Patni Aur Woh is successfully entertaining the audience in theatres. The film is based on the lines of cheating and from what Kartik Aaryan has revealed in his latest interview, we think he doesn’t mind cheating on a person in real life as well.
Well, Kartik Aaryan made some shocking statements when asked about relationships that may leave you speechless as well. According to the Pati Patni Aur Woh star, it isn’t cheating if one finds some other girl cute while being in a relationship. He revealed that he has been attracted to someone else while he was dating a girl and he does not consider it to be cheating on her.
While interacting with Times Now, he said, “I have been in a relationship and I have got attracted to someone else? Yes, I have! Emotional cheating should never be the case. Physical cheating too shouldn’t be the case. But emotional is worse. So in attraction, it isn’t cheating because you feel she’s cute then it’s okay. It’s better if it doesn’t go beyond that.”
Well, this is not the first time we have seen Kartik make such shocking revelations about his personal life. Earlier he had said, “Acting and sex are like bread and butter. You can’t quit either. Acting and sex or love go hand in hand for me. I don’t like talking about my personal life but I don’t like hiding it also.”
On the work front, Kartik Aaryan will be next seen in Bhool Bhulaiyya 2. The film also stars Kiara Advani and Tabu in pivotal roles. Kartik has also been roped in for Dostana 2. The film stars Janhvi Kapoor and Lakshya.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pound Sterling hits Fresh 31-Month High vs. Euro on Survation Poll</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Poll shows 14 point lead for Conservatives
- Odds for Con. majority surge to 80%
- Sterling rally extends
- Late Labour surge looking increasingly unlikely
The British Pound hit a fresh 31-month high against the Euro Monday after two polls showed gains for the Conservative Party and losses for Labour, confirming expectations that the party of Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains on track to secure a majority.
A BMG poll for the Independent showed the Conservatives up two points to 41% and Labour down 1 point to 32%.
A poll out from Survation for ITV's Good Morning Britain show had the Conservatives up 2 points to 45% and Labour down 2 points to 31%.
"As is normal as an election date draws closer, the level of respondents we interviewed who said they were undecided this week’s poll was 12%, down from 17% last week - and so some of the movement we are seeing in this week’s polling may be driven by the public, having seen the various TV debates and manifesto launches simply making their minds up," says Survation, in a briefing on their latest poll findings.
On the Conservative Party's ongoing strength, Survation says, "the Conservative party has increased support to some extent in this polling amongst both Leave and Remain voters."
Any lead of over 7 points suggests an outright majority, while a lead of 14 points would signify something close to a landslide. "GBP is rallying again after markets all but fully discount a good Tory majority, ignoring the high number of undecided voters – Friday will show whether that was a good strategy or not," says Elsa Lignos, Global Head of FX Strategy with RBC Capital Markets.
The polls suggest a Sterling-friendly trend remains in place with just four days to go until what is being billed as the most important election of a generation: the Pound-to-Euro exchange rate rose to its highest level since May 2017 when it reached 1.1893 on Monday. The Pound-to-Dollar exchange rate on the other hand is quoted at 1.3160, just below last week's 7-month highs at 1.3162.
"Judging from recent polls, the most likely scenario is the Conservative party win majority government. If this scenario pans out, GBP/USD can edge higher towards 1.3500 over the next few weeks as the UK would be on the way towards an orderly Brexit on 31 January 2020," says Kim Mundy, a foreign exchange strategist with CBA.

Survation's equivalent poll in the 2017 election, released four days before polling day, showed the Conservative lead down to just one point, making Survation the most accurate pollster in the 2017 election.
This is Survation's final poll for Good Morning Britain but it will be releasing further polls for other clients it has been confirmed.
Perhaps the most significant aspect of polling over recent days is a confirmation that Labour's recent attack on the Conservative's lead has stalled, ensuring the gap between the two parties is wide enough to allow the Conservatives a majority. In 2017 the rise in Labour's vote share proved relentless, such that by the time of the vote they were able to close the gap to just two points. Foreign exchange markets have been on alert for a repeat of this performance in 2019, but with just four days to go until the vote and only three days in which to campaign, the closing of this gap by Labour looks to be a remote prospect.
A host of polls released at the weekend pout the Conservative lead at between 9 and 10 points.
The implied odds of a Conservative majority with the bookmakers has surged to a fresh campaign high of 80% on Monday, according to the Betfair Exchange. Last Friday saw odds sitting at 72.5%, while the start of the previous week saw odds closer to 65%.
"Bookies odds show a Tory majority as a near certainty, in line with the steady gap in most (but not all) opinion polls. But there is a historically high number of undecided voters which could affect as many as 80 marginal seats. We will be neutral GBP going into Thursday and look to trade the outcome," says Lignos.
The steady rise in the odds for a Conservative majority has coincided with a broad-based rally in the value of Sterling as markets continue to see a majority win for the Conservatives as being the most market-friendly outcome. "Polls continue to show the Conservatives on course for a majority government after Thursday's UK election, which would end the Brexit uncertainty and prove the most favourable outcome for GBP," says Richard Pace, an options analyst with Thomson Reuters.

Various news sources are reporting Monday that Johnson will close his campaign in north England, where he will tour marginal seats in Labour’s 'heartlands' where he believes his message of delivering Brexit will strike a chord with jaded Labour voters. 
Johnson will warn voters that they face a “great betrayal” under Jeremy Corbyn as he says that Labour MPs won their seats on a "false prospectus" of securing Brexit but subsequently "stuck two fingers up to the public".
The Telegraph reports Johnson will visit every region of England and Wales to tell voters "that their instruction to leave the EU will be reversed by Islington-based Labour politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes”.
Labour will meanwhile attempt to steer the conversation away from Brexit and back on to the economy by announcing they would begin renationalising rail, mail and utilities within the first 100 days of a Corbyn administration.
Looking ahead, YouGov will release their final MRP projection on Tuesday. This is where YouGov take their most recent polling datasets and translate them into seat numbers. 
"The MRP poll from YouGov seemed to more accurately predict the result of the 2017 election than any of its competitors, which is why the results of such a survey a few weeks ago caused a stir when it predicted a Conservative majority. However, that was relatively early in the campaign, so tomorrow night’s update from YouGov will be watched closely to see whether it shows any change in voting intentions as the day approaches," says Rhys Herbert, an economist with Lloyds Bank.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The President of Ireland's award ceremony took place in Dublin Castle.
The awards were presented by President Michael D Higgins in a prestigious ceremony hosted by Sinead Burke.
Serena O’Dwyer received her bronze and silver award as a pupil of Cashel Community School and started her Gaisce journey to the gold award in sixth year under the guidance of her President Award Leader Irene Codd.
The Gold Award requires participants to undertake five challenges.
Serena volunteered in Uganda for the residential element.
For her adventure journey she undertook a four-day walk along the Wild Atlantic Way, she volunteered as a mentor in a Big Brother Big Sister program where she assisted a young lady from a disadvantaged background.
To keep fit for her physical section Serena chose dancing and finally for her personal skill she took singing lessons.
Cashel Community School would like to congratulate Serena on this fantastic achievement. Her tenacity to complete all the requirements of the award is to be commended.
The Gaisce Gold Award challenge is not an easy one – it demands motivation, determination and focus over a minimum of 52 weeks but in most cases takes a number of years to complete.
This achievement not only demonstrates a personal determination, but also a commitment to the service of her community.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cover image via HUAWEI & TechGoondu
By heading to the HUAWEI Online Official Store, you'll be able to redeem your RM200 voucher and use it on 12 December 2019. Yas, discounts are the best. :)
That's right, we Malaysians were the first in the world to get a glimpse of the HUAWEI Nova 5T ahead of it's global launch. Positioned as a lifestyle smartphone, the HUAWEI Nova 5T is for those who value top-notch performance, insane camera features, and aesthetically-pleasing design.
Coming with five different cameras - four on the rear and one on the front, the HUAWEI Nova 5T aims to capture that picture-perfect moment every single time. The rear Quad-AI camera setup consists of a 48MP main camera, a 16MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth-sensing camera. The depth-sensing lens helps with that buttery-smooth bokeh for portrait modes, which is always a plus!The 32MP front selfie camera is actually hidden under the 6.26-inch 'All-View Display'. This provides a flawless, unobtrusive content viewing experience, without any unnecessary distractions. 
Another neat feature of the Quad-AI camera setup is the ability to shoot stunning lowlight photography via the AIS Super Night Mode, which drastically reduces noise while still retaining as much light as possible. This is an especially useful feature for those who love the contrast of brightly-lit subjects in darker settings.Say goodbye to grainy night-time shots! ﻿
At the heart of the Nova 5T is the world's first 7nm mobile AI chipset, which lets you enjoy a super fluid, super smooth user experience, without any nasty lag. The dual-NPU setup enables the Nova 5T to take on even the most demanding tasks, like hardcore gaming and even a long day of multi-tasking! The power of the Kirin 980 chipset is also complemented by 8GB RAM and 128GB ROM, featuring ultra-fast storage (UFS) technology.Optimum performance at an efficient level of power consumption. What more could you ask for? :D
It's tiring when you have to wait for your phone to charge up before you can finally use it for your daily content viewing pleasure. The HUAWEI Nova 5T gets rid of that burden by packing a fairly decent 3,750 mAh battery, coupled with 22.5W SuperCharge technology. Just how fast is this charging technology exactly?It's pretty zippy. It takes just 30 minutes to get from a dead battery to 50%. That means you get to spend less time waiting for your phone to charge, and more time actually using it to its full potential!
The HUAWEI Nova 5T comes in three different colours - Black, Blue Crush, and Midsummer Purple. The exclusive Midsummer Purple variant also gets a special Nova monogram on the back, just to add to the stylish look of the device. The 6.26-inch 'All-View Display' provides a 91.7% screen-to-body ration, which means you'll really be able to see ALL of your content in such a pleasing screen size. The front-facing camera itself is placed on the top-left corner of the screen, hidden from direct line of sight. That means you're able to focus on your content, and just your content alone!The phone also uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, making it super ergonomic for daily use, since our natural grip usually rests our thumb (for right handers) and index finger (for lefties) where the sensor is positioned. No fumbling about here. :)
You can get this amazing discount, plus other cool freebies when you redeem the online voucher on 12 December 2019! Freebies include the HUAWEI AP38 SuperCharge car charger, a Nova gift box, and a tripod - all amounting to RM285. :D

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American rapper, Cardi B’s arrival in the nation’s capital has really left most celebrities and Ghanaians alike in pains as some of them were snubbed in a supposed ‘meet and greet’ with her at the Kempinski hotel.
Self-acclaimed Ghanaian celebrities like Afia Schwarzenegger, Akuapem poloo, Hajia4real, and others who could not meet the international star after over five hours took to social media to express their displeasure but Cardi B in a response via Instagram live poured out her frustration after she was wrongly accused of being arrogant by the so-called slay queens disguised under the mask of celebrities.
During the ongoing brouhaha, Ghanaians trooped micro-blogging platform, Twitter to express their disappointment in the slayqueens for disgracing Ghana in such a manner.
Check out some social media reactions below:
The 27-year-old international star is widely known for her music hits like, ‘Bodak Yellow’, which topped Billboard Hot 100 charts.
Her numerous wins include a Grammy Award, seven Billboard Music Awards, eleven BET Hip Hop Awards, four American Music Awards, and four MTV Music Video Awards.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Exes Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh are a part of Bigg Boss 13 and it is given that there will be clashes between the two. Today, we shall see them dragging their past and throwing some nasty accusations at each other
Chandrakanta stars Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh were once deeply in love with each other. However, they had a very nasty breakup and soon they turned enemies. They appeared on a dance reality show together as exes, and they couldn't stop screaming at each other. Now, the same has followed to Bigg Boss 13 house. Madhurima who entered as a wild card contestant last week will have a massive showdown with her ex Vishal Aditya Singh today. So much that they'll start screaming at each other and even start abusing.
In the promo shared, we see Madhurima confronting Vishal over how he treats women. She said that he did not treat his girlfriend right and that he has no right to advice others on how they should deal with women. Vishal then goes on to talk about how abusive Madhurima was while in a relationship and that she even slapped him in front of everyone. Vishal says she shouldn't have come to Bigg Boss as her entry has made him uncomfortable and that's when Madhuri says 'Tumhare Baap Ka Show Hai?' The lady calls Vishal 'fake' while he calls her 'worthless'. Watch the video below:
Well, this has left us pretty confused as just a few hours ago we saw Vikas Gupta trying to mend things between Vishal and Madhurima. In fact, in a video, we also saw the lady walking up to Vishal in the night with a motive to talk. We were hoping that things will get sorted between the two, but, now it seems highly unlikely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China Announces A 3-Year Plan To Remove All Foreign Computer Equipments, Software And Replace With Home-Grown Products</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Under a plan dubbed as “3-5-2”, China has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be removed from government offices and public institutions within three years, the Financial Times reported.
China will begin a large scale replacement program under which 30 per cent of foreign personal computer (PC) equipment and software will be removed in 2020, 50 per cent in 2021, and 20 per cent the year after.
The directive by Chinese government is viewed as a setback to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and Microsoft . The plan is seen as a retaliatory step against Washington’s moves to limit the use of Chinese technology, as the trade war between the countries turns into a technology war.
According to the FT report, the directive would result in an estimated 20 to 30 million pieces of hardware needing to be replaced and that this work would begin in 2020.
It remains to be seen how the hardwareand software replacement will be achieved in a three-year timeframe. Chinese government offices promotes the use of desktop computers from the Chinese-owned company Lenovo, but various components of the computers, including its processor chips and hard drives are made by American companies.
On May 16, the US Commerce Department to place Huawei on its entity list which blocks companies from supplying US-sourced technology to Huawei without a license.
Trump Administration has also initiated measures to bar US carriers from using Huawei equipment for next-generation 5G networks on the grounds of national security. Huawei had made massive investment in 5G wireless technology, hoping to lead the world in the race to adopt the new technology.
The United States has charged that Huawei and its widely used technologies is potentially accessed by the Chinese state for its espionage. The company has pushed back on the claim, insisting that it is an independent company with no government ties.
Huawei is the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment and the number two vendor of smartphones, ahead of Apple Inc. and behind Samsung Electronics Co.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nedbank notches up 1.7m digitally active customers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nedbank has experienced accelerated adoption across its digital banking platforms, with a 30% growth rate from 2018.
After undertaking its digital transformation journey to address clients’ requirements, the big four bank says it now has 1.7 million digitally active customers, with its digital channels witnessing faster growth rates than walk-in branch services.
Mutsa Chironga, managing executive of consumer banking at Nedbank, told ITWeb the bank is constantly focused on improving its products and services across all channels, with additional services on the cards in the new year.
“Our digital transformation initiatives are premised on several pillars: cost efficiency, convenience, affordability and security, all focused on enhancing the customer service journey for our clients.
“We are seeing an increase in adoption of our digital banking platforms, with the Nedbank Money App currently having a user base of 871 000, while the mobile wallet-based account, MobiMoney, has signed up around 250 000 users.”
The number of payment transactions conducted on Nedbank’s digital platforms recently surpassed R37 billion, he adds.
The Nedbank Money App, launched in November 2017, was rated the number one app by users on Android and iOS, among the five major retail banks in SA. This, according to Chironga, is an indication that its users are experiencing higher satisfaction levels than users of other banking apps.
Last month, the Old Mutual-owned bank introduced Money App Lite, a more streamlined and lighter version of the Nedbank Money App, which is less data-intensive and uses less space on mobile devices.
Absa says it has 1.6 million digitally active users across all its digital platforms, with the Absa Banking App seeing a 26.7% year-on-year growth.
First National Bank (FNB) told ITWeb its banking app had over 2.8 million active users, last December, indicating a 12% increase on the 2.5 million active app users the bank had at the end of June 2018.
Overall, FNB has 8.2 million customers in SA, with around a third of those clients using the app. Financial transactions on the FNB app are growing by 52% year on year.
With a presence in seven Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa countries, Nedbank has continued its ongoing expansion through subsidiaries and banks in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, as well as representative offices in Angola and Kenya.
The bank is also harnessing the power of technology to enhance its sales strategy, notes Chironga.
“A big part of our digital strategy is to enable quick and easy digital sales, through the products and services offered via the app and the mobile wallet, including purchasing airtime, opening bank accounts, making loan applications and sending money to over 33 African countries through our partnership with Eco bank. We’ve recently added funeral insurance as a product offering and we are constantly adding different products and services.”
Through its partnership with software company, Hey Jude, Nedbank offers an array of services on its app aimed at supporting customers beyond banking services, including finance assist, medical-on-demand services and a digital personal assistant.
It was the first local bank to launch a scan-to-pay solution within its app, allowing customers to scan a Masterpass, Snapscan or Zapper QR code to make retail purchases and use utility services without their banking card.
In June, Nedbank announced a point of sale finance application partnership with Switch Pay that enables merchants to facilitate finance applications in-store, on behalf of their customers.
While the bank is continuously running educational campaigns to increase the number of users on its banking platforms, Chironga points out general challenges that often deter banking customers from using digital platforms are a complex on-boarding process, lack of education and high data costs.
“While there are different customer segments, with some being more digitally inclined than others, it’s clear that Nedbank is in the middle of a huge digital migration. Even though there may be many customers who are not utilising the digital channels today, that situation is changing very quickly, influenced by driving education and awareness initiatives.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hamilton: "I grew up like everyone else thinking dairy and meat was good for you"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lewis Hamilton has given an insight into what it is like being a vegan and admitted when he used to eat meat he would wake up feeling groggy.
Hamilton won his sixth Formula 1 Drivers' Championship in 2019, scoring his highest number of points and winning eleven races as he took another step closer to Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles. It was his third Drivers' Championship in a row and his fifth with Mercedes.
The Brit's vegan diet has been well publicised and it has been met with mixed reviews. However, Hamilton has explained how he got into it and how other people can try it out.
“I grew up like everyone else thinking dairy and meat was good for you. I thought I was living healthily and was doing right," Hamilton told Options.
“Then I met a few new people who were vegans, and they started showing me some of the things happening in our world that I was completely oblivious to. It freaked me out. I started to read about it and realised that what I was taught to believe was healthy, was not.
“So, I decided to try and gradually move in that direction, slowly getting rid of red meat, then chicken, then fish until I was ready to fully commit. I wanted to feel for myself how big of a difference it would make.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Myles Stephenson Reveals What He Said To Jacqueline In The Jungle & Admits He's 'Not Scared' Of Dan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm A Celeb's Myles Stephenson opens up about what was said between himself and Jacqueline Jossa in the jungle.
It's after reports emerged that he told her that he believes her husband Dan Osborne had an affair with his ex Gabby Allen.
The Sun reports that soon after, Dan allegedly told his friends that he wants to, 'knock [Myles'] head off.'
Myles' response to this is, 'I’ve grown up with much scarier people than Dan.'
The Rak-Su member opens up to The Sun following his I'm A Celeb eviction.
When told about Dan's alleged threats, Myles says, 'It’s an immature response.'
'If you know you’ve done no wrong, why would you want to knock someone’s head off?'
Myles continues, 'He shouldn’t get his back up. It makes him look bitter and stupid.'
'If he wants to come and try and knock my head off it won’t end well.'
'One of us is going to end up in the nick and nobody needs that.'
When this interview took place last week, Myles was staying in the same hotel as Dan in Australia.
At this point, they hadn't come face to face.
He tells the outlet, 'He’s got two kids here. He should be looking after them.'
The singer believes Dan should knock on his door and talk to him.
'He’s here. He knew I was coming out of the jungle and he could’ve knocked on my door.'
'I’d have let him in. I’ve grown up with much scarier people than Dan.'
'I’m not scared of a thing.'
He goes on, 'You can make threats, it means nothing. This isn’t a game. I’m sitting here with my family now.'
'If you’re walking around all heated, in the foyer, we’re going to cross paths.'
Myles reveals what he said to Jacqueline in the jungle.
'There was a moment in camp when Jac asked about the situation.'
'I said to her, ‘Look, we’re not going to talk about it now. We’re in front of about 150 cameras right now’.'
He explains that she quizzed him even further when they were on their way to a Bushtucker Trial.
'I spoke to her about it. I told her what I thought about the situation.'
And he admits, 'I told her what I’ve seen.'
He goes on, 'I told her, 'I’m only telling you because you’re already a sister to me.' If it was the other way, I’d want to know.'
'I also went on to tell her that, at the end of the day, I’m not a spiteful person.'
It sounds like the Rak-Su member has decided to take a step back.
'I spoke to Jac about it and said, ‘Whatever you decide to take from what I’ve told is down to you and Dan.''
'I’ve got nothing against him. I said to her that if he tried something with me, it could go sour.'
'I’m not going to stand there and take punches, I’m going to fight back, but if he wants to talk, we can talk.'
Thankfully, it looks like Myles and Dan have gotten past their differences.
A source tells MailOnline that they met and have, 'cleared the air of any misunderstandings that have been reported.'
In pictures obtained by the outlet, the pair were pictured laughing poolside in Australia.
These allegations are the least of Dan's worries.
He's fighting off claims he had a threesome with Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling last year.

This weekend Salman revealed some secrets about Arhaan Khan to Rashami Desai and the whole nation went crazy and started the hashtag #StayStrongRashami. This week eviction was Himanshi Khurana.
Asim Riaz has been very vocal about his feelings for Himanshi Khurana. But Himanshi revealed that she’s already in a relationship with someone but can’t reveal him on national television. In an interview with Pinkvilla Himanshi spoke about her equation with Asim and told that they are just good friends and nothing more.
Talking about where she stands with Asim, Himanshi said, “In majority, I feel happy that people loved us inside. At least, they understand that I was clear in my point and he was clear in his. He and I are very good friends. It takes guts to say what he said on the show knowing that I can’t cross my limits. There are so many friends who might end up liking you but not necessary that they have the wrong motive behind it.”
Bigg Boss 13 is extended by five weeks because of the enormous response show has been getting. We can’t wait to see who takes the Bigg Boss 13 trophy home this time.
Tell us in the comments section below, who do you think will win the show.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blockchain, A Four-Time Waltz: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra & the CBDCs – The Need for a New Balance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We have deliberately chosen to limit our presentation, for pedagogical reasons, to the four fundamental periods represented by the emergence of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra and CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) because no other event (derived or similar project) has had such an impact on the global economy. Here, we present to the readers a possible configuration of the blockchain sector based on a four-part analysis, followed by a concluding proposal.
The Bitcoin blockchain was originally designed for a single purpose: to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer system for exchanging monetary value, freeing itself from third parties that are the financial institutions.
Admittedly, legally, Bitcoin in most countries is not considered as currency. The European Central Bank (ECB) thus consistently reminds us that the Euro is the only legal currency.
On an economic level, the debate continues to rage over the real status of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The discussion has become classic. Money fulfills three functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value (savings).   
We can argue indefinitely about whether these three criteria are present in the case of Bitcoin (and other global cryptocurrencies). It is true that more and more merchants accept Bitcoin (medium of exchange and unit of account), but it is also true that the “store of value” function has become predominant. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are subject to speculative movements (notably through trading platforms), bringing them closer to the nature of (risky) investments.
The Ethereum public blockchain was designed to provide a platform for decentralized applications. The purpose, therefore, being not mainly monetary but functional or “utilitarian”. The ether functions as an access token, allowing decentralized applications (called “smart contracts”) to be deployed and executed. This is how the notion of utility token was born.
In practice, the Ether has followed the fate of Bitcoin: an investment tool, and to a lesser extent a means of payment. The phenomenon of ICOs (initial coin offerings – fundraising by issuing tokens) has only accentuated this trend. Indeed, Ethereum’s only “killer app” to date has been the standardization of the ERC-20 token allowing the issuance and exchange of tokens as part of the ICO. These tokens have fed a secondary market, operating as (volatile) financial instruments.
Ethereum found itself trapped in a paradox: the ether, a token designed as a utility, is used to create effects equivalent to Bitcoin. 
This situation is explained by a cost model that is not adapted to the reality of the current economy: each transaction carried out on the network is measured in “gas” and remunerated in Ether, the price of which fluctuates, to the benefit of one or more nodes (machines participating in the network) acting in concert. It is as if users had to pay (and in a volatile currency) for certain terminals of a telephone network for a given call.
This intrinsic constraint de facto limits the economic viability of most decentralized applications.    
In addition, there is the well-known problem of network scalability.
As a consequence of this situation, economic actors have preferred to develop so-called private blockchains, which do not require “fee-for-service” payment, the cost of which is borne by all participants and which ensure real scalability. It must be noted that to date, the only real cases of industrial use are deployed on this type of blockchain.
Libra is precisely a perfect example of a private, or permission-based, blockchain that was designed to “provide the scale, stability and security necessary to support billions of people and transactions around the world”.
What makes it really unique compared to other private blockchains are the following two characteristics:
This equation is unprecedented; the application infrastructure dimension is a positive signal for the blockchain sector (and more generally for the players in the digital economy). As much, the monetary ambition displayed by Libra poses a major problem for States (and Central Banks), which fear being deprived of their monetary sovereignty. 
Of course, there are other stable cryptocurrencies, or “stablecoins”, all issued via a public blockchain (unlike Libra); none, however, has raised any real concerns, their effect being limited.
Libra is the first stablecoin with a global dimension and none of the existing legal instruments have provided a framework for such a scenario. Indeed, it is relatively easy to regulate current issuers of stablecoins, for example by subjecting them to the status of electronic money institutions (like Paypal).
FINMA (the Swiss financial regulator) has already stated that Libra should at least become a payment institution. But in reality, Libra, by its size, is intended to be more like a World Central Bank, and there is no regulation there. The case is completely new.
If we push the reasoning to the end, the worst nightmare for the United States would be to see the value of their national currencies defined by the Libra, because its adoption would far exceed that of the currencies represented in its reserve (notably the US Dollar and the Euro). 
The role of the Central Banks would be reduced until they become subservient to the Libra reserve!
Some Central Banks quickly reacted. Large countries, such as China, have announced the launch of a cryptocurrency issued by their Central Bank, while micro-States are already experimenting with a virtual currency, often correlated to the dollar.
From the point of view of States, the advantages of these cryptocurrencies are obvious: reduction of the costs of issuing currency, traceability of transactions and real-time control of the economy.
From the users’ point of view, CBDCs allow the emergence of a payment method that is both legal and interoperable with the “industry 4.0“. Fiduciary (FIAT) money is not “compatible” with decentralized applications (particularly financial) and new services such as AI and IoT, which will increasingly be operated via blockchains (examples: future shared autonomous cars or remote control of a 3D printer). 
Of course, the associated risks are equally obvious, particularly in terms of privacy (the Big Brother spectrum), and the guarantees provided to citizens will depend on the political systems concerned. 
With the emergence of CBDCs (desirable for the industry 4.0), it is necessary to question the relevance of a monetary purpose for existing blockchains. In any case, the debate must be held.
For the sake of clarity, it is useful to refer to the classification proposed by FINMA for tokens.
FINMA distinguishes between:
In the absence of CBDC, confusion has occurred mechanically. Payment tokens (such as Bitcoin) behave like investment tokens, and utility tokens like payment tokens and/or investment tokens (ICOs). 
Some regulators have, involuntarily, contributed to this confusion by qualifying tokens as utility tokens, which are in fact investment tokens, at least from an economic point of view.
This is the case when the token, at the time of its issuance, cannot be used for anything other than an investment function (to be resold and traded on a trading platform). FINMA and the SEC quickly considered such tokens as investment products.
France, in adopting the “Pacte Law” (Loi Pacte), did not go that far, considering itself bound by a formal definition of financial securities imposed by European law (and confirmed by ESMA, the European financial regulator, it should be noted).
However, France had a national regime (intermediaries in “miscellaneous goods”) flexible enough to deal with tokens with no utility other than a financial one, according to a conception similar to that of the Swiss and American regulators. Finally, it opted for a compromise (commendable given the prevailing confusion) of an ad hoc regime (Pacte Law), where “service providers on digital assets” (PSANs) are regulated in the same way whether they are payment tokens or utility tokens.   
How then to define a healthy distribution of the roles of each typology of blockchain (monetary, utility and investment)?
Simply put, the monetary function in the strict sense should naturally be exercised by Central Banks, which are the only bodies in a position to apply a monetary policy in the general interest (setting the key rate, controlling inflation, etc.).
These State cryptocurrencies will be the preferred means of payment to access decentralized applications and/or tokenized financial products (investment tokens).
As an illustration, Facebook could give up the monetary dimension of Libra and assign it a utilitarian function in the fight against fake news and fake profiles. Thus, users of its social networks would buy Libra tokens in CBDC to authenticate shared content and identify its authors.
As for Bitcoin, it will never be able to compete with CBDCs, especially when they become interoperable. This does not mean that Bitcoin cannot be used as a means of exchange if the parties concerned agree, but its primary function will ultimately remain that of a store of value, a savings product, calling for a minimum level of investor protection.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The rise and rise of the first African-American woman distiller and operator of a nationally distributed vodka</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For almost six years since she released Black Momma Vodka, Vanessa Braxton has been a major force in the spirit industry in the United States.
In 2013 when she introduced her ultra-premium vodka brand, she made history as the first African-American woman owner and operator of a nationally distributed vodka.
She is also the founder of the country’s first black-owned tea and beverage plant. At the moment, her vodka brand is a favorite of many vodka lovers in the country.
Having started making teas in 2016, the 50-year-old has so far made business transactions with over 33,000 online and wholesale customers and has made almost $3 million in sales.
Last month, she made headlines again when she announced that she would be taking over three storefronts in a New York shopping plaza to open Black Momma Tea & Café.
When opened in 2020, the restaurant will serve about 160 different blends of tea, three flavored agaves as well as other organic and vegan food products.
And the Black Momma Vodka CEO is all geared up for her new venture.
With a huge experience in the government and corporate industry, Braxton, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, earned a bachelor of science degree in construction management and engineering from Pratt Institute in New York.
She then went through the executive program in negotiation at Harvard Law School and consortium with MIT.
Braxton subsequently started a career in corporate and government industries where she managed construction and engineering contracts worth over $350 million for the New York State government, reports Black Enterprise.
But while in college, Braxton was already selling drinks to her colleagues after having obtained a liquor license. This will push her to start Black Momma Vodka after retiring from her corporate and government work.
Black Momma Vodka is “distilled five times and filtered five times from corn for its signature smooth taste. It’s distilled through Crushed Diamond Lava Rocks and fused with Cascade Mountain Spring Water from Oregon,” according to its website.
In 2014, vodka lovers in over 30 states enjoyed selections that included a Green Tea, Pomegranate Tea, Chai Tea, Peach Tea, and Sour Sop Tea. 
Braxton said at the time: “I am the only one that is doing teas, period. Not flavored, all natural. People are more health conscious of what they put into their bodies. I know I am.”
“People want something that is new, different and also as close as possible to natural to pair with their food.” 
Since then, the mother of three has carved a niche for herself in the spirit industry and she now has a host of clients, including the Marine Corps MWR, US Embassy in Moscow, US Embassy of Columbia, US Embassy of Libya & the American Embassy of Lome.
Her next year’s 4,600-square-foot cafe and bar in Wheatley Heights, New York will serve as her company’s headquarters and training facility for her 300 franchisees who are ready to work with her.
Featuring food items such as wraps and muffins as well as drinks from other local businesses, the cafe will have meeting rooms for members of the community, and Braxton is hoping to partner with companies such as Microsoft for free classes, reports Newsday.
Having people from her background at heart, the retired structural engineer said she chose Wheatley Heights for her café because out of about 5,100 residents, more than 60 percent are black and Latino.
“I have plenty of places I could go,” said Braxton. “But I wanted to take the opportunity for people who look like me to see what I’m doing for the community so that they can step up and do the same thing.”
“I’m using a lot of small, minority, women and veteran-owned vendors, who never had the chance with larger places,” she said. “It’s economic inclusion for everyone.”
Braxton is one of the few black females making it big in the male-dominated spirits industry despite the challenges.
Recently, Fawn Weaver, who is the first female colored person to run a major whiskey brand, opened a new whiskey distillery in honor of Nearest Green, the enslaved African American who taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey.
Author and entrepreneur Weaver met with Nathan ‘Nearest’ Green’s descendants, who gave her the permission to put his name on a bottle and start the Uncle Nearest whiskey company.
It is her way of honoring the man known as the Godfather of Tennesee whiskey and leading a movement to ensure that his whiskey legacy lives on for generations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Desert to Power Initiative gains momentum in Burkina Faso</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The board of directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a €48,82 million ($54 million) loan to the government of Burkina Faso for the Yeleen solar plant, intended to boost national power supply.
Yeleen, which is to be implemented under the Bank’s Desert to Power (DTP) Initiative, and which will span a period of five years from 2020-2024, is the second project under the DTP initiative in Burkina Faso.
The total project cost is estimated at €136.69 million. The rest of the financing for Yeleen is provided by Agence Française de Développement (AFD), European Union (EU), and Société Nationale d'électricité du Burkina Faso (SONABEL).
The electricity access rate in Burkina Faso is one of the lowest in Africa at around 21% at national level in 2018.
Upon completion, the project will increase and diversify electricity supply through the construction of four new 52 MWc photovoltaic (PV) plants and extend power distribution networks to connect 30,000 new households, or about 200,000 people. It will also contribute to the avoidance of 48,000 tCO2eq emissions annually.
Wale Shonibare, the Bank’s Acting Vice-President for Power, Energy, Climate Change & Green Growth said: “This project will augment the Bank’s efforts to ensure inclusive access to energy through improvements in rural electrification, regional interconnections and energy sector reforms. Notably, it will increase Burkina Faso’s generation capacity by 15%, which will greatly help to reduce Burkina Faso’s reliance on fossil fuel imports.”
Dr Daniel Schroth, the Bank’s Acting Director for Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency also added that the approval would further the Desert to Power Initiative’s momentum in line with commitments made at the Sahel G5 Summit on 13th September in Ouagadougou. 
“With this project, we are making concrete progress on two of the five priority areas under the Desert to Power initiative which include adding new solar generation capacity and strengthening the transmission and distribution networks,” said Schroth.
The current project is part of Burkina Faso’s broader 2025 Solar Programme, known as “Yeleen” with three components:
The rural electrification “ Yeleen rural electrification project" which aims to increase electricity access in Burkina Faso by connecting 150,000 households to solar mini- grids (50,000 household) and through stand-alone solar kits systems (100,000 households) was approved by the Bank in December 2018 with joint financing with EU and GCF.
The Desert to Power initiative aims to accelerate economic development by adding solar energy generation capacity of up to 10GW by 2025 through a combination of public and private interventions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barack and Michelle Obama Just Bought a Beachfront Mansion on Martha’s Vineyard</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are two of the latest residents of Martha’s Vineyard, which is located off the coast of Massachusetts.
According to the Vineyard Gazette, the couple dropped $11.75 million after the asking price was originally $14.85 million.
The nearly 7,000 square foot home, which sits on 29 acres, has seven bedrooms, eight and a half baths, an outdoor swimming pool, a boathouse, sun decks and balconies, a number of stone fireplaces, as well as its own private view of the ocean. It’s also located in Edgartown, Mass., next to the Edgartown Great Pond.
On Wednesday, the house was sold by Wycliffe Grousbeck — who owns the Boston Celtics — and Corinne Basler Grousbeck, and purchased through a trust.
Reportedly, the former first family vacationed on Martha’s Vineyard in previous summers, and they rented the mansion before they bought it. The beloved couple also both attended Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and possibly became familiar with the vacation area a long time ago.
And their eldest daughter Malia Obama is currently an undergrad student at Harvard University, so the state of Massachusetts has clearly been a major part of the Obamas’ life.
A few photos of the mansion have already hit the internet, which show a huge kitchen with wooden floors and white walls.
Plus, a dining area can be seen with large windows all around it, and there’s an incredibly spacious living room that shows how high the ceiling is and a separate lounge area with its own view of the ocean can be seen too.
Neither the Obamas or the listing agents, Gerret Conover and Thomas LeClair of LandVest Martha’s Vineyard, have spoken about the purchase. Nor have the Grousbecks.
Martha’s Vineyard is known as a popular destination area for the well-off.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grave danger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAYING that inexperienced motorcycle taxis with no track record will put commuters’ lives in danger, the Lawyers for Commuter Safety and Protection (LCSP) filed a petition for injunction with application for a temporary restraining order against five motorcycle taxi companies hoping to penetrate the market.
“The commuting public should not be used as guinea pigs by fly-by-night motorcycle taxi operators with zero track record,” said Atty. Ariel Inton of  LCSP who, together with Atty. Raymond Fortun,  filed the petition.
In a press briefing held yesterday, Inton, speaking in behalf of LCSP, said that the commuter safety advocates filed the petition against We Move Things Philippines Inc. (Joyride), Habal Rides Corp., I-Sabay, Sampa-Dala Corp., and Trans-Serve Corp. The petition stated that their operations are unauthorized and may cause grave and substantial damage to the public.
Inton, a former Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) member, said that the LCSP’s main thrust is to promote commuter safety and uphold the rights of commuters, road users and pedestrians to a safe Mode of  transportation. As such, Inton stated, it has an absolute right to prevent respondents from organizing its fleet of motorcycles for hire and avert its operations which prejudice the riding public.
“The respondents are currently sabotaging the government’s pilot program for motorcycle taxis by unilaterally according to themselves the privilege to operate motorcycles for hire in the guise of addressing the traffic situation in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and other urban cities,” Inton stressed.
“At the outset, it should be pointed out that respondents commenced the roll-out of their motorcycle taxi business without any franchise from Congress or permit nor authority from the Department of Transportation (DOTr),” he added.
According to the petition letter that the LCSP submitted to the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City Tuesday, December 3, “Combined, thousands of motorcycles illegally booking and transporting passengers ply the roads, unduly exposing petitioners’ members to road hazards and increased risk of accidents.”
Inton stressed that motorcycle taxi operations are being conducted outside of the pilot program of the DoTr, defeating entirely the essence of the ongoing pilot testing and exposing the riding public to grave risks.
“Di puwedeng ikumpara ang motorcycle taxi sa milk tea na nang mauso ay ang dami nang nagsulputan kahit na mababa ang kalidad. Pero higit na mapanganib kung motorcycle taxi ang pinag-uusapan dahil buhay ng pasahero, buhay ng tao ang malalalagay sa peligro kung papayagan ang mga walang experience at walang track record na motorcycle taxi na makapasada,” said Inton.
“We have requested an immediate restraining order to prevent grave and irreparable damage to the riding public in general, and to the pilot program in particular,” stressed Atty. Raymond Fortun of LCSP. “Moreover, any accident during this critical period will also sabotage the pilot program,” he added.
Early this year, the House of Representatives passed Resolution No. 2449 urging the DoTr to implement a pilot program allowing, monitoring, and regulating the operation of duly registered and organized motorcycles-for-hire as an alternative public transport utility.
The DoTr then instructed various agencies to form a Technical Working Group (TWG) composed of stakeholders and experts from the government and the private sector to discuss issues attendant to the prospect of two-wheel vehicles operating as public transport.
Atty. Inton is also a member of this TWG and participated in the assessment sessions held prior to the recommendation of the pilot run.
The TWG was tasked to identify motorcycle types eligible to be licensed, taking into consideration factors like engine displacement, carrying capacity, operating speeds, routes, seat and helmet requirements, and training requirements for drivers, who will eventually need to obtain a public utility vehicle (PUV) registration.
Upon the recommendation of the TWG, the DoTr allowed the six-month pilot test for motorcycle taxi operations in the Philippines starting in July of this year. Since only the motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas had been established and operating with an eight-month track record at the time, Angkas became the sole subject of the pilot program which will end in December.
The five motorcycle taxi companies which are identified as the respondents in the LCSP petition are neither accredited by the TWG nor part of the pilot program.
“It bears stressing that the pilot program was undertaken precisely in view of the absence of any legal framework currently regulating motorcycle ride-hailing apps,” Fortun declared.
“Its objective is to ‘road test’ the operation of a motorcycle ride-hailing app to enable the government agencies to ascertain the safety and viability of its operations and, more importantly, to allow the agencies to craft the appropriate regulatory framework based on the data that would be gathered during this period of experimentation,” Fortun added.
In turn, Inton stressed that the pilot period, by its very nature, cannot be considered free for all who might want to engage in the same business precisely because of the absence of any law policy regulating the activity. “It will be far too precarious to expose the riding public to the risks of allowing zero-track record entities to operate a motorcycle ride hailing app without the proper regulatory framework yet in place,” he noted.
The five motorcycle taxi companies identified as respondents in the petition were reported to have surfaced and have begun the onboarding of motorcycle bikers and commenced accepting bookings for the transport of passengers.
To date, Joyride has already onboarded 3,000 bikers and have constructed their own office where recruitment is currently done. “These bikers are also at risk of performing an illegal activity considering that Joyride currently does not possess the necessary permit or authority from the DoTr,” the petition states.
In turn, I-Sabay 24/7 and Sampa both make use of an application for drivers and passengers and have started operations already. Transi-Serve Corp. has reportedly begun onboarding efforts as well.
“All of these acts are being done by respondents without having been made part of the Pilot Program for motorcycle taxis,” Inton stressed.  “Their reckless and brazen conduct of pre-empting the government agencies in hopes that they too might eventually be included in the pilot program despite lack of track record and qualifications only prove how the government and the public cannot trust these entities,” he added.
“Untested motorcycle taxi operators, such as respondents, expose commuters to the hazards posed by an unsafe mode of transportation,” Inton declared. “The unwarranted and unauthorized establishment and operation of motorcycle taxi fleet constitutes willful and blatant disregard of the rights of the commuting public in relation to safe modes of public transportation.”
Inton also raised the issue of the TWG continuing to meet without the presence of critical members, which is highly irregular.
“It has also come to my attention that the TWG, in which I am also a member, has been deciding on certain matters without some of its members,” Inton revealed. “Since the start of the pilot run, I have never been invited to meetings and discussions and now I heard that they have been convening, which is not only irregular but rather suspicious and unacceptable,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peaceful Hong Kong march marred by fire outside court, police say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hong Kong: Hong Kong protesters set fire outside court buildings, threw petrol bombs and spray-painted graffiti on government buildings, marring what was otherwise a "generally peaceful" march over the weekend, police said on Monday.
The comments came as protesters called for strikes across the city on Monday. Most railway and transport links ran smoothly during the morning rush hour and there were no initial reports of widespread disruptions.
Vast crowds of black-clad demonstrators thronged the streets of the Asian financial hub on Sunday, in the largest anti-government rally since local elections last month and a resounding show of continued support for the pro-democracy movement.
While the march appeared to be largely peaceful - in marked contrast to other mass demonstrations over the last six months, where protesters fought pitched battles with police - authorities said there was some damage after it ended.
"Although the event was generally peaceful, acts of breaching public peace happened afterwards," police said in a statement on Monday.
"Some rioters spray-painted the exterior walls of the High Court, threw petrol bombs and set fire outside the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, damaging government properties and seriously challenging the spirit of the rule of law," police said, adding that shops and banks were vandalised in the Causeway Bay and Wan Chai areas.
Protesters estimated the turnout at 800,000, while police said 183,000. In an editorial, the official China Daily newspaper called on the Hong Kong government to uphold the rule of law.
"Many residents in Hong Kong are fed up with the violence and disruption that have plagued the city for months," said the newspaper, often used by Beijing to put out its message.
Hong Kong's new police commissioner had said he would take a "hard and soft approach" to the demonstrations, where acts of violence would be treated harshly but other issues more flexibly.
DENIED ENTRY TO MACAU
Two leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong were denied entry over the weekend to the neighbouring Chinese city of Macau, without explanation.
Macau's security chief, Wong Sio Chak, on Monday said security concerns were the only reason for barring entry into the city, broadcaster RTHK reported.
AmCham Chairman Robert Grieves and President Tara Joseph had been traveling to Macau for an annual ball. The pair were told to sign a statement saying they "voluntarily agreed not to pursue entry to Macau".
Wong declined to comment specifically on their cases and said it was speculation that their refusal was linked to Beijing's response to U.S. legislation backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, RTHK said.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, linking the former British colony's special treatment under U.S. law to its autonomy from Beijing.
The unrest in the city of about 7.4 million people started in June as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition to mainland China. It has since morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and sometimes violent protests.
Protesters have set out five demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into alleged police brutality.
China has repeatedly blamed foreign powers, including the United States, for stirring up the unrest.

Reuters reporters at the march on Sunday saw graffiti and protesters setting up barricades, but were not in the vicinity of the other incidents.
The Hong Kong Bar Association condemned what it called “acts of arson and vandalism” and said those responsible must be brought to justice.
Protesters estimated the turnout at 800,000, while police said it was 183,000.
Police said they arrested 42 people over the weekend for rioting, possessing weapons and other charges. Some 6,022 people have now been arrested in relation to the unrest since early June, police said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Never say never again’ says Ruth Davidon on return to politics after stepping down in 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Speaking to The Courier on a recent visit to Angus, Ms Davidson said she missed making the decisions which directed the party, but not all of the other aspects of being the front and centre of Scotland’s second largest party, especially during election times.
The Fife-educated MSP announced she was stepping down earlier this year but has still campaigned at the forefront during the general election campaign – including in Angus where the latest polls suggest there is only 1% separating the SNP candidate Dave Doogan and the Tory’s Kirstene Hair ahead of Thursday’s vote.
Speaking of Ms Hair, she said it was important constituencies had MPs which “emulate the place they live”, adding she was young, articulate and someone who had “taken on the government”.
Having a young child had not shifted her politics, she added, but the Scottish Conservatives had always been a different beast from the main UK party through its history of Liberal Unionism.
Ms Davidson was criticised heavily after she was given a role with Tulchan Communications which would have paid £50,000 for 25 days’ work a year while still an MSP. She has since turned down the job.
When asked if she had plans to return to frontline politics, Ms Davidson said: “Never say never again. And I mean, I’ve been quite clear that I’m going to fulfil my responsibilities to the constituency and also to the party.
“Jen and I have talked before publicly about wanting another child and I think that I certainly wouldn’t be making any long term decisions. You know, obviously I’ll have to get another job – something that’s a bit more normal hours, because even backbench MPs have evening events they’ve got to go to, they’ve got the work weekends, you’re on call tonight.
“I think it’ll be something a bit more normal hours until the kids get to primary school. So, you know, five or six years, I may not want to come back and be desperate to come back.”
Angus Lib Dem candidate Ben Lawrie has written to Ms Hair calling on her to rule out supporting no-deal Brexit.
He said: “You have said you are prepared to sign up to Boris Johnson’s deal, despite his decision to abandon legal commitments to maintain alignment with EU regulation protecting the environment and workers’ rights, and the significant additional burdens it places on businesses trading with the EU. However, given the commitments in your manifesto not to extend the negotiation deadline, it now appears you are also content to see the UK crash out of the EU without a deal. You and I both know that this is unacceptable.
“So, I am asking you to unequivocally reject a no-deal Brexit and to commit to not voting for any plan that would allow the continued risk of such severe economic damage to Angus.
SNP candidate Dave Doogan last week wrote to Labour voters, asking for their vote to help “keep the Tories out” of Angus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Court challenge to federal ban on needles for drug-using prisoners postponed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO - A court hearing to challenge the federal government's ban on needles for drug-using prisoners has been postponed until next week in the latest delay for a case that began seven years ago.
Monday's hearing before the Ontario Superior Court was pushed back to Dec. 17 due to a medical emergency in the applicants' legal team.
The case, launched in 2012 by former prisoner Steven Simons, argues the current rules violate inmates' rights and expose them to serious blood-borne diseases.
Several HIV/AIDS advocacy organizations are also involved in the challenge, saying the federal government must meet its legal obligation to protect the health of people in prison.
“Let me state in the strongest possible terms: prison health is public health,” Simons said outside court Monday.
“Most prisoners in Canada will return home, bringing any illnesses they've contracted in prison with them. A prison needle and syringe program protects all Canadians.”
Simons, who spent more than a decade in a federal penitentiary before his release in 2010, said he tested positive for hepatitis C after another inmate used his injection equipment without his consent or knowledge.
The government has argued in court filings that giving clean drug-injection needles to prisoners would make federal facilities more dangerous, since syringes could be used as weapons.
The Correctional Service last year launched a program that offers inmates in some facilities access to sterile equipment. Lawyers representing the department said Monday the program is currently available in roughly half a dozen prisons, and will eventually be rolled out to all 43 federal facilities.
Applicants in the court challenge are expected to argue that the program, which requires inmates to be approved for participation, infringes on their rights due to its lack of confidentiality.
“Prisoners do not trust it. There is no working program in the world that uses this approach, which operates as a very strong barrier to access,” the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network said in a statement.
“At the same time, the (program) exists only in a handful of prisons and remains vulnerable to cancellation,” the organization said, adding the federal Conservatives have vowed to cancel it if they form government.
However, the judge overseeing the case has asked both sides to discuss whether it should be put on hold until the program has been in place long enough to be evaluated, which could push it back to late next year.
Simons said he hoped the case would not face further delays.
“It puts more prisoners at risk because they're still sharing, so they need to get this moving quickly,” he said outside court.
A hearing was initially scheduled last month, but the case was put over.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- An Ontario court is set to hear today a constitutional challenge to the federal ban on needles for drug-using prisoners.
The case, launched in 2012 by former prisoner Steven Simons, argues the current rules violate inmates' rights and expose them to serious blood-borne diseases.
Several HIV/AIDS advocacy organizations are also involved in the challenge, saying the federal government must meet its legal obligation to protect the health of people in prison.

The Correctional Service last year launched a program that offers inmates in some facilities access to sterile equipment.
But court filings say the program is currently only available in a handful of Canada's 43 federal prisons.
Applicants in the court challenge are also expected to argue that the program infringes on prisoners' rights due to its lack of confidentiality.
A rally in support of harm reduction in prisons is also scheduled this morning outside the Toronto courthouse.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologizes for Santa sweater with drug reference</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(CNN) - Walmart apologized for selling sweaters that appear to show Santa Claus with lines of cocaine.
The sweater has the words "Let it snow" and includes three white lines in front of Santa.
Part of the description said, "The best snow comes straight from South America." It added "Santa really likes to savor the moment when he gets his hands on some quality, grade-A, Colombian snow."
Walmart said the sweater was sold online in Canada by a third-party vendor and has been removed.
The company said the sweaters do not represent its values.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 51-year-old man will go on trial next year charged with the murder of a 12-year-old boy who was killed in a hit-and-run outside his school in Essex.
Harley Watson died in hospital after a vehicle ploughed into children who were leaving Debden Park High School in Loughton shortly before 3.20pm on December 2.
Terence Glover, of Newmans Lane, Loughton, is charged with his murder and the attempted murder of a woman and nine children.
They are 23-year-old Raquel Jimeno and six boys and three girls aged between 12 and 16 who cannot be named due to a court order.
He wore a green and yellow tracksuit as he appeared before Chelmsford Crown Court.
The defendant remained seated during the nine-minute hearing which was conducted on a video link from Chelmsford Prison, where he is remanded in custody.
He was not asked for pleas during the hearing, and a formal plea hearing was set for January 31 at Chelmsford Crown Court.
A provisional trial date was set for June 1 at Chelmsford Crown Court.
Judge Charles Gratwicke told Glover: “This matter is now adjourned to January 31 2020.
“You are remanded in custody. Thank you very much.”
The defendant replied: “Thank you.”
Harley was described by his family as a “good, kind, helpful and lovely boy”.
In a statement released through Essex Police, they said: “We are so devastated by what has happened.
“We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and concern.
“However as a family we would like people to respect our privacy and allow us to grieve in peace.”
Scores of well-wishers have donated to a GoFundMe.com fundraising page in his memory.

The 82-year-old will not appear in court himself for medical reasons, Anthony-Btesh said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jammu, Dec 09: The Pakistani Army on Saturday violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) at Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian security forces are retaliating to the unprovoked attack befittingly and the shelling is still going on heavily in the area.
According to reports, Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing of small arms and shelling with mortars in Shahpur Sector of J&K's Poonch district.
Ever since the abrogation of Article 370 which granted special status to the now-defunct state of Jammu and Kashmir, there have been 950 incidents of ceasefire violations between August and October in the Valley. The numbers were provided by Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik in Rajya Sabha on Monday.
The minister, however, told the House that every time there has been an unprovoked firing, the Indian Army has always retaliated befittingly to the enemy. Naik also added that all the ceasefire violations have neem taken up with Pakistani administration at appropriate levels.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A young woman was allegedly set on fire by a neighbour after she resisted his attempt to rape her, a police officer said here on Monday.
The 23-year-old victim, who suffered 50 per cent burns in the incident, was currently undergoing treatment at a hospital in the Muzaffarpur town, he said.
Based on a complaint filed by her mother with Ahiyapur police station, the accused has been arrested, Station House Officer (SHO) Vikas Rai said.
According to the complaint, the woman was alone at home on Saturday, when the accused, who lived close by, sneaked into her house and tried to rape her.
Her mother -- who works at a primary health centre -- rushed home and took her to a hospital after a local informed her about the incident, the SHO added.
Saturday's incident comes less than a week after charred bodies of two women, set afire after suspected rape and murder, were found in Buxar and Samastipur districts.
In another village in Ahiyapur police station area, the body of an eight-year-old girl was found on Friday - stuffed in a bag and dumped in an orchard after suspected sexual assault.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will Yash Dub For Himself In KGF: Chapter 2's Tamil Version?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yash went on to become a much-popular name among Tamil cine buffs with KGF: Chapter 1, the blockbuster Kannada movie, which was well-accepted all across India. While audiences are looking forward to the sequel to the film, Yash fans are eager to know whether he will be dubbing for himself in the Tamil version of this upcoming movie.
At a recent award function in Chennai, the actor took to the stage and addressed the audience in Tamil. He asked the audiences whether his Tamil is fine and added whether he could dub for himself in KGF: Chapter 2. Rocking Star mentioned that he will be crazier in the sequel and there will be more madness. His words have given an assurance that KGF: Chapter 2 will be even more special. The actor's words regarding the upcoming movie has left the fans pretty much excited.
In KGF, Yash plays the role of the protagonist named Rocky Bhai. The star's fan base increased numerous folds with this movie, which tasted huge success in Tamil as well. His performance in the film was loved by one and all. Most recently, a report also had come in that KGF: Chapter 1 emerged as one among the most-viewed Tamil movies on Amazon Prime. This would rightly sum up the popularity the film has enjoyed among Tamil movie audiences.
KGF has been directed by Prasanth Neel. The shoot of the sequel is currently progressing and Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt has been roped in to play the main antagonist. There are humungous expectations on this movie, which is also one among the most-anticipated films among the Tamil movie audiences as well. The film is expected to release in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam. KGF: Chapter 2 will be hitting theatres next year and an official announcement regarding the exact release date of the movie is being awaited.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beleaguered DR Congo rainforest attacked on all sides</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kisangani, DR Congo: Lush rainforest covers millions of hectares of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a central part of Earth's natural defence against global warming -- but it is under severe threat from a perfect storm of mismanagement and corruption.
An array of global and local NGOs are in a tense fight to save the rainforest, which lost an area twice the size of Luxembourg last year alone, according to Global Forest Watch.
But the problems run right through DR Congo society -- from the poor who rely on charcoal for fuel in a country with meagre supplies of other power, to the senior officials who profit from illegal logging.
"There are lawmakers and soldiers involved. They don't pay taxes -- it's unfair competition," says Felicien Liofo, head of a wood craftsmen's association.
Local police say soldiers simply rip apart the fences around the forest and threaten to shoot anyone who tries to stop them.
NGOs fight back
The government faces a daunting challenge to protect the rainforest.
Its 2002 forestry code imposed a moratorium on new concessions and regulated the number of trees that could be chopped down under existing permits, but officials complain of a lack of resources.
Felicien Malu, a provincial environment coordinator, has roughly 1,200 workers to cover a province twice the size of Portugal.
But his staff, he says, are not paid and lack even the basic tools of their trade -- boats, motorcycles or pickup trucks.
"We can't organise control missions because there are many rivers to cross and unpaved roads," he says.
His predecessor in the job was suspended for embezzlement, underlining how corruption feeds the problem of deforestation.
NGOs have launched a multi-pronged attack against the plunder.
Greenpeace Africa and a coalition of eight NGOs from DRC and neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville have demanded a halt to all industrial activities in the millions of hectares of peatland shared by the two countries.
The ancient wetlands store huge amounts of carbon, but companies are involved in oil exploration, logging and industrial agriculture in the area.
Global Witness investigated the illegal logging trade and earlier this year accused a general in the Congolese army of illegally reselling logging permits.
However, DRC remains impoverished and electricity is a rare luxury, meaning that most Congolese still rely on charcoal as their main fuel supply.
Making charcoal involves chopping down trees and slow-burning the wood in covered ovens -- all of which comes at a steep price for the environment.
"I get through a $30 sackful every two months. That's a fair chunk of what I earn," says Solange Sekera while shopping at a market in the eastern city of Goma. "We have no other means of preparing meals."
'Our forests may disappear'
The trade in charcoal -- known locally as makala -- is worth millions of dollars and it is attracting armed groups to the Goma area, threatening Virunga natural park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas.
More than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) to the west, the reliance on charcoal in Kinshasa is also causing severe problems.
Kinshasa residents consume five million tonnes of wood a year, according to French research group Cirad, and increasing urbanisation is just raising the pressure on the forests.
On the hillsides around the capital, there are scarcely any trees left.
NGOs and the government are once again trying to respond.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is trying to minimise the impact of charcoal burning by introducing "eco makala" ovens that burn the fuel more efficiently and so use less wood.
And President Felix Tshisekedi is trying to boost electricity across the country to reduce demand for wood-based fuel.
He has championed hydroelectric power -- and ground was broken in early October on a new dam in Goma.
NGOs and locals are not convinced of the viability of the project, but Tshisekedi is adamant: "Given the current rate of population growth and our energy needs, our forests may disappear by the year 2100," he says.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Earl of Yarmouth and his wife who were 'evicted' from the family's £85million estate by his aunt and parents reveals he 'regrets' the bitter row because his siblings are no longer speaking to him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Earl and Countess of Yarmouth have defended their decision to speak out against his family, after claiming they evicted him following a fallout in the summer.
William Francis Seymour, 26, revealed in July how his family asked him to leave the cottage on the estate called The Bothy that he was living in with his then-pregnant wife Kelsey Wells, a city high-flyer, 34.
As the firstborn son to Hugh Seymour, 8th Marquess of Hertford, William is heir to the £85m estate Ragley Hall, a magnificent Palladian mansion set in 5,000 acres, and has now said his three siblings have stopped speaking to him since his decision to speak about the family rift.
William, whose ancestors include Henry VIII’s third wife, Jane Seymour, has now said that he and his wife have no regrets about 'setting the record straight' over the reported campaign of hostility they reportedly faced, which peaked when his aunt Lady Carolyn called him a 'pompous a**' in her RSVP to the couple’s wedding in June last year - even correcting the font and coronet they  used.
Speaking to Tatler, William revealed how his his three siblings, Lady Gabriella Helen Seymour, 28, Lord Edward George Seymour, 24, and Lady Antonia Louisa Seymour, 21, have barely spoken to him in the months after he spoke out against his family. 
Revealing that he just received one brief message from one sister reading 'WTF' following the interview, he said: 'On a personal level one big regret I have about what has been going on with my parents is that it has got in the way of the relationship I could have had with my sisters and brother.'
Ensuring that his son's upbringing would be different from his own, he added: 'I really want to ensure that my son can talk to me about anything and everything.' 
Revealing why they spoke out about their situation, Kelsey, who reportedly gave birth this week, said: ‘The eviction of the Marquess of Hertford’s son from the family estate was not something that would go unnoticed, and rumours were beginning to circulate locally. 
‘We wanted to ensure that the historical record was accurate and felt it was appropriate to tell the real story.’ 
She added: 'I didn't ever see it as marrying into aristocracy. We should not define ourselves by the titles we have, or by association with an estate that one of us might have been fortunate enough to inherit. 
The couple briefly moved into Kelsey's parents' home after being evicted, before settling in a small cottage on the edge of the estate that William inherited from his grandfather. 
Speaking about the cottage they have, he joked: ‘You could fit the entire square footage of this cottage into the Great Hall at Ragley’. 
In July the couple told how the hostility began when William first started dating Kelsey, and his bedroom and car was reportedly lent to other staff members in an 'effort to keep them from seeing each other'.
Kelsey told how she felt as though the family's reported attitude towards her stemmed towards their fear of 'losing control of their son', and says they never warmed to her. 
They then revealed how his aunt had written an astonishing response to their 2018 wedding invite, replying: ‘[It’s] so embarrassingly awful, it’s almost laughable, if it weren’t so tragic. Since when do you start with the groom’s coronet on top of the page?
‘Moreover, you haven’t even used the Ragley blue nor the correct font. And since when does your name come before the bride?’
She went on to berate William for suggesting how guests might dress. ‘Good God, what are you? Little Lord Fauntleroy?’ She then beseeched him to teach his fiancee the rules of etiquette: ‘I am The Lady Carolyn Seymour,’ she said, before signing off: ‘You pompous a**/t**/p***k – take your pick… Your ever-so loving aunt’.
The couple now say they are following in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's footsteps and say they plan to 'thrive, not just survive', and hope to mend bridges with his family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Delhi court allows Robert Vadra to travel abroad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Monday allowed Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, to travel abroad for medical treatment and business purposes. Vadra is facing a probe under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, following allegations of money laundering related to purchase of a property in London at 12, Bryanston Square, worth 1.9 million pounds.
Special Judge Arvind Kumar granted permission to Vadra to go to Spain for two weeks from today.
The court directed him to submit a fixed deposit receipt (FDR) of Rs 25 lakh and his contact details and address of his stay abroad.
In June, it had allowed him to travel to the US and the Netherlands for six weeks on account of health reasons. The court, however, had not allowed Vadra to go to the United Kingdom.
The ED had expressed apprehension that the accused may destroy the evidence if allowed to go to the UK.
On April 1, Vadra was directed not to leave the country without prior permission by the local court, which had granted him conditional anticipatory bail.

The winger scored his first goal for the club on his 66th appearance to open the scoring after just 11 minutes, drilling home a low shot into the bottom corner.
He then went on to claim yet another assist for the campaign, delivering the cross for Armand Gnanduillet to head home Blackpool's third goal of the game.
The 33-year-old has now created nine goals for the Seasiders in League One this season and 12 in all competitions.
Feeney is joined by the likes of Kiko Casilla (Leeds United), Jarrod Bowen (Hull City) and Steven Fletcher (Sheffield Wednesday) in the team of the week, which recognises standout individual displays.
Bristol Rovers boss Graham Coughlan, meanwhile, is named manager of the week after his side came from behind to defeat Southend United 4-2 on Saturday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Archipalago aka Palago Mufasa has attacked Shatta Wale for hiring a chopper just to get Cardi B’s attention.
Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale yesterday pulled a surprise after he showed up at the Accra Sports stadium for his soundcheck with a helicopter before heading to his hotel room to rest ahead of the concert later in the evening.
Some few hours after this, Shatta Wale took to social media to laugh at the celebrities who had gone to the Kempinski Grand Hotel to have a ‘Meet and Greet’ session with Cardi B but were disappointed.
That didn’t end there as he posted on his page again hammering on the fact that Ghana is still a village.
He posted: “WHEN I SAY GHANA BE VILLAGE…..DEM GO TALK SAY WHY”
But Archipalago who has been trolling the celebrities after the incident sent an epic respond to Shatta Wale
He responded: “U made it look more village by hiring a helicopter just for #CardiB to recognize you ???Kwasia Banku Abeteku”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">State-run trading firm MMTC has already floated a tender for buying 21,090 metric tonnes (MT) of onions from Turkey and Egypt and the shipments are expected to arrive mid-January
The central government has given its approval to import of 36,090 metric tonnes of onions amid the ongoing supply crunch. Of this, 21,090 metric tonnes of onions are already contracted, which includes 6,090 metric tonnes from Egypt and 15,000 metric tonnes from Turkey, while the government will issue tenders for 15,000 metric tonnes of onions. The country had last imported 1,987 tonnes of onion in FY16, which happens to be the only year India imported onions in the last five years.
State-run trading firm MMTC, which is importing onions on the behalf of the government, has already floated a tender for buying 21,090 metric tonnes (MT) of the key kitchen staple from Turkey and Egypt and the shipments are expected to arrive mid-January. Of this, MMTC has contracted 4,000 MT of onions from Turkey which is expected to arrive by mid-January, 2020. This 4,000 MT is in addition to the 17,090 MT of onions already contracted which includes 6,090 MT arriving from Egypt and 11,000 MT from Turkey. The delivery from Egypt is expected in second week of this month, while import from Turkey is expected in the last week of December.
The department of consumer affairs has also directed MMTC to issue three more tenders for import of onions, out of which two tenders are country-specific, namely Turkey and European Union, and one is a global tender. Each of these tenders is for 5,000 MT.
On November 20, the union cabinet had given its nod to import up to 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of onions after retail onion prices touched a high of over Rs 100 per kg in some parts of the country. MMTC has been directed to import up to 1 lakh tonnes of the commodity from the global market.

The move comes after the government's various efforts to boost the domestic availability failed to curb retail prices. Retail onion prices have touched above Rs 150/kg in some cities across India. Onion was sold at Rs 165/kg in Panaji (Goa), Rs 160/kg in Mayabunder (Andaman) and Rs 150/kg in Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode on Friday.
Onion prices shot up due to 26 per cent decline in production at 52.06 lakh tonnes during the kharif season of 2019-20 as untimely and prolonged rains caused damage to crop.

The Centre has already taken a decision to provide certain relaxations in the new tenders issued such as size range of onions have been expanded to 40mm-80mm, consortium bidding has been allowed, exporters can offer shipment in multiple lots. Adding to it, fumigation condition relaxations that were earlier provided till 30 November, 2019 have now been extended till 31 December, 2019. This is expected to further increase participation, competition and reduce price.
A coordination committee has also been formed by the department of consumer affairs to ensure that the entire process of import and distribution is streamlined so as to ensure timely arrivals and movement of onions and sale by states. The committee is holding meetings on a daily basis with participation from officials of MMTC, NAFED, CONCOR and associated ministries and departments.
The government has also planned procurement of domestically produced onions from major onion producing states. Onions procured from major onion producing states will be distributed across all consuming states as per the demand placed by them. On 3 December, 2019, the union government had revised stock holding limit on Onions to 25 MT on Wholesalers and 5 MT on Retailers. Importers will be exempted from these stock limits for imported stock.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Federico Fernandez: 'Newcastle need to build a winning mentality'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Magpies were far from their best against the Saints, but eventually secured a priceless 2-1 victory at St James' Park on Sunday to climb into the top half of the table at the end of a gruelling, but successful week.
A hard-fought 2-2 draw with champions Manchester City and back-to-back victories over Sheffield United and the Saints have left them on 22 points after 16 games, just two shy of fifth-placed Manchester United and confident of adding to their tally over a busy programme between now and the New Year.
Fernandez said: "We are working hard to keep our shape. We feel okay. We took our chances and they are great points.
"We need to enjoy this period and build a winning mentality. You never know where we can arrive at the end of the season, but we take it game by game."
This particular game will be one, other than the result, which Newcastle may well want to forget.
They were simply not at the races before the break and had to rely upon keeper Martin Dubravka to make two fine saves from Nathan Redmond.
Indeed, they did not really find their feet until after Danny Ings' 52nd-minute opener and even then only as a result of Andy Carroll's introduction in place of £40million summer signing Joelinton, whose crisis of confidence is ongoing.
Carroll subjected central defenders Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek to a physical onslaught and the only surprise was that it was he who provided the cross for Jonjo Shelvey to head the Magpies level with 22 minutes remaining rather than the other way around.
The direct approach paid dividends once again three minutes from time when the ball was cleared to another substitute, Sean Longstaff, and keeper Alex McCarthy could only parry his skidding drive to Fernandez, who needed no second invitation to dispatch it into the roof of the net.
He said: "I saw Longs have a great shot and I followed the ball. I was in the right place at the right moment. I was very happy to score here at home with all of the fans."
If there was satisfaction on Tyneside, there was frustration for Southampton as they headed off on the long journey back to the South Coast empty-handed despite enjoying the better of much of the game and creating a series of chances.
Manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: "That's the next step we have to go in such tight games, to be more clinical in that moment.
"In the third game in a week where we have invested a lot, it's normal that the concentration is not the highest when you have such moments, but in that moment, you must know that this can decide the game and that when you are one up, you must take something here.
"It's really a pity."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Though recently defeated in a senatorial rerun, Dino Melaye, a former member of the Senate, has been honoured with 'Man of the Year' award
- The award was presented by Garba Shehu, an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari
- Garba told the audience that he had come a long way with Melaye and that they had carried out projects together
The former senator representing Kogi West at the National Assembly, Dino Melaye, has won the ‘Man of the Year’ award just days after losing a return to the legislative chamber.
However, a mild drama ensued when the organisers of the award called Garba Shehu, a spokesperson of President Muhammadu Buhari, to present the award to the former senator.
The mention of Garba resulted in guests clapping and hailing in surprise.
Even Melaye, who was standing while his citation was read out, could not hold his laughter as well.

The drama continued as Garba came out, stood before Melaye, paused for a moment before speaking. This action further caused laughter in the audience.
Garba then asked jokingly after collecting the plaque to be presented to Melaye: “Should I just take this thing and leave him standing here?”
He told the guests that he had been close to Dino Melaye being that the duo had come a very long way. He added that they had worked together on many projects. He noted that politics has a way of bringing people together and also dividing them.
In his reaction after receiving the award, Melaye described Garba as his brother and friend. He confirmed that the two of them have a longstanding relationship beyond the current dispensation.

He has now added to his brilliant campaign by winning the "Cavour Trophy" after beating Chieri 3-2 in the final.
Ronaldo's eldest son, who scored three goals at the tournament, was named the best striker, as Giovani Bianconeri, who covers Juventus' youth teams, pointed out.
As a consequence, his father posted a picture of Cristiano Jr and the best striker trophy on Instagram, along with the captain: "I'm a proud daddy".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A young high school student died on Saturday while having sex with her lover. According to sources, the incident occurred at PamaStones Shopping Complex.
The girl who has only been identified as Daisy was a form three student at Highfield High 1 School.
However, her age was not revealed.
It is suspected that Daisy may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning which may have triggered an asthmatic attack, which resulted in her suffocating.
This is due to the fact, that Daisy and her boyfriend John were having their stolen moment of intimacy in the generator room at the local shops. John who is a tuckshop attendant at the shops nearly died as well.
A witness said,
Daisy’s family is reported to be unamused by John’s antics when Daisy was still alive. They have since demanded the full bride price from John before they can bury Daisy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Pankaj Mishra] India’s problems bigger than Modi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new narrative about India is suddenly emerging. Until very recently, India appeared to be a great democracy as well as a rising economic power, a potential partner of the West in its policy of containing China. Writing in Time magazine in 2015, no less a moral and political authority than Barack Obama hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as India’s “reformer-in-chief” who “reflects the dynamism and potential of India’s rise.”
However, the latest, radically different narrative about India holds that the country is flailing, its politics and civil society captured by a Hindu supremacist movement, and its economy trapped in a potentially long slowdown.
Evidence that India’s prime minister is not the smart economic modernizer he seemed to many in the West has become steadily incontrovertible, especially after he quixotically withdrew most currency notes in circulation in 2016.
This week, an exhaustively researched report in the New Yorker by Dexter Filkins provided spine-chilling evidence that India is ruled by cold-blooded ideological fanatics, who will use all means to achieve their aims. These can range from perversion of the media, judiciary and military to anti-Muslim pogroms, targeted assassinations of critics and collective punishment of a minority.
Such a dramatic reversal of reputations -- “from hero to zero,” as the Indian wisecrack goes -- is not new in India’s case. For much of India’s seven decades, when it appeared to be on the wrong side of the Cold War, Western commentators regarded the country as a basket case.
As Thomas Friedman put it in “The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century,” India was “known as a country of snake charmers, poor people, and Mother Teresa” before it was abruptly rebranded, including by Friedman, as a “country of brainy people and computer wizards.”
As India embraced market capitalism, moved away from its Russian friends and came closer to the West, every major Western periodical, from the Economist and Foreign Affairs to the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, started to broadcast the myth of an irresistibly “rising” India.
As India suffers another downgrade in global reputation, it is worth asking: How do fundamentally defective narratives acquire outsize influence? And, is the new narrative about India as simplistic and misleading as the old?
Certainly, it has long been clear that India, which failed to invest in primary education and health, did not have the human capital and infrastructure necessary for what it urgently needed: a labor-intensive manufacturing revolution of the kind that made such “East Asian Tigers” as South Korea and Taiwan.
Economic growth in India was built on such shaky foundations as speculative finance capital and construction, and never seemed strong and consistent enough to generate jobs for the approximately million people entering the workforce each month.
Nor was India robust enough to contribute effectively to the Western coalition against China. India humiliatingly lost a border war in 1962 and several subsequent diplomatic-military scuffles. It has not even come close to matching its neighbor’s economic performance.
But commentators were too bedazzled by such notions as (John McCain’s) “league of democracies” and too influenced in their thinking by a Cold War division of the world into blocs and counterblocs.
Many Indians living or educated in the West were seduced by the idea that their country, which once mortifyingly denoted elephants, Maharajahs and beggars to the average Westerner, was assuming its place among the elite nations.
As for those in the knowledge industry (academics, journalists, columnists, think-tankers), it is always tempting to set aside intellectual hesitations and moral scruples and stand with history’s seeming winners.
It will be no less tempting to recoil from its supposed losers. Indeed, as multiple crises rock India, from crippling bank debts to lynch mobs, many of its previous promoters repackage themselves as outspoken critics of Modi.
These unreliable narrators of India should not make us forget, however, that long before Modi came to power in 2014, the country’s economy had already developed its unhealthy dependence on finance, corruption and inequality were intolerable, and politicians accused of anti-minority pogroms revolved serenely through the corridors of power.
Torture and extrajudicial execution have been commonplace for decades, especially in Kashmir and insurgency-affected central India. In 2013, the Supreme Court sent a Kashmiri to the gallows on flimsy circumstantial evidence, arguing that “the collective conscience of the society will only be satisfied if the capital punishment is awarded to the offender.”
To India’s hollowed-out institutions, Modi has delivered a lusty kick; they have predictably collapsed into a heap. But the dust that rises from them should not again cloud our optics.
Modi is a symptom rather than the main cause of the country’s political degeneration and economic stagnation. Until this is acknowledged, it won’t be possible to correctly diagnose, let alone stem, India’s deepening rot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tech, climate change creating new inequalities: UN</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new generation of global inequalities fueled by climate change and technology could trigger violence and political instability if left unchecked, the United Nations warned on Monday.
Climate change and technology rather than wealth and income are the modern-day wedges that are increasingly dividing the haves from the have-nots, said the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in its 2019 Human Development Report.
These forms of inequality are rising as progress has been made in more traditional measures of inequality such as extreme poverty and disease, it said.
"Under the shadow of the climate crisis and sweeping technological change, inequalities in human development are taking new forms," the report said.
"The climate crisis is already hitting the poorest hardest, while technological advances such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can leave behind entire groups of people, even countries."
Allowing these new inequalities to grow could be "extremely dangerous and highly volatile," said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.
"Across the rich and emerging countries and also developing countries where a middle class has emerged, their reactions are increasingly violent," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of the report's release.
"If not managed well and practically, it will essentially manifest itself in what we see on the evening news - burning cars, burning buildings, burning infrastructure, millions of people in the streets protesting and overthrowing governments."
Street protests have filled the news of late, in Hong Kong, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela and elsewhere over an array of issues including rising prices, government policies, corruption and pro-democracy movements.
The UNDP report said climate change will fuel inequality as it hits developing countries, many with limited capacity to resist threats from malnutrition, disease and heat stress.
"So the effects of climate change deepen existing social and economic fault lines," it said.
As to technology's effect on inequality, the report said the proportion of adults with university-level educations was growing more than six times faster in highly developed countries than in lower developed countries.
It also said fixed broadband subscriptions were growing 15 times faster in developed countries.
"These are the inequalities that will likely determine people's ability to ... function in a knowledge economy," it said.
The changes come as many more people today no longer live in extreme poverty, Steiner said.
"Our aspirations have changed," he said. "People are not just looking at the dollars in their account. They are looking at opportunities, at social mobility and at freedom of choice."

The event is slated to commence from December 10th to 19th, 2019.
General Manager, Radio Lagos, Eko FM, Mrs. Ayo Sotonwa who disclosed this at a news conference, held in the corporation’s ground,  Ikeja, added that the opening ceremony of the home appliances fair would be held at the Eko FM multi-purpose hall on 10 to 16th, with a lecture by Oke-_Osanyintolu, who will speak on the topic: “safety at home.”
The lecture, according to her, aimed at ensuring and boosting safety culture at individual homes on how to prevent the avoidable disaster that could lead to loss of lives and properties.
Sotonwa explained that the fair is being organised as part of a commitment to promote household items and afford both manufactures and dealers in home appliances to interact and display products in order to attract more patronage from the public at affordable prices.
Sotonwa said it is expected at the end of the fair members of the public would have been introduced to a wide range of new products in the market and genuine not fake.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brussels: European Union foreign ministers debated Monday how to respond to a controversial agreement between Turkey and Libya that could give Turkey access to a contested economic zone across the Mediterranean Sea.The maritime border deal, endorsed by the Turkish parliament last week, has fueled tensions in Turkey’s long-running dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil and gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Greece has already expelled the Libyan ambassador over it.Before chairing the meeting, new EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that “it’s not a matter of sanctions today.” He said the ministers would study a “memorandum of understanding” agreed upon between Turkey and Libya, which was only made public in recent days.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said “it’s a little bit astounding how they split up the Mediterranean among themselves. We’ll have to see how we deal with it.”Greece, Cyprus, and Egypt, which lie between Turkey and Libya geographically, have blasted the accord as being contrary to international law. Some EU partners of Greece and Cyprus seem to agree.“The Netherlands is always a staunch supporter of the rule of international law, and we side with Greece,” said Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok. “International law should be upheld.”Although they are NATO allies, neighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NATO-China: New relationship challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Last week, leaders of its 29 member states gathered for a two-day summit in London. And for the very first time, the group in its joint statement named and mentioned China.
As Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, has put it, the alliance must “better understand the rise of China and what it means for our security in terms of opportunities and challenges.”
Stoltenberg pointed out that China is now the world’s second largest defense spender, and that there is a pressing need to incorporate Beijing into major arms control agreements that are concluded among the great powers in future.
He stressed that this was not “about moving NATO into the South China Sea”, and also denied that the decades-old military alliance trying to create a new enemy.
However, as China is now aggressively enhancing both its economic and military presence across the world, including in the Arctic Circle and in Africa, NATO needs to start taking “into account that China is coming closer to us,” Stoltenberg noted.
As we all know, the United States has remained the strongest stakeholder in NATO.
Now, as the alliance has chosen to officially respond to the rise of China at a time when the relationship between Washington and Beijing is continuing to deteriorate, it raises the possibility that a “New Cold War” between China and the West may be in the making.
In particular, as “containing China” has become a bipartisan consensus in the US, even if President Donald Trump fails to get his second term in the 2020 election, Washington is likely to just fine-tune, but not change drastically, the current policy line no matter who will be in charge of the White House in the future.
As far as China is concerned, it may be facing an equally severe challenge like the West. Now that it has come on to the NATO radar, and is shrouded heavily in the shadow of a “New Cold War”, the Asian giant’s path toward becoming the world’s next superpower may turn out to be a bumpy one.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: Around 10 senior employees of Asian securities firm CLSA’s India unit are likely to join rival Jefferies, ET NOW reported on Monday citing sources.
These include employees from research as well as sales division, report said.
CLSA analysts Mahesh Nandurkar and Ashish Agrawal are among those employees who are making the switch.
Emails sent to CLSA and Jefferies seeking a confirmation were not yet replied to.
Christopher Wood was appointed as global head of equity Strategy at Jefferies in May. Wood, one of the top-ranked market strategists, joined Jefferies from CLSA, where he spent around two decades.
Wood’s exit from CLSA earlier this year was the latest in a string of high-level resignations at the rocked Hong Kong-based securities firm in recent times.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A woman who was drugged and sexually assaulted by her flatmate was called a s**t in court by her attacker's girlfriend on Monday. 
The woman's flatmate had put the drug GHB, known as fantasy, in her drink when they had shared a bottle of wine and some vodka in August 2016. 
The woman became unconscious and woke up to the 34-year-old flatmate kissing her and her pants had been removed, the court heard according to The Gold Coast Bulletin. 
Toxicology tests showed there was GHB in her urine but she had never knowingly taken the drug. 
The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, had moved into the unit just two weeks before the incident. 
The now 37-year-old appeared in Southport District Court on Monday and plead guilty to one count of administering a drug for the purpose of sexual assault and sexual assault. 
He was sentenced to two years prison, suspended after six months. 
At the conclusion of proceedings the man's girlfriend walked passed the victim, who had been crying, and reportedly said s**t. 
She then followed that up by telling the woman: 'I am going to get you, you dog'. 
The defence barrister for the man said he was fully clothed during the assault and had undergone counselling since the incident. 
He also said the man's motivation was to make the woman more easily persuaded rather than to render her unconscious. 
When delivering the sentence, Judge Catherine Muir, however, said the attack was a serious breach of trust by the man who the woman had allowed to live in her unit.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Bill protesters burnt tyres, clashed with police and many raised slogans with swords in their hands in parts of Assam, as Home Minister Amit Shah gears up to table the Bill in Lok Sabha on Monday.
One protester sustained serious head injuries in a clash with police in the Dhemaji district in North Assam during the 12-hour Assam bandh called by the students' unions representing the Moran and the Chutia communities. The North East Students' Organisation (NESO), including the All Assam Students' Union, also called a bandh across the region on Tuesday. 
Upper Assam districts such as Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Majuli witnessed strong protests as thousands spilled onto the streets demanding the scrapping of the Bill. "We are ready to die but will never accept the Bill," one of the protesters shouted in front of television cameras in Dhemaji district. 
The Bill seeks to allow "religious persecuted minorities" from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan such as Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs, who had migrated till December 2014, to apply for Indian citizenship after a stay of six years. Organisations representing indigenous communities fear that such a move would reduce the ethnic communities into minorities and endanger their cultural identity. They want all foreigners, irrespective of religion, to be detected based on the March 24, 1971 cut-off date.
Many also staged protests in front of residence and offices of leaders of the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the regional ally of the BJP for not opposing the Bill. Many people belonging to the non-Muslim communities, whose names were left out of the NRC, however, are pinning hope on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill to end the uncertainty over their citizenship claim.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foreign observers find it difficult to understand the developments of the Lebanese situation and its sudden turns. This is not surprising. Lebanon is not a normal democracy, to which the known rules of such system apply.Lebanon’s democracy is bizzare. It resembles nothing but itself. A fragile democracy that is constantly on the brink of collapse and only escapes with treatments that today are no longer available.The Lebanese find it difficult to explain to non-Lebanese what is going on in the Land of Cedars. The game there is not governed by the accepted rules regarding elections, majority, and minority.It is not enough to reflect on the provisions of the constitution to understand the story. It is true there is a constitution that is supposed to regulate the life of this republic that is heading towards bankruptcy. But the constitution alone is not enough.There are turns, circumventions, and ambiguities, as well as the ingenuity of the designers of derogatory constitutional models, who have imaginations that exceed the skillful minds of the most famous fashion designers such as Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, and others.Unfortunately, the constitution is not the referee, nor has it the last say. In difficult seasons, it becomes the victim, not the guardian. Disregarding the constitution has become entrenched, as has the habit of disregarding the citizens.Lebanese political games seemed amusing and cute on normal days. But they are painful and provocative in a country that sends out distress calls, such as drifting ships at sea… A country, in which words such as collapse and bankruptcy are in all conversations… A country, where a citizen commits suicide for not being able to secure half a dollar for his daughter or sets himself on fire for his inability to provide bread or to pay school fees for his children.I don’t want to be too pessimistic and say that a beautiful Lebanon is just a lie that was invented by the Rahbanis and promoted by the scattered gold from the voice of Fairouz.I was willing to write about another topic. But what happened yesterday provoked me.The prevailing impression was that the binding parliamentary consultations, which President Michel Aoun was scheduled to conduct after a long wait and stalling, would result in the nomination of businessman Samir al-Khatib. The latter was expected to form the government that would face the most difficult task in Lebanon’s independent history, especially since the economic collapse is no longer an imminent threat, but rather a reality.According to rumors, the choice of Khatib would have freed the government from the burden of some ministers, who went too far in poisoning the Lebanese water of coexistence.Suddenly, Khatib, following a visit to Grand Mufti Abdullatif Derian, announced his withdrawal from the race, saying that the Sunni community was unanimous in supporting Saad Hariri as prime minister.Hariri had previously announced that he was not interested in forming the new government, after the other team insisted on a techno-political cabinet. He argued that only a technocrat government could help resolve the economic and financial collapse and address the international community.With the postponement of binding parliamentary consultations, it seemed clear that it was difficult to overcome what became known as the “Hariri node”.This node started since his father’s entry in the club of prime ministers in 1992 with an exceptional aura and as a striking force based on an arsenal of Arab and international relations, in addition to his financial capabilities.Hariri succeeded in becoming the axis around which the regime revolved, despite the Syrian tutelage in Lebanon. The search for the president of the republic began on the basis of who can control and obstruct Hariri, after it became difficult to continue without him.Despite the differences, the experience was repeated with Saad Hariri, who suddenly emerged in the Lebanese arena, carrying the coffin of his father, whose assassination in 2005 constituted a turning point in the turbulent life of the Republic and put it on the path of decline.The “Hariri node” was present in the elections and the formation of governments. His presence was imperative and his opponents had no option but to accept him, seek to obstruct him, and set ambushes to topple him whenever the opportunity aroused.The Hariri government was brought down at the hands of Aoun and his allies. But the man returned to the Serail because he was the strongest in his sect and because he kept most of the arsenal of international relations that his father engineered and excelled in maintaining.When the Hariri sect insists today on his appointment as prime minister, it acts in the same way as Michel Aoun’s allies, when they kept postponing the presidential elections to ensure his arrival as the figure who represents the most the Maronite community, and after the country suffered for years from what was known as the “Aoun node”.A third node in the current system is that of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. The State is unable to have a say on major issues without his approval.The past years have consolidated a dangerous norm. The strongest man in a sect or confession cannot be trespassed. This norm has distorted the Lebanese system, even if it was not translated in constitutional texts.There are those who are demanding the return of Hariri because he is the best able to address the Arab and international community, perhaps because he could save the Lebanese sinking ship. Others are calling for his return to be a partner in bearing the consequences of the collapse, as hopes for survival are diminishing.The dance of alliances and bickering between the Lebanese islands was taking place in a country that had long succeeded in postponing the hour of truth. But today, it is taking place in a country that witnesses the largest protest movement in its history amid rising poverty, unemployment, and bankruptcy.Politicians went too far in the game of coalitions and wrangling, and they did not stop at the signs of internal deterioration, nor at the US-Iranian tension line.Lebanon is a difficult story that transcends its men. It is a magnificent Rahbani lie, where the resounding voice of Fairouz rises above tremendous destruction.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hundreds spend the night in sleeping bags on Times Square</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jim O’Shea and Dan Niland sat atop a bright blue mat inside a secured pedestrian plaza in Times Square on Saturday, playing cards as they prepared for the night ahead.
Piles of pillows, yoga mats, sleeping mats and bags surrounded them. Others came with bags of chips or stuffed animals.
O’Shea and Niland did not know what to expect as they prepared to sleep in one of four designated plazas in Times Square along with some 900 others to raise awareness about homelessness.
Although he would spend the night in a sleeping bag with no food as temperatures dipped to the mid-20s, O’Shea said that when he returned to his Upper West Side home Sunday morning, he would come back to a bed, shower and heat.
“I can’t ever relate to the helplessness and hopelessness of being truly homeless because I really do have those keys in my pocket, but at least for one night we are creating awareness to imagine what it’d be like sleeping outside,” O’Shea, 54, said.
The gathering Saturday, called the World’s Big Sleep Out, was organised by Josh Littlejohn, the owner of a chain of Scottish sandwich shops and an advocate for providing jobs, shelter and housing for people who need them. He described homelessness as a crisis that all countries have an obligation to address.
Thousands of people agreed to sleep outside overnight in at least 50 cities, including New York, London and New Delhi, to raise awareness of the problem of homelessness and the need for money to fight it.
Like many who take part in charity walks or runs, participants in Littlejohn’s event have collected pledges for donations from supporters.
In New York, people committed to spending the night in sleeping bags in Times Square, surrounded by the area’s pulsating lights and neon signs. Actor Will Smith read a “bedtime story” to the crowd.
There was star power in other major cities. Musicians Jake Bugg and Tom Walker performed, and actress Helen Mirren read to participants in Trafalgar Square in London. Ziggy Marley, Ellie Goulding, Meghan Trainor and Sean Kingston entertained those taking part at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.
The sleep out, Littlejohn emphasised, was “in no way an emulation of actually being homeless.” But, he added, those who spend the night outside would “undoubtedly leave with a different sense of perspective and a heightened sense of compassion.”
There are an estimated 3,900 homeless people living on New York City’s streets. Just how dangerous such a life can be was underscored in October, when four homeless men were bludgeoned to death as they slept on the sidewalks of Chinatown in Manhattan. The accused killer, a 24-year-old man, was homeless himself.
Littlejohn has set a fundraising target of $50 million for his event. Half the money would go to non-profit groups that deal with homelessness in the communities where the donations come from, like the Coalition for the Homeless in New York.
The other half is to go to charities around the world like UNICEF that help people displaced not only by extreme poverty, but also by armed conflict and natural disasters.
The sleep out will be followed by a political drive led by the Institute of Global Homelessness, an advocacy group with a goal of eliminating unsheltered homelessness in 150 cities and countries by 2030. The group plans to work with governments in different countries to come up with ways of addressing the problem.
Louise Casey, a former British government official with expertise in social services, is the institute’s chairwoman. When Tony Blair was Britain’s prime minister, he appointed Casey as the country’s “homelessness czar.”
She said she was disheartened by the rising number of people living on the street in Britain and elsewhere. She recently visited California, where an increase in income inequality and a lack of affordable housing have combined to push many people into homeless encampments.
“I was shellshocked,” Casey said. “What in God’s name is happening here? I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve been to every continent.”
Littlejohn, 33, said he had no idea that he would become interested in finding international solutions to homelessness when he opened Social Bite, an Edinburgh sandwich shop, about seven years ago.
Pete Hart, who hawked The Big Issue, a magazine meant to give homeless people a way to make money without panhandling, was a fixture in front of the shop.
“He came into the cafe and he sort of plucked up the courage and he asked us if he could have a job,” Littlejohn said.
After Hart began working in the kitchen, he told Littlejohn that his brother Joe also lived on the street and needed a job.
Littlejohn was soon employing both brothers and their friends. He was also feeding up to 50 people a day, asking customers to “pay it forward” by buying meals that could be given to homeless people.
In 2016, in an early version of the event Saturday, Littlejohn persuaded about 270 Scottish business leaders to sleep overnight in an Edinburgh park to call attention to the problem. Last year, with land that had belonged to the City of Edinburgh, Social Bite opened about a dozen small homes as stable housing for people who had lived on the streets.
Joe Hart, 30, works in construction now and is no longer homeless. He said he found it hard to believe that asking for a job at the sandwich shop years ago had wound up making him a part of an international campaign to raise money and awareness for trying to end homelessness.
He recalled his own life on the streets and how poorly some passersby had treated him. “People look down on you,” he said, adding that some of them would even “be spitting on you.”
Hart said he hoped that Littlejohn’s campaign would make the public more sympathetic.
“It’s not everyone’s choice to end up on the street,” he said. “It’s not a choice to end up like that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka’s state broadcaster to air ‘Matir Projar Deshe’ on Dec 15</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sri Lanka’s state-owned Independent Television Network or ITN will broadcast a Bangladeshi film, ‘Matir Projar Deshe’.
The film will be aired at 10pm on Dec 15 with subtitles in Sinhalese, according to Goopy Bagha Productions Ltd and Bangladesh High Commission in Sri Lanka.
Arifur Rahman is the producer and Imtiaz Ahmed Bijon directed the movie.
“More than three million viewers will watch the movie in Bangla language,” the production house said in a statement.
This is a gift for Bangladesh’s Independence and Language Movement from Sri Lanka, just the day before Dec 16, it said.
“I don’t think a Bangladeshi film has been aired on the terrestrial television of any other country; I guess Sri Lanka is the pioneer,” High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah told bdnews24.com.
The state-owned TV station has prepared the subtitle for the film at its own cost, he said adding the initiative was made possible because of the continuation of Bangladesh Film Festival in Sri Lanka.
“I had a discussion with the ITN chairman on the issue a year back. Later, we’ve come up to this stage in a tripartite arrangement with the filmmakers and producers.”
Matir Projar Deshe was premiered at the Seattle International Film in 2016. It won the best film award at the Chicago South Asian Film Festival the same year. It was released in Bangladesh in 2018.
The cast includes Jayanta Chattopadhyay, Rokeya Prachy, Kachi Khandakar, Sheuli Akhter, Chinmoyee Gupta, Ramiz Raju, Abdullah Rana, Monir Ahmed Shakeel, Rikita Nandini Shimu and others. The cinematographers were Ramshreyas Rao and Andrew Wiseman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore's Tamil community over 2,000-year old: Book</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Tamil community has been present in South East Asia and Singapore for more than 2,000 years, according to a new book that explores the lesser-known aspects of Tamil history and heritage.
Titled 'From Sojourners To Settlers - Tamils in Southeast Asia and Singapore', the book was launched on Saturday by Singapore's Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran at the Indian Heritage Centre.
It explores the lesser-known aspects of Tamil history and heritage in South East Asia and Singapore, examining evidence of Tamil connections with the region for more than 2,000 years.
Among evidence looked at are the inscriptions on the Singapore Stone, which some experts say date back to the 10th century, The Straits Times reported.
A key artefact in Singapore's National Collection, the Singapore Stone was formerly located at the mouth of the Singapore River before the British destroyed it with dynamite in 1843.
Researcher Iain Sinclair, a contributor to the book, recently identified the phrase "kesariva" in the inscriptions found on parts of the Singapore Stone.
He said it could be part of the word "parakesarivarman" - a title used by several Chola kings of the Chola dynasty, a Tamil dynasty of southern India and one of the longest-ruling dynasties in history.
"The Tamil community in Singapore is clearly identifiable but not easily definable and any attempt to do so is fraught with challenges ranging from semantics to politics," Iswaran said.
Iswaran addressed the efforts by early Tamil pioneers in shaping Singapore's identity and laying the foundations of contemporary Tamil culture and practice in the city-state.
"Colonial Singapore was a microcosm of India's diverse cultural background and landscape - its vast, seemingly endless range of sub-ethnicities and linguistic groups," he said.
Iswaran noted that Tamil Muslims established Singapore's first vernacular press while Indian merchants and moneylenders, including the South Indian Chettiars, were the source of credit and banking before the advent of European banks in the 19th century.
"Today, Tamil is one of our four official languages, and community and state-supported efforts to promote the Tamil language and culture continue with vigour," he said.
English, Mandarin and Malay are the other official languages in Singapore.
"Tamil Singaporeans, who constitute a majority of the Indian population in our nation, are a vibrant and diverse community, who continue to play an important role in shaping Singapore's future," Iswaran said.
Besides Singapore, Malaysia has the largest number of Indians, majority of which are Tamilians.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Christmas at Sandringham is REALLY like: From 'viciously competitive' board games to Prince Philip's 'very strong' cocktails, experts reveal how the royal celebrations are 'wonderfully relaxed'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You might think that spending Christmas with the royal family would be a thoroughly formal affair.
But a documentary has revealed that royals celebrating Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham have a lot of fun, with the famous family enjoying 'very strong' cocktails mixed by Prince Philip, and fiercely competitive board games. 
Sandringham: The Queen at Christmas, which aired last night on Channel 5, revealed that the royals arrive at the Norfolk estate on Christmas Eve, with Prince Philip kicking off festivities when he hosts a drink reception at 7.30pm, pouring the tipples himself.  
Royal expert, Ingrid Seward, revealed that the drinks served by the Duke of Edinburgh are 'very strong'.
She said: 'I think the Queen likes a martini, other people would rather have champagne.
'Prince Philip isn't a great drinker, he always used to drink pale ale.
'So they're not great drinkers. But the drinks are very strong. 
'So any one that's a guest would be knocked out by these drinks.'
After the drinks reception, the family consume a candle-lit six-course meal, with the menu presented in French.
Ingrid added: 'Of course nobody goes to bed before the Queen, and of course when Princess Margaret was alive nobody went to bed before her either. So that meant two or three o'clock in the morning.
'There was  a lot of singing and if someone plays the piano well, like Princess Margaret did, they will be very popular.
The royals also take part in the German tradition of sharing gifts on Christmas Eve, a tradition started by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert. 
But rather than the grand gifts you might expect the royal family gifting each other, they in fact compete to buy one another the tackiest, silliest gifts. 
At 6pm precisely the royals are called into Sandringham's drawing room, where they have a 'holy evening' of gift giving and view the gifts as the 'jokier the better', the documentary revealed.
Over the years, the Queen has received a 'Big Mouth Billie Bass' the comical singing fish that hangs on walls, as well as a washing up apron as gifts from her family. 
One year, Prince Harry gifted his brother William a comb, making light of his hair loss, while The Duchess of Cambridge brought her brother-in-law a 'Grow Your Own Girlfriend' kit, before he met his wife Meghan.
The documentary revealed during her first visit at Sandringham, Princess Diana missed the memo and bought Princess Anne a cashmere jumper, only to receive a toilet roll holder in return.
She quickly learned her lesson though, and the following year purchased a leopard print bath mat for Sarah Ferguson. 
There's no lie in for royals after a late night on Christmas Eve, because they are up early on Christmas Day to attend church, with the eyes of the world on them.
But not before opening a stocking and also enjoying breakfast together, where 'everyone serves themselves'. 
All guests, including the Corgis, receive a stocking in the morning which has gifts and fruit from the Queen inside. 
Royal writer Richard Kay added: 'We all think it's a terribly formal, but really they have a  wonderful relaxed time at Sandringham like the rest of us.
He added the the family regularly play charades and party games.
'The Queen is a very good mimic and did a wonderful Margaret Thatcher impression years ago,' he continued. 
Claudia Joseph, Royal Author added: 'Prince Andrew once said they don't play monopoly as it gets too vicious, as they're all so competitive'.  
After church,  the royals head back to the main house and enjoy a full Christmas dinner with all the trimmings, including mashed potatoes with cream and butter, sauteed parsnips with Parmesan,  carrots, stuffing, gravy and Brussels sprouts served with onion and shredded bacon.
Following dinner, the whole family watches the Queen's Christmas message together.  
Most of the family leave on Boxing Day and make their way to see other parts of their family over the festive period, after taking part in the annual Boxing Day shoot.
The Queen and Prince Philip stay at the Norfolk Estate until early February, to mark the anniversary of George VI's death. 
The Queen's father died on the estate in 1952. 
While a lot of festive fun is had on the estate, the tradition begins before the royals arrive, with Prince Philip decorating the tree and strict pecking order dictating which royals arrive first.
The most junior royals are the first guest, followed by the higher-ranking family members, with Prince Charles and Camilla arriving last. 
While the Queen approves royal decorations at all official residences, Prince Philip will always put the gold star on top of the tree. 
Royal commentator Dickie Arbiter revealed: 'The tree is decorated in much the same way as people throughout the United Kingdom decorate their tree.
'You've got the baubles, the tinsel, the coloured lights.'  
Royal expert, Claudia Joseph, added: 'Prince Philip will always put the gold star on the top of the tree, and probably will continue to do so for the rest of his life.
'He's quite a stalwart and won't let other people take control.
'When any young children come they put their own decorations on.'  
The Queen also makes sure all her staff are looked after, and personally signs a Chrsitmas card to all staff.
Dickie added: 'The Queen signs every Christmas card she sends, as does Prince Philip.
'There's no stencilling or faxing or anything like that, and the card count runs into hundreds.
'All the staff get a card, then friends get a card.
'There are people you've got send cards to and people you want to send cards to, but every card is signed by both of them.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Absolute tragedy' - one women dead and another hospitalised after swimmers got into difficulty off Antrim beach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A WOMAN has died and another is in hospital after a group of swimmers got into difficulty off Ballycastle beach, Co Antrim this morning.
Emergency services were alerted to the incident shortly before 8.30am.
A Coastguard spokesman said it received a call after reports of two women in the water.
"We tasked two RNLI lifeboats, one from Red Bay and one from Portrush and two coastguard rescue teams, one from Ballycastle and one from Coleraine," the spokesman said.
"A Coastguard rescue helicopter was also sent to the scene. As the first team was arriving they reported that the two females were out of the water. The ambulance service was dealing with the casualties so we stood down the two RNLI lifeboats and the Coastguard helicopter."
The spokesman said the woman taken to hospital was being treated for hypothermia.
The Northern Health Trust confirmed that the woman's condition was stable.
Inspector Mick Wood added: "Police received a report from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service shortly after 8.30am for the concern for safety of two female swimmers at Ballycastle beach in the Cushendall Road area.
"Officers attended the scene along with other emergency services colleagues, including the Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service, Air Ambulance NI and The Coastguard.
"Tragically, one of the women passed away at the scene.
"The second female has been taken to hospital where she remains undergoing treatment.
"Our officers remain at the scene as we continue to deal with this tragic incident."
DUP MP Ian Paisley has extended his condolences to those affected by the incident.
He told the Belfast Telegraph: "It is a regular beauty spot for people to go swimming, especially fresh water swimming and you usually find a lot of accomplished swimmers up round there.
"Unfortunately it appears one of these poor people have got into tragic circumstances, maybe caught in a riptide. Another person is in hospital, I understand quite seriously ill with hypothermia. My heart goes out to them and their families...
"It is an absolute tragedy and my sympathies and prayers are with these folk."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wishu, the app that lets businesses book creative freelancers on demand, launches in the UK with €535K raised</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London-based Wishu, the marketplace for creative freelancers, has today announced the launch of its app across the UK. Wishu (founded in 2019) is the world’s first social marketplace app that allows creative freelancers and businesses to negotiate, book and pay for services within the app. Wishu lanches with a total investment of €535K, and a host of major players already on board: Y-Combinator, TechStars, and Momo.
With the rise of freelancing side-hustles, remote teams and co-working offices, it is no surprise that startups like Wishu are popping up to respond to our new ways of working. According to Wishu, there are now 162 million people across Europe and the US freelancing or taking part in the gig economy. Wishu hopes to cater to this trend, as well as suit the communication habits specifically of Generation Z (those born between the mid-1990s to the early 2000s), who will represent 75% of the workforce by 2030. 
Wishu enables creative freelancers in fields such as photography, design, beauty, music, art and dance to spend more time developing creatively, with the app taking care of time-consuming administration and day-to-day practicalities. This is especially important for Generation Z creatives, who are increasingly turning to freelancing as their working mode of choice but find their needs uncatered for in the existing marketplace. The social network aspect of Wishu allows creatives to build a public portfolio, interact with clients, attract requests and bookings, and apply for on-demand jobs posted near them.
On the other side, businesses that want to book local freelancers can do so quickly and easily, by browsing profiles (with user reviews and ID verification), communicating via the chat function, and booking in a single click. They can also post on-demand requests which creative freelancers can apply to. Additionally, Wishu states the cost of hiring talent via the app is lower than through more traditional freelancer agencies.
Moreover, the freelancers themselves are using the app to book other creatives to work with. Wishu has found that early users are likely to book a supporting service through the app, for example a musician booking a photographer for a show, demonstrating a multi-direction marketplace.
Co-founded by three young entrepreneurs – Lavena Xu, CEO, James Johnson, CTO and Hubert Trinkunas, Head of Community – Wishu has also attracted Daniel Evans, formerly Head of Product at fashion social marketplace Depop, to join the team as Head of Product.
Lavena Xu, Co-founder and CEO, said: “The upcoming generation of creatives are increasingly gravitating towards freelancing and a DIY model of building their careers. But they are not receiving the support they need – young creative talents are still spending too much time and energy on the day-to-day tasks of managing their work. Now there is a tool that does the heavy lifting for them in terms of finding work and getting paid.”
“And for those who are booking these freelancers, Wishu offers speed, convenience and security. With all user verification, reviews and payments handled through our system, we give companies and individuals peace of mind,” added Xu.
The Wishu app is available in the App store and is expected to become available on Android in early 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roy Hodgson hails "superb professional" Jairo Riedewald</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Ajax academy graduate was introduced at half-time of the goalless draw with Watford, after makeshift left-back Jeffrey Schlupp suffered a muscle injury.
Before coming on at Vicarage Road, forgotten man Riedewald had not played in a top-flight game since a 3-2 win over Brighton in April 2018.
It has been a frustrating time for the 23-year-old since moving to Selhurst Park in July 2017 for a deal worth a reported £7.9million.
Riedewald, a centre-back by trade, signed for Palace under his old Ajax manager Frank De Boer, but has been given limited opportunities in recent campaigns and only made four appearances last season.
"Of course he has been frustrated, but he's been a superb professional," Hodgson said.
"He comes in all the time, gets on with his work and never ever complains. He doesn't sulk or show he is particularly unhappy, but of course he is frustrated. Anyone would be.
"He was bought by the club – by the previous manager – two-and-a-half years ago and cost a fair amount of money by our standards.
"When you then don't get a chance to play in the position you thought you were coming to play in, because the manager changes and decides he wants other people, it must be frustrating, but I have to take my hat off to him.
"He has not allowed that to show and he is a popular player with the others simply because he gets on with his work in a quiet and meaningful way.
"And when push comes to shove and we've had to ask him to really step up to the plate, he has done so."
Injuries mean Riedewald may now be handed a rare start when Palace entertain Brighton on Monday week, with Patrick Van Aanholt out with a hamstring issue and Schlupp set to join him on the treatment table.
While he would again be out of position at left-back, Riedewald showed at Watford he is capable of performing that role.
"He is an intelligent player, he reads the game very well and uses the quality he has to good effect," Hodgson added.
"On several occasions his composure and calmness on the ball was good and there is no doubt he will relish the opportunity if he continues in that position."

In an interview, Bobby revealed how Venkatesh was fully concerned when he heard the narration of the story for the first time. “Why did you tell less about Chaitanya?” he asked Bobby. The script was still in the development stage, then.
The senior star wanted more for his nephew and asked the same, to give something that gives memorable moments for Chaitanya and the audiences. According to Bobby, there were scenes where Chay has to perform while seniors like Venkatesh and Prakash Raj have to lie low.
Venkatesh was very supportive when such scenes were shot, and he was constantly discussing with Chay and encouraging his nephew.
Recently, Chay watched the full movie and was so impressed with it that he hugged his director and thanked him for making such a good film. Well, audiences are also awaiting to see the real-life uncle-nephew combo to create magic on the screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lori Harvey Knows Better Than Her Mom, Marjorie Harvey, According To This Video; And Future, Diddy, And Trey Songz Are Happy About That</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An old video clip showing Lori Harvey, the daughter of Marjorie and Steve Harvey, talking to her mother, regained popularity after some events in her wild love life took place over this year.
In the clip, dating from 2015, when Lori was just an 18-year-old college student, she had a discussion with Marjorie about how to behave appropriately once she was on her own and not living with her parents anymore.
Marjorie started her motherly pieces of advice by bringing up the topic of dating.
The concerned parent asked her daughter jokingly how they were going to handle the fact that she started dating earlier and continued by stating that she was not allowed to be involved with athletes, rappers, and men with similar professions.
It seems that even at such a young age, Lori had a clear opinion of how she was handling her romances as she commented that her mother had nothing to worry about when it comes to dating because she was sure she would make the right choices.
In the footage, Marjorie also gave her daughter the advice to never try to fit in, when God has created her to stand out and urged her to always behave like a lady.
Marjorie said: “I know you just started dating this year, so how are we going to handle that? No athletes, no rappers, we gon go down the list.”
She added: “Don’t ever try to fit in when God has clearly created you to stand out. Always be a lady, and always understand you are the prize. Don’t give yourself to anybody that is not going to be your husband. If they love you, if they really care about you, they’ll wait on it.”
Lori responded by: “When it comes to dating, my mom has nothing to worry about. I got this.”
However, it appears that the rule of dating no rappers does mot hold anymore since Lori has been rumored to be involved with a couple of rap performers in the past year.
Besides allegedly dating Sean “Diddy” Combs, Lori was also said to have been seeing Trey Songz and Future.
The young social media personality is one of the most sought-after dates in the entertainment industry.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Telangana HC orders bodies of Hyderabad accused to be preserved till December 13</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Telangana High Court on Monday ordered to preserve the bodies of the accused in the Telangana doctor's rape and murder case till December 13. The matter has been posted for hearing on December 12.
The alleged rapists were shot down by the Cyberabad police on Friday after they tried to run away during the recreation of crime scene. The police claimed that the accused had snatched their weapons and fired at them, following which the police fired in retaliation, leading to their death.
The Telangana government has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the killing of four accused in the rape and murder of a woman veterinarian in "retaliatory" firing by police last week.
A Government Order was issued in this regard on Sunday.
"The cause and circumstances leading to the death of the four persons should be ascertained with reasons and establish truth and in view of the fact that the case requires sustained and focused investigation, a SIT is constituted to investigate the case," the Order said.
The eight-member SIT led by Rachakonda Police Commissioner Mahesh M Bhagwat, should immediately take over investigation in the case registered over the "exchange of fire" and all other related cases registered in the state as per Supreme Court guidelines, it said.
The SIT should complete the investigation and submit the report before a competent court of law, it said.
The four were arrested on November 29 for allegedly raping and killing the woman by smothering her and later burning the body.
A petition has also been moved in the Supreme Court questioning the legality of the Hyderabad encounter.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SoftBank and The University of Tokyo teamed on a project to boost development of AI in Japan, establishing a research institute in the nation’s capital city to study the impact of the technology on industry and society.
Under a partnership agreement, the pair will establish the Beyond AI Institute. In a statement, SoftBank explained this would bring “top-level researchers from the University of Tokyo and leading universities abroad” together, to “conduct fundamental research for key AI technology” while also tapping relevant research from other academic fields.
The institute will predominantly focus on areas including healthcare, manufacturing, and public works and social infrastructure.
SoftBank stated the partnership was made possible by a Japanese initiative designed to accelerate collaborations between academia and businesses: “Using this system will create an ecosystem where it will be possible to quickly envision commercialisation through joint ventures at the research stage and invest returns from business ventures into future research activities”.
The conglomerate explained the collaboration would contribute to research which would “lead Japan’s AI revolution”.
Fundamental research will be undertaken in the university’s Hongo Campus, while the facility for applied research will be established at the future SoftBank headquarters in Takeshiba, expected to open during the fiscal year ending 31 March 2021.
To set up the AI research institute, SoftBank will spend JPY20 billion ($184 million) over ten years, South China Morning Post reported.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Slowdown only cyclical, India's growth potential not lost: Chief Economic Advisor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The economic slowdown which India is facing at present is only cyclical in nature, and the country has not lost its growth potential, which signifies that the economy will bounce back, Chief Economic Advisor K Subramanian said.
Subramanian said that there was, needless to say, a slowdown in the economy but it needs to be assessed whether it was structural or cyclical in nature.
India’s GDP growth in Q1 of the current financial year, fell to a 6-year low of 5%, while Q2 slowed down further to 4.5%.
The Reserve Bank of India has also lowered its GDP forecast for 2019-20 from 6.1% to 5%.
“My take is that this is a lot more on the cyclical side, because there has been no change in the demographics, there has been no change in the demand in the medium term and the ability of companies to supply,” he said at the FICCI young leaders summit here on Monday.
“and if anything, we are now doing a lot of reforms, and reforms enhance the productivity of the economy,” he added.
He said that the potential growth rate of the country was unaltered, the reason why the economy will come back on track, he said, without indicating a time period, however.
“As we showed clearly in the economic survey that for an economy like India, it is actually investment, especially private investment that is the key driver of economic growth,” he said.
He said that there was a well thought-out agenda behind implementation of the reforms that the government was introducing.
“So the steps we are taking, be it the corporate tax rate cut, the code on wages and industrial relations, is trying to create a more favourable environment for investment, which is what we require for sustained growth,” he said.
“The laws of economics are quite strong and what basically takes us down, also brings us up,” he added.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in November this year said that while the growth rate had come down, there was no fear of recession.
Sitharaman had in September announced corporate tax rate cut from an effective 35% (including surcharges and cesses) to an effective 25.17% while the rate for new manufacturing companies reduced to 15% from 25%.
The CEA also said that the government was not complacent of what was needed to be done, continuous stakeholder discussions are being held to see what recuperative measures could be further taken.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mikel Arteta 'first choice for Arsenal job'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since the Gunners made the decision to part ways with the Spaniard last month, Freddie Ljungberg has taken over on an interim basis.
However, with the North London side having picked up just one point from Premier League fixtures against Norwich City and Brighton & Hove Albion respectively, the club's board has stepped up their efforts to bring in a long-term replacement.
According to The Express, Arsenal have now settled on Arteta as their first choice, despite the fact that the Spaniard missed out on the role just 18 months ago.
The report suggests that Arsenal now face a battle to tempt their former player into leaving his position at the Etihad Stadium midway through the campaign.
Pep Guardiola has recently insisted that Arteta will at least see out the season in the North-West.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Electricity vandals throw nine Anambra communities into darkness</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Enugu Electricity Distribution (EEDC) on Monday said that about nine communities were affected by the power outage resulting from vandalism of Enugwu-Ukwu 33KV line.
Mr Emeka Ezeh, Head of EEDC Communications Department, made this known in a statement made available to newsmen in Awka.
Ezeh said the vandalism on its installation was carried out early Sunday.
He said that valuable equipment were carted away from the line which transmits to Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo and Nimo 11KV feeders.
He said the communities affected were, Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo, Nimo, Nawfia, Umuokpu, Abba, Ifitedunu and parts of Amawbia, left without electricity supply.
According to him, EEDC regrets to inform her esteemed customers under Enugwu-Ukwu 33KV line that the current loss of supply being experienced is as a result of the vandalism of the 33KV network feeding them.
“This network radiates from Agu Awka Transmission Substation, Awka, Anambra.
“Materials carted away include five spans of aluminium conductors, all-fibre cross-arms and 33KV pot insulators and also a broken high tension pole.
“Consequently, our customers in the entire Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo, Nimo, Nawfia, Umuokpu, Abba, Ifitedunu and parts of Amawbia are without electricity supply,” he said.
Ezeh said that efforts were on to fix the problem and restore power supply.
He urged customers of EEDC to see protection of its installations as a shared responsibility.
“Plans are on to address this challenge and we assure our customers that supply will be restored as soon as repairs and replacement are completed.
“EEDC remains committed to providing her esteemed customers with improved service delivery while soliciting for their continued support in ensuring that such an incident does not occur in the network,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I-League: Real Kashmir FC's two home games postponed after closure of Srinagar airport</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Real Kashmir FC’s two upcoming home I-League matches were on Monday postponed owing to inclement weather which has forced closure of the Srinagar airport, the All India Football Federation said on Monday.
Flight operations at Srinagar airport have been disrupted since Sunday due to dense fog.
“With the Srinagar Airport not being operational due to poor weather conditions, Real Kashmir Football Club’s first two home matches against Gokulam Kerala FC on December 12, 2019, and Churchill Brothers FC Goa on December 15, 2019, stands postponed,” the AIFF said in a press release.
No flight operations took place on Monday morning because of poor visibility. Primary schools were also closed due to adverse weather conditions as heavy fog engulfed most parts of the valley.
“New dates for the matches will be announced soon,” the AIFF added.
Real Kashmir FC, which finished third in its debut season last year, had opened its campaign with a 1-1 draw against East Bengal at Kalyani, West Bengal, on December 4.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cherry blossoms prompt full-blown scandal for Japan's PM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tokyo,  It might be the most Japanese of political scandals: a furore over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's guest list at a party to mark the annual cherry blossom season.
As scandals go, it has plenty of juicy elements -- alleged mafia guests, disappearing evidence, even gaffes by Abe, who appeared to lay blame for shredded documents on a disabled worker.
It's the latest headache for Japan's longest-serving premier, who has already weathered two cronyism scandals in recent years and has faced an almost daily drubbing by opposition lawmakers since the scandal emerged in early November.
The outcry involves a tradition that dates back to 1952 -- a publicly funded cherry blossom party intended to honour the great and the good for their achievements.
The seemingly innocuous gathering become a lightning rod for criticism after claims Abe stacked the guest list with some 850 supporters from his local constituency -- with the party costing 55 million yen ($504,000) in public money.
When the opposition smelled blood, additional allegations piled in: the chairman of a disgraced company was once a guest, a member of one of Japan's infamous yakuza mafia attended in 2019.
The opposition bloc demanded the guest list for this year's event be produced, only to be told it had been shredded on the very same day the request was made.
Just a coincidence, Abe insisted to outraged opposition lawmakers: the documents were shredded during "the work hours of a part-time employee with disabilities," he added, in remarks that many saw as an attempt to blame the worker.
'Abe can hold on'
The scandal has seen public support for Abe's government drop six or seven points to around 50 percent or lower, but experts said Abe is likely to weather the storm.
"Voters are not convinced by the Abe administration's explanation of the scandal," Junichi Saito, a professor of politics at Tokyo's Waseda University, told AFP.
"But opinion polls will not likely fall by more than 10 percentage points because there is no other candidate for a prime minister."
Abe benefits from lingering disillusionment with the country's opposition, with voters still leery after the disastrous performance of the centre-left Democratic Party-led government in 2009-2012.
"I'm sceptical at this point that the opposition will win public support if it manages to dent Abe's with this scandal," Tobias Harris, senior vice president of consulting firm Teneo, told AFP.
"The worst case scenario for Abe is that (his ruling party) LDP supporters abandon him, which hasn't happened thus far, giving him a floor of around thirty percent (support)," he added.
"But even then, without a smoking gun I think Abe can hold on for a long time."
'Better than lying'
Allegations have continued to emerge, including claims that Abe invited supporters to a dinner at a luxury hotel and let his political support group pick up part of the tab in violation of election law.
His government denies that, and a criminal investigation is viewed as extremely unlikely.
Still, Saito said, the allegations risk damaging public faith in the political system.
"This administration is trying to avert criticism" by withholding documents, and that "hurts a system (of accountability) that is necessary for democracy".
Next year's cherry blossom party has been cancelled, with Abe promising to "reflect on" how the gathering has been organised.
That is likely to be enough to tide him over, Junichi Takase, professor of politics at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies, told AFP.
"The opposition bloc has nothing else in their arsenal except attacking Mr Abe for this kind of scandal," he said.
"Mr Abe is good at handling crises. He admitted there was something wrong, apologised, and wants to move on -- that's better than lying."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antonio Valencia tells Manchester United what to do with Paul Pogba</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United captain Antonio Valencia believes Paul Pogba needs love in order to shine at the club.
The midfielder has not played for the club since the draw against Arsenal in September due to an ankle injury and there was speculation the France international was delaying his return ahead of a possible January transfer.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shut down those reports and Valencia has explained what he thinks United need to do to get the best out of the 26-year-old on his playing return in the coming weeks.
"Pogba is a star, I've known him since he was 14-years-old. Do you know what you need? Love," he told Mundo Deportivo. "I have heard many rumors about Zidane and Real Madrid but he never said anything. He is reserved and an intelligent guy. If in United they give him that love, Pogba will shine as before."
United put in their best two performances of the season this week with wins against Tottenham and Manchester City and Valencia believes the club need to be patient with Solskjaer and more positive results will come.
"This season you have to make up the team, play well and understand each other," Valencia said. "And next year, it is important to enter the Champions League. Patience, the results will come."
Despite the form of Scott McTominay and Fred, Solskjaer intends to accommodate World Cup Pogba winner in any side he picks. "Of course, Paul's going to play when he gets his fitness," Solskjaer said. "He's one of the best players in the world when he's in form.
"We just need to give him time to be 100 per cent fit. It might be 45 minutes, the first game. It might be half-an-hour, it might be 90. It depends on what game he comes back in and I'm looking to get Paul back to where I had him a year ago."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trump warns Kim has 'everything' to lose through hostility</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump warned Sunday that North Korea's Kim Jong Un had "everything" to lose through hostility towards the United States, after Pyongyang said it had carried out a major new weapons test."Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way," Trump tweeted in response to the unspecified test at the Sohae space launch center.The announcement of Saturday's test came just hours after Trump said he would be "surprised" by any hostile action from the North, emphasizing his "very good relationship" with Kim.Trump and Kim engaged in months of mutual insults and threats of devastation in 2017, sending tensions soaring before a diplomatic rapprochement the following year.The pair have met three times since June 2018 but with little progress towards denuclearization. Pyongyang has set Washington a December 31 deadline to make new concessions to kickstart stalled talks."North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearize as promised," Trump tweeted."NATO, China, Russia, Japan, and the entire world is unified on this issue!"Writing that Kim had "signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement" at their June 2018 summit in Singapore," Trump warned: "He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November."Separately, interviewed on the CBS TV news program "Face the Nation," US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien was asked whether North Korea was preparing to restart nuclear tests."I hope not. That would be a mistake on the part of North Korea," O'Brien said."Kim Jong Un promised to denuclearize North Korea," O'Brien said. "And we expect him to live up to the promise he made at the summit in Singapore. And we hope he'll do so."On Saturday, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in spoke by phone with Trump and agreed to maintain dialogue with Pyongyang.The 30-minute talk was the first conversation between Trump and the South Korean leader since they met at the UN General Assembly in New York in September."The two leaders shared an assessment that the current situation on the Korean peninsula is grave," said South Korean presidential spokeswoman Ko Min-jung, adding that Trump had requested the call.A spokesman for North Korea's Academy of National Defense Science said Saturday's "very important test" would have an "important effect" on changing the "strategic position" of North Korea, in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. -AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Karnataka bypolls will give battered BJP some confidence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With three more phases of Jharkhand Assembly election remaining to go, the BJP has received a boost in down south Karnataka, where its government was hanging by a thread tied to the by-elections held at 15 seats.
The BJP won 12 of the 15 seats where bypolls were held on December 5. The future of BS Yeddyurappa government of Karnataka depended on the outcome of the bypolls, which were necessitated by the disqualification of 17 MLAs of the Congress and the JDS earlier this year when the BJP returned to power in the middle of the allegations of horse-trading and defection-engineering.
With the election of 15 new members, the strength of Karnataka Assembly has gone up to 223. The normal strength of the house is 225. The truncated Karnataka Assembly had a strength of 208 making the BJP enjoying majority with 105 MLAs.
In the full-strength Karnataka Assembly, the ruling party requires support of 123 MLAs. Two seats still remain vacant. This means, the BJP requires support of 112 MLAs to keep Yeddyurappa secure. The BJP's own number has increased to 117 with the sweep in Karnataka bypolls.
This result is bound to give the BJP some confidence in Maharashtra, where it just lost power to ally-turned-rival Shiv Sena, Goa - where the Shiv Sena is said to be trying to unite anit-BJP leaders - and Jharkhand, where the BJP shed its long-standing allies in the ongoing election.
The BJP was looking battered after it failed to read unexpectedly stiff resistance from its oldest ally Shiv Sena which - the BJP feels rode on its back to emerge second-largest party in Maharashtra election - formed government in alliance with the NCP and the Congress. The BJP is the single-largest party and was outwitted not only by the Shiv Sena but also by NCP leader Ajit Pawar last month.
The Shiv Sena then claimed that Maharashtra experiment would be repeated in Goa, where the BJP is the single-largest party with 17 seats in the 40-member assembly. It is supported by the Goa Forward Party (3 MLAs), Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party (1 MLA) and three Independent MLAs. The BJP has spent much of its energy in keeping its alliance together since Shiv Sena's threat in Goa.
In Jharkhand, the BJP - smarting under the Shiv Sena shocker in Maharashtra - decided to go solo. This is the first time that the BJP is contesting an assembly election without its ally All Jharkhand Students Union since the state came into being in 2000.
The BJP cadre were reported to have been demotivated sensing that the once-again-emerging unity of the Opposition was gaining traction on the ground. The party had failed to secure majority in Haryana - where election was held along with Maharashtra - and was forced to show magnanimity in sharing power with fledgling Loknayak Janata Party of Dushyant Chautala.
The apparent reverses faced by the BJP in Haryana and Maharashtra -- with the Opposition claiming moral victory in one state and turning the saffron victory into an embarrassment in the other - have been neutralised for the BJP with clean sweep in Karnataka bypolls.
This was seen in the statements of Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar, who "accepted defeat" and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said, "Karnataka results show that in any state, if someone goes against the mandate of the people, they will be punished by the people."
This is a clear jibe at the Shiv Sena by PM Modi. But at the same time, it appears to be a message from PM Modi, in the wake of the Shiv Sena's Maharashtra machinations, to the allies of the BJP in states where elections are due next year. Bihar and Delhi will go to polls next year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HELSINKI: Finland's Social Democratic Party (SDP), one of the five parties set to form the coalition government, has picked 34-year-old Sanna Marin to be the country's youngest Prime Minister.
Marin, who is currently the Finnish Minister of Transport and Communications, narrowly won over Antti Lindtman, the 37-year-old chairman of the Social Democratic Parliamentary Group, in a vote of 32-29, Xinhua news agency reported.
The vote was carried out at the Social Democratic Party Council on Sunday evening. The results of the vote were announced in a nationally-televised broadcast.
The position of the prime minister became vacant as the cabinet under former Prime Minister Antti Rinne had to resign following the loss of confidence in him of one of the coalition partners, the Centre Party.
The previous coalition composition will continue. The five parties met on Sunday afternoon and pledged adherence to the program of the outgoing cabinet. The coalition comprises the Social Democrats, the Centre, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party.
Following her victory, Marin gave a brief statement calling for party unity. Procedural formalities of the government change will continue on Monday. Local media said President Sauli Niinisto is likely to appoint the new government on Tuesday.
Marin has been Finland's Minister of Transport and Communications since June of 2019. She is also SDP deputy chair, who led the party during Rinne's extended sick leave last winter. Marin is also a member of parliament.
She became nationally known first in the municipal political scene in Tampere, the second largest town in Finland. She was the chairperson of the City Council of Tampere from 2013 to 2017.
Marin has a master's degree in Administrative Sciences in Tampere University.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An earthquake of magnitude 3.1 on the Richter scale was felt at dawn on Faial Island on 9 December, in an area that since the beginning of November has seen an increase in seismic activity.
According to the Azores Seismovulcanic Surveillance and Information Centre (CIVISA), at 3.15am (Lisbon time) an earthquake of magnitude 3.1 (Richter) and the epicentre were recorded about 32 kilometres west of Capelo, Faial Island.
According to available information, the earthquake was felt with maximum intensity III (Modified Mercalli Scale) in Capelo parish (Horta municipality, Faial island).
CIVISA says it continues to monitor developments and will issue further announcements if necessary.
This was at least the third earthquake felt in the same zone in two days. On Saturday, 7 December, two aftershocks were recorded on the Azorean island of Faial, one at dawn (3.2 on the Richter scale) and another in the afternoon (3.5).
Since 3 November, the west of Faial has been experiencing an increase in seismic activity.
Earthquakes are classified according to their magnitude as micro (less than 2.0), very small (2.0-2.9), small (3.0-3.9), slight (4.0-4.9), moderate (5.0-5.9), strong (6.0-6.9), large (7.0-7.9), important (8.0-8.9), exceptional (9, 0-9,9) and extreme (greater than 10).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will govt seek a middle path via an independent review panel?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six months after the launch of the extradition bill-related protest movement, Hong Kong continues to grapple with large-scale street demonstrations and elevated public anger toward the establishment.
Although there have been mounting calls within society for an independent commission of inquiry (COI) into all the recent events, the government has continued to dig in its heels and is rejecting such demands.
Instead, all it is willing to do is to establish an independent review committee (IRC), which can look at the causes of the current social unrest, identify the underlying social, economic or political problems, and recommend measures that the administration should take, but which has no power to investigate or subpoena witnesses to testify before it.
As the proposed IRC is seen as no more than a “paper tiger”, it has fueled skepticism as to whether the government is truly sincere in trying to resolve the ongoing crisis.
Amid this situation, we now hear talk that the administration is taking a serious look at launching an IRC, and that it is deeply convinced that such move can help end the violence and chaos in society.
It is said that recently Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had personally asked Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong to put together a core working team that will look for the right candidates to sit on the IRC, and that we can expect major progress in the short run.
The idea of setting up an IRC was first put forward by Lam herself back in September when she announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.
Nevertheless, more than two months on, the administration is yet to make any solid announcement about the plan.
Meanwhile, there is chatter in the legal sector that the government did actually approach some retired judges to test the waters and inquire if they would be willing to head the IRC.
According to the analysis of a figure in the legal sector, the retired judges said ‘no’ as they didn’t want to be at the helm of a “toothless tiger”. 
It is understood that since no retired judge is willing to take up the task, some have suggested that the government should invite an academic with social status to lead the IRC.
However, it is said that the administration is still insisting on appointing a judge to chair the committee, mainly because of the impartial public image of judges, which, the authorities hope, can make the findings of the review more acceptable among society.
It is also said that in order to step up efforts at finding a prominent legal figure to lead the IRC, the chief executive has recently required Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee, the current head of the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office, to join forces with Law to form a core team to work on it.
In the meantime, Henry Fan Hung-ling, the newly appointed chairman of the Hospital Authority (HA), has outlined another suggestion last week.
Last Thursday, Fan publicly called upon the government to set up an IRC under the existing Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance, so that the committee can be vested with statutory power to summon witnesses.
Fan stressed that the IRC he proposed wasn’t intended to hold anybody accountable, but rather, to get to the root of the problem, such as finding out whether or not something has gone wrong with the police deployment.
Apparently, what Fan was trying to do is here to steer a middle course between the uncompromising stance of the government and the demands of protesters. And his proposal might at least be able to offer us some light at the end of the tunnel.
Unfortunately, as we have just learned, Fan’s suggestion hasn’t gained much favor with the government leadership.
The is largely because what he is proposing is seen by the administration as tantamount to having a “de facto COI” in the guise of an IRC, an idea that will deeply upset both the central authorities and the police.

    <h5 class="mb-1">French-listed behemoth Elis weighs bid for Spotless Laundries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's a French behemoth weighing a bid for Spotless' up-for-sale commercial laundries business.
Street Talk understands the €4.1 billion, Euronext-listed Elis has been mulling making a play for the division, with the second round of the auction to get underway on Australia Day.
Spotless – controlled by Downer Group – mandated Sydney-based corporate VCA Partners earlier this year to run an auction for the laundries business, which was spruiked as Australia's No.1 player in linen.
It's fair to say VCA Partners isn't in any great rush to hurry the sales process along, especially with two weeks until Christmas. In fact, sources reckon slowing things down will allow trade interest to build and give the buyout firms a run for their money.
From where Street Talk sits, VCA would want the likes of Phil Cave's Anchorage Capital Partners – who bought commercial laundry and dry-cleaning business South Pacific Laundry in late 2018 – to take a look under the hood.
Potential bidder Elis has a long-standing working relationship with Deutsche Bank. The investment bank advised it during its £2.2 billion takeover of British textile maintenance service provider Berendsen in 2017.
So if Elis were to lob a bid, it'd be a safe bet that Deutsche would be on the ticket.
Elis generated €3.1 billion in revenue in 2018 and €985.6 million in earnings. The company operates in 28 countries, across 440 plants with almost 50,000 employees.
Spotless Laundries meanwhile has 13 plants around Australia that are supported by a fleet of 275 delivery vehicles and five depots, according to its sale flyer sent out in October.
In that flyer, interested parties were told Spotless Laundries was expected to record $265.3 million in revenue and $59.1 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the 2020 financial year.
Prior to tapping VCA Partners, Street Talk revealed Spotless had hired PwC to run vendor due diligence on the unit ahead of a potential sale.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Swiss healthcare costs have 'doubled' since 2000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Recently released figures show that health insurance premiums have doubled in the past 20 years, with some Swiss households spending almost one fifth of their salary on healthcare.
Figures from the Swiss Trade Union show that costs have increased by 120 percent on average since the year 2000. 
The increases are much higher than wages, while other cost-mitigating changes like rebates for people on lower incomes have also failed to keep up with rising premiums.

Couples with household salaries between 60,000 and 90,000 francs spend on average 14 percent of their salaries on healthcare. 
In some of the more expensive cantons such as Bern and Zurich, the amount can be higher than 20 percent. 
While lower income Swiss will be eligible for reductions and rebates, middle-income Swiss are often hit the hardest by increases in healthcare costs. 
More going into debt to pay for healthcare
The impact of the cost increases can be seen in relation to household debt for healthcare. 
At the turn of the millennium, just over a third (36 percent) of households in Switzerland had healthcare debts higher than 5000 francs. 
At the present time, 59 percent of households had accrued debts of over 10,000 francs for healthcare costs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hotels and restaurants in East of England 'at heightened risk of insolvency'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The East of England's agricultural sector is healthier than most other parts of the UK - but construction, hotel and restaurant businesses are at heightened risk, a report suggests.
A study by insolvency and restructuring specialists R3 Eastern shows that farming is outperforming its regional counterparts with one of the lowest levels of elevated insolvency risk in the UK.
But other business sectors in the region are struggling, figures compiled by R3 for November suggests.
MORE - Farming has 'great future' - but it must change, says new farm co-op chairThe trade body, which used Bureau Van Dijk's Fame database, found around one in three agricultural businesses - or 32.9% - are at higher than normal risk of insolvency - one of the lowest statistics for the sector in the UK. Only London and the north east have lower percentages.
Wales has the highest percentage at 45.3% - more than nine points above the UK average of 36.2%.
Other sectors in the East of England are faring less well, figures suggest.
Construction has the third highest proportion of businesses at above average risk across the UK regions with almost half - 45.6% - about 2% above the UK average of 43.7%. Only the south east and south west have a higher percentage of construction businesses at elevated risk of insolvency, with levels of 47.2% and 47.8% respectively.
The research also showed 37.4% of hotel companies in the region judged to be at elevated insolvency risk in November - more than 5% above the UK-wide figure of 32%. The picture is similar for the region's restaurant operators, with 35.2% at heightened risk of insolvency compared to the UK average of 32.9%, a gap of more than 2%.
R3 Eastern chair Mark Upton, a partner at Ensors Chartered Accountants in East Anglia, said: "It is encouraging to see local agricultural businesses outperforming their national competition but the regional picture overall is no cause for celebration. We have to be realistic that the East of England, and the UK as a whole, continues to face some strong economic challenges.
"Uncertainty and stop-start stockpiling are among the factors hitting local investment and wider business health, and members of the insolvency and restructuring profession report anecdotally that they are seeing increasing numbers of companies worrying about their cashflow levels and order books."

    <h5 class="mb-1">$251m equity raising a bridge too FAR?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Blue sky Senegalese oil play FAR Ltd has told shareholders all about a planned $US350 million-odd debt raising – but what about its equally if not more ambitious equity offer?
Street Talk can reveal FAR has spent the past week pitching a $251 million equity raising to fund managers, which was to be done via a placement of new shares and help fund its aim to be one of the biggest ASX-listed oil producers.
It is understood FAR and its brokers started crossing fund managers early last week – and judging by the fact it is yet to hit the tape, we can only assume it hasn’t had as strong a reception as the explorer was hoping for.
The mooted deal was slated as a $251 million placement underwritten by Macquarie Capital and Bell Potter, according to a presentation sent to wall-crossed investors and seen by Street Talk, although fundies reckon Macquarie has either dropped off or was never there and FAR was now talking about a non-underwritten deal via Bell Potter.
The proposed placement was subject to FAR receiving binding and committed terms for a senior debt facility – arranged by Macquarie as announced last month but now said to include “several leading financial institutions” - by December 31.
The twin debt and equity raisings would see FAR secure $US520 million ($768 million). Proceeds are earmarked primarily to develop the Sangomar field – a $US4.2 billion ($6.2 billion) oil project in Senegal in which it was controversially joined by Woodside Petroleum in 2016 – with the cost to FAR put at $US492 million ($727 million) to reach start-up, the presentation said.
FAR was originally targeting project financing for the venture, but those plans were derailed by the ongoing arbitration it initiated over Woodside's buyout of ConocoPhillips's stake in the project, then known as SNE.
But with Woodside sticking to a final investment decision by the year-end, for production to start "by early 2023", FAR does not have time on its side.
The placement was to have been followed by a non-underwritten share purchase plan to raise up to another $30 million.
It’s a tall ask for the Africa-focused oil and gas explorer, which has a $340 million market capitalisation and a number of sceptics in the institutional investment community.
As of after-market on Monday, the latest iteration of the deal, or "plan D" was $100 million in new equity and $150 million in mezzanine debt. Cornerstone investors were being sought, sources told this column.
It is not known at what price FAR was aiming to secure the equity injection. The prolonged sounding process is no doubt trying to determine what price – if any – fund managers would be willing to back the blue sky story.
It comes after Woodside and its partners in Sangomar – which include Cairn Energy and Senegal's Petrosen – took a significant step towards committing to construction last week, submitting a development plan to the government just before their licence expired.
FAR’s shares closed at 5.4¢ on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Samsung TV costs Rs 12 crore. Here's why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tech conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co. has created some ripples in the tech industry with the launch of a series of LED TVs titled 'The Wall'.
Now, what is special about 'The Wall'?
Dubbed India's most expensive TV to date, 'The Wall' series starts from Rs 3.5 crore and goes all the way up to a whopping Rs 12 crore. Excluding taxes. Available in three models, 146 inches (4k resolution), 219 inches (6k resolution) and 292 inches (8k resolution), the modular Micro LED display was first unveiled at the CES 2019 event in Las Vegas earlier this year.
The first in its league, no other TV in India comes close enough to stand up to 'The Wall' when it comes to the price point.
Aptly named 'The Wall,' the TV comprises six-by-six inch LED panels that make up the screen. 
The Wall Luxury and The Wall Pro
Samsung plans to roll out two versions of the TV - The Wall Luxury and The Wall Pro. While the former would cater to home cinema and gaming experiences with the features of a smart TV, the latter would be a customisable option for business, corporate and retail environments, said MoneyControl.    
The TV, which was also the 2019 CES Best of Innovation Award winner, finally made landfall in the country early December and is available exclusively at the  Samsung Executive Briefing Centre in Gurgaon, as per a Firstpost report.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Capable of hitting six on any ground: Shivam Dube</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shivam Dube is confident that he can "clear any ground" in the world after providing a demo of his six-hitting prowess against the West Indies in the second T20 International, albeit in a losing cause.
Promoted up the order at No 3, Dube smashed 54 off 30 balls with four sixes, three of which came in one over from rival skipper Kieron Pollard but India failed to defend a target of 170 with three-match series levelled at 1-1.
"I think this ground is big but I have the capability of clearing any ground. You might have seen today also and that’s the capability I have," the big-bodied Dube said at the post-match press conference.
Initially, Dube was unable to clear the ropes as he relied more on power than timing which didn't work for him. However the Mumbai player believes that power will always remain his USP.
"I think that's my strength and I always go like that only," he added. When he was struggling with his timing, it was vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who urged the youngster to stay calm and back his strength, which was exactly the advice that he needed at that juncture.
"I think I was given the opportunity to bat at No.3 and I think it was a big deal for me. The pressure was there at the starting obviously - international match.
"After that, Rohit bhai helped me and he said 'stay calm and back your strength'. I think that was the motivation I needed from a senior player. Then, I got one six and did really well after that," he added. Dube said that dropped catches are a part and parcel of this game and this was a one-off.
"Yes, we dropped catches and it was unfortunate. Had we held onto them, that would have changed everything. But then any team can drop catches – it doesn't matter. I think we are the best team. We had a tough match today, but we will come back next match," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reader’s comment: Pakistan’s movement to revive Punjabi culture faces no viable threat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This letter is a response to Prateek Joshi’s piece, which was published on December 4 (Pakistan’s bid to use Punjabi culture to deepen fault lines in India will only fan tensions at home). I have been closely affiliated with the movement for the revival of Punjabi language, culture, and identity – which we also call ‘Punjabiyat’, the term embracing shared geography, language, heritage, history and culture across religions in Pakistani Punjab – for the last three years.
This article is based on assumptions and sensational claims. It makes a complete hotchpotch of these very different terms to further a false claim. Neither the opening of Sikh holy places like Kartarpur for international pilgrims nor the promotion of Punjabiyat, Punjabi and Punjabi culture are currently fanning any “tensions” within Pakistan.The pilgrimage is being used to generate revenue and improve Pakistan’s image abroad, and the movement for Punjabiyat is still too young to pose a formidable threat to Pakistani state narrative or actors.
The article makes the following statement: “But for Pakistan, the policy of using Punjabi culture as a strategic tool has alienated conservative groups at home.” Which “conservative” groups precisely? How have they been “alienated” and where is the evidence? Are we forgetting the famed “mullah-military” complex and the assertion that Pakistan’s religious elite is usually in bed with its establishment? There is little doubt that the history of combined Punjab and its three main communities – Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs – is deeply troubled and discomforting. But the symbolic breakthroughs made by Pakistan recently are far from causing any major resistance or receiving any noticeable threats because they have a very powerful backing.
The opening paragraph uses a video of young students struggling with Punjabi and makes a passing comment on the Punjabi’s troubles. Firstly, the receding cover of Punjabi in Pakistan is not just because of the state’s preference for Urdu but also Punjab’s colonial legacy, its bloody partition and lack of education at large.
Secondly, the movement for Punjabi revivalism is local, indigenous and revolves around the promotion of its language and culture. The state is not supporting this movement and the regular Punjabi activist has no business with “deepening faultlines in India.” We are trying to save the culture and language of our ancestors from extinction.
The Pakistani establishment is indeed riding high on the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. One can indeed interpret it as an attempt to forward some of its old strategic objectives on Pakistan’s eastern border. But opening this corridor or planting Ranjit Singh’s statue in Lahore’s Shahi Qila is not the equivalent of promoting Punjabi culture or Punjabi identity, which we also call Punjabiyat, or Sikhism by any stretch of the imagination. Punjabi culture, as well as Punjabiyat, are much older and larger concepts that Sikhism is a part of. Please don’t swap these terms with each other. Again, even endorsing Sikhism or discussing the former Sikh empire is not the same as promoting Punjabiyat or Punjabi culture. This shows the author’s sheer lack of understanding – misintention perhaps – of both Indian and Pakistani Punjab.
The author quotes Dr Ali Usman Qasmi, one of leading voices favouring Punjabi in Pakistani academia and an organiser of the pioneering Punjabi conference in Lahore University of Management Sciences: “An Islam-based identity with Urdu as its flagship has made such massive inroads that the successive generation of Punjabi activists has found it difficult to counter it”.
I disagree with this statement by Dr Qasmi. This is not the front we need to fight on. Although a majority of the clerics have a strong command on Urdu, if you go to inner-city Lahore or the famed shrine of Hazrat Ali Hajveri in the heart of the city – Punjabi is used to preach, sing praises of the holy Prophet and even written material is made available. Countering Urdu is not the issue here, countering extremist mindset in Pakistan is the real challenge. So far, no extremist religious group has issued threats to Punjabi activists or organisations.
The main resistance in the adoption Punjabi as a lingua franca in Punjab has come from Punjabis themselves who rightly believe that investing time and money on Punjabi will not pay off. Unlike Urdu and English, only a handful of universities have Punjabi departments and since Punjabi is not taught at the school level, there are few other jobs that utilise this linguistic prowess. The official languages are Urdu and English, and they are rigorously taught. Language activists often argue that if Punjabi and classical poets of Punjabi like Bulleh Shah, Mian Muhammad Baksh, and others were taught as part of the curriculum, their enlightened thoughts will counter the prevalent religious intolerance in Pakistan.
Lastly, a reason for this lack of threat to the movement for Punjabi is that the movement has been slow to catch up. However, one must state here that significant progress has been made. Since 2010, Punjabi language activists have been protesting on Mother Language Day and demanding that, like the other three provinces in Pakistan, primary education should be in Punjabi. Universities like Government College University, LUMS, Kinnaird College and Lahore have recently established Punjabi departments or have started offering it as a subject. The bill will soon be tabled in the Parliament and we are lobbying intensely for it. We expect resistance eventually, but so far, no powerful lobby, no “conservative” or Islamist group worth their salt have challenged us.
The girls you see struggling to speak in Punjabi are from one of the few private schools that have allowed Punjabi to be taught. They are still young, learning fast and many of them are passionate about carrying this baton forward. The language is taking baby steps to cover decades of discrimination. Since this is an “elite school”, as the article rightly mentions, we expect these students to hold powerful positions later in life and remember their lessons in Punjabi when they make speeches in public or the Parliament. Many of these students struggle initially but gain fluency within months. When the course started nearly a decade ago, parents were shocked and reluctant. But now, it is a matter of pride in their posh drawing room conversations. This video is a fruit of our passionate activism. Try to appreciate it from Oxford. – Ammara Ahmad
I had deliberately kept the original title as “decoding the new punjabiyat” to make it sound different as the new title does have a somewhat threatening tone. I thank Ammara for the elaborate response. I hope the response is communicated to her. Her statements make personal remarks, such as the word “misintention”, rather than giving an academic criticism.
She asked which “conservative” groups precisely? Answer: Speeches by Khadim Hussain Rizvi, whose party won 4% vote share in Pakistan’s recent elections and got two provincial Assembly seats from Sindh, and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who declared the Kartarpur corridor as Qadiani corridor. One cannot get away by claiming these groups are fringe or irrelevant entities, especially Maulana’s JUI whose pre-2018 elections political prowess needs no introduction. The same goes for Khadim Rizvi’s November 2017 showdown.
I did not write Punjabi is under threat in its entirety but only certain of its aspects, such as the mainstreaming of Hindi as the official language has competed with other smaller dialects to their detriment in India, Urdu’s institutionalisation has its tale to offer.
On the politicisation aspect, could Ms Ammara answer what was the need to display an unexploded bomb in the Gurudwara premises, along with a signboard stating the IAF intended to destroy the Gurudwara in 1971? Add to this a promotional video of Kartarpur featuring Mr Bhindranwale. Here is a link to the Indian Foreign Office’s briefing protesting on the video.
Ms Ammara’s efforts are deeply appreciated and I wish her all the success.But let us not ignore the fact that Indo-Pak rivalry spills out in myriad ways, one of which I highlighted. I have gone to the extent of quoting how both nations tap each others’ diasporas to do useless propaganda activities. My article only addresses how two rival nation states engage with issues with multidimensional effects. – Prateek Joshi

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI - At least 43 people were killed Sunday in a devastating fire that ripped through a bag factory in the congested old quarter of the Indian capital New Delhi, with survivors describing the screams of workers trapped inside.Police and fire officials said they had rescued at least 58 people and did not expect to find more bodies.The blaze was the worst in Delhi since 59 movie-goers died in a cinema in 1997.The cause of the blaze is not yet known, but the city's poor planning and lax enforcement of building and safety codes have often been blamed for such deadly incidents.The building's owner and manager were arrested Sunday, police told the Press Trust of India news agency.Tearful relatives spoke of receiving desperate calls from factory workers begging to be saved from the inferno in the poorly lit premises in the commercial hub of Sadar Bazar. The fire started around 5:00 am (23:30 GMT Saturday).A man named Musharaff who was trapped inside the four-story structure made a desperate phone call to ask that his children be looked after."Monu, brother, I am going to die today," he said in the recording of a call played by the ABP Hindi language news channel."Please take care of my kids. I can't breathe. There are so many others here. Just can't breathe," he kept repeating in Hindi, before finally breaking down.Authorities said they do not know if Musharaff was among the survivors.One man who did survive, Sabi Abbas, told AFP he had just finished work and was about to go to sleep in the factory's modest sleeping quarters when he heard screams from the third floor."I rushed to the floor and saw the wires were dangling and on fire as acrid smoke filled up the corridor," he said, adding that he ran out of the building with his wife and daughters.Such factories often provide sleeping quarters for poor workers, mostly migrant, who save money by bedding down at their workplaces.The building was home to several manufacturing units producing items including schoolbags and packing materials, which fueled the spread of the blaze, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that the fire was "extremely horrific."Authorities promised they would provide financial assistance to victims' families and survivors.Locals said the factory, which also made purses and jackets, had just one entrance; 20 rooms on each floor were connected by a single internal stairway."Most of the casualties happened because of suffocation," witness Mohammed Khalil told AFP."After the fire, people didn't have any way to get out, and I believe many were asleep and because of the smoke, they got suffocated."Others told AFP they believed the fire started on the first floor, sparked by exposed wires, before spreading to an area where foam and plastic chairs were stored.Anxious relatives and friends gathered outside a nearby hospital morgue to identify the bodies.Naushad Ahmad was looking desperately for a missing friend, whom he was unable to reach on his mobile phone."I have been to the factory and this tragedy was waiting to happen," he told AFP."There was only one exit and entrance to the building... People didn't get a chance to escape."After searching for his father-in-law and brother-in-law for two hours, Sajjamuddin Ahmad discovered they were dead, he told AFP.Families of the victims said they were mostly migrant workers from Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states. Some of them were paid just 1,000 rupees ($14) a month, they said.The site had been operating without required fire safety clearances, Delhi's fire services director told the Press Trust of India.The news agency also said that more than 150 firefighters battled for nearly five hours to put out the blaze. -AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cooper Energy poised to get its Sole, Downer leaves site</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Street Talk has been on gas watch.
And in our sights has been Cooper Energy's delayed Sole project in south-eastern Victoria, the state worst hit by the tightness in east coast gas supply.
It's understood contractors from Downer have been demobilising at the Orbost gas plant – owned by APA Group – which would process the gas from the Sole field. Getting this plant up and running is the last hurdle to Sole becoming a producing asset.
[To be clear, APA owns the processing plant while Cooper owns the gas field]
It is expected Downer will hand over the plant's reins to APA in the coming days, which would then begin first phase commissioning and following that would start processing gas from the Sole project.
It's believed the first gas processed from Sole would be in early 2020.
The near completion of the Orbost gas plant would be welcome news for Cooper's management and shareholders. The delay caused the $876 million company to defer production and Cooper was receiving liquidated damages during the deferral period.
The Sole project accounts for 78 per cent of Cooper's gas reserves and is expected to account for around 80 per cent of gas production.
Once production kicks off, the Sole asset would become significantly de-risked. Street Talk would be willing to bet the likes of Beach Energy and Mitsui are watching with interest.
The news comes as oil and gas producer Senex Energy's Atlas project in Queensland delivered its first gas to state-owned power generator CleanCo. Within weeks it will start delivering gas to building products maker CSR.
The Atlas project is the first in Queensland where output is exclusively for domestic use.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Karnataka By-polls Results: 11 rebels labelled defectors by their parties win again on BJP seats</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bengaluru, Dec 09: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka retained majority in the Karnataka Assembly after 11 of the 13 Congress and JD(S) turncoats that the saffron had fielded managed to retain power in the state.
Congress won two seats, Janata Dal Secular (JDS) drew a blank while a BJP rebel won as an Independent candidate.
Jarkiholi Ramesh Laxmanrao, who spearheaded Operation Lotus leading to the fall of the H D Kumaraswamy government managed to win the Gokak seat again for the BJP.
Likewise, Arabail Hebbar Shivaram, Mahesh Iranagouda Kumathalli, K Sudhakar, BA Basavaraja, and ST Somashekar won from Yellapur,Athani, Chikkaballapur, KR Pura and Yeshwanthpur constituencies respectively.
Meanwhile, Anand Singh won the Vijayanagara seat for the BJP again.
The twp rebel leaders who failed to win their seats were N Nagaraju (MTB) and Adaguru H Vishwanath.
Chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who engineered the Congress-JDS rebellion, reiterated that the disqualified legislators who win will be made ministers in his Cabinet.
"They (disqualified MLAs) sacrificed for us. We've promised to make them ministers. There's no question of going back on this promise," Yediyurappa said.
To a question, if the disqualified legislators, who lost the bypolls, will be made ministers, Yediyurappa said "I don't want to discuss this now. In the coming days, we will discuss this with the Central leadrship."
Among the 15 constituencies going for polls, 12 were represented by Congress and three by JD(S).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thrifty father-of-three reveals how he saves £2,000 a year and even gets money off his utility bills - just by scanning his supermarket receipts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A thrifty father-of-three has revealed how he saves more than £2,000 a year using four shopping apps, that he checks on during his lunch break.
Peter Chatfield, 39, from Deal in Kent, scans receipts for bread, milk, yoghurt and chocolate into the apps to claim back part of their cost - and even does this twice when two are running the same offer.
He estimates that he makes £500 in profit from cashback a year, as well as saving £1,500 through special offers.  
The civil servant started counting the pennies seven years ago after his wife Sharon, 39, fell unexpectedly pregnant with their third child just after they had moved into a four-bedroom detached house.
Revealing his savings secrets, Pete told FEMAIL how he monitors the apps Clicksnap, Checkoutsmart, Greenjinn and Shopmium for the latest supermarket offers. 
'It will tell you which goods are on offer and then you go to the supermarket, buy the item, take it home and scan in the receipt. In the same day they send you the money,' he told FEMAIL. 
'You're looking at a minute tops - it takes no time at all.'
Sometimes the apps have the same offers at the same time, allowing Pete to cash in twice for an item and put himself into profit.
They also give him the option of shopping in either Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, ASDA, Waitrose or going online to shop with Ocado. 
Pete raked in five months free fibre broadband from NOW TV Broadband by using an offer from a cashback site and his bank.
After paying for the £25 a month provider he went through TopCashback to get a £90 refund, and then also received a £40 discount through his bank for paying for the service through them.
The refund means Pete only has to pay £14.17 a month, or has five months internet completely free!
On Uswitch NOW TV Broadband was not the cheapest deal, with Origin Superfast Fibre offering only £20 a month internet, but when all the offers were added up the more expensive one ended up saving him more.

'Clicksnap and Checkoutsmart basically have the same offers where you can submit your receipts for both and then you get paid for both.
'The obvious items are usually free but sometimes about half price or a bit over - so you can end up in profit.
Shoppers at Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Ocado can save money with this little-known app. 
It features exclusive offers every week. When FEMAIL checked it offered 75p cashback for Yeo Valley yoghurt buyers, worth £2.75, and £1.15 back for those buying Yorkshire Tea bedtime brew, worth £2.30.
 Shoppers at Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, and Sainsbury's can make savings with this app.
When FEMAIL checked it was offering Jude's ice cream reduced to £1.50, worth £4, and free beef jerky, worth £3.20. It also had deals on Yorkshire Tea bedtime brew and Yeo Valley yoghurt. 
Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Holland & Barrett and Ocado shoppers should use this app.
Downloaded onto your phone, when FEMAIL checked it had 60p off Fruit'n'Fibre cereal, worth £2.79, and 40p off Galbani Mozzarella Maxi cheese, worth £2.25.
Tesco, Sainsbury's, ASDA, Morrisons and Waitrose shoppers can take advantage of this app.
When FEMAIL checked it had 50 per cent off Uncle Ben's One Pot Rice Kit Caribbean Jerk, worth £2.79, and 70 per cent off Morrisons Toffee Apple Crown pastries, worth £1. 
'One time I got about 60p back on bread through an offer on both apps, so it made me a 20p profit plus free bread.'
Pete said he reckons he makes 'well over' £500 in profit a year through this loophole.
'If you're doing all the offers you could probably make £5 to £10 a week just from that', he said. 'That's once you're getting your free stuff as well.' 
The government worker checks the apps during his lunch breaks at work at least once a week, because the offers switch around every week to two weeks.
To rake back in even more pounds, Pete also takes advantage of offers on cashback websites Quidco and TopCashback.
This year, he managed to pair two offers to save £130 and get NOW TV Broadband for free. 
After buying the £25-a-month internet, he got £90 refunded through TopCashback and then a further £40 from his bank Santander for choosing the company. 
The money saved has allowed the family to take the trip of a lifetime to Disneyland, Florida.
Glowing pictures show the thrilled couple and smiling Cara, 10, George, 9, and Amy, 6, in front of the Disney Palace and meeting Mickey and Minnie Mouse at the Animal Kingdom.
Proud father Pete managed the fantastic October holiday through simply saving on shopping and taking advantage of more cashback offers.
'The flights were far cheaper because  we went in October. So, for us it was £1,400 whereas usually peak time you're looking at over £2,000.
'I got cashback through Topcashback for car parking for the car hire, we also got some money back as new customers through Airbnb and travel insurance again was with cashback.'
He took the children for a week during their October half-term and then a further week off that was authorised by the school.
Pete's job has made it almost impossible to get away over the summer, because of preparations for a supposed no-deal Brexit, which didn't come to pass.
Money saving app ZipZero will transfer one per cent of your total bill back to you to spend on utility bills.
After scanning a receipt in on any purchase made in a UK shop, it then immediately makes the money available for gas, water, electricity or another household utility.
With a head office based in London, on its website ZipZero says: 'We founded ZIPZERO because we wanted to find a way to help households get out of the rut of making ends meet.
'For us, paying zero for our monthly bills is everything.'

The family started saving when they were 'really struggling financially' - and haven't stopped since.
'I was desperate to cut bills and make some extra money', said Pete, ' that's how I fell into it.'
Pete said that since starting to save the extra money, the quality of life of his family has been improved.
'It's something I enjoy but, you know, it's taken a lot of financial stress off us so we can relax a lot more', he said.
'My wife is really impressed that I go through these apps, but sometimes rolls her eyes.'
So pleased with his savings, Pete launched blog Household Money Saving where he tells fellow savers about his expert tips for cutting bills on everything including wifi, testing websites and reviewing adverts.
Thrifty father Peter Chatfield, 39, has explained how families should slowly ease themselves into money saving.
'Aim small first because that's how you do it', Pete told FEMAIL.
'People look at these things and think, "oh that's a tiny saving what's the point?", but when you add these things up over a day, over a week, and over a year you know it all adds up.
'It doesn't take much effort and anybody can do any of these things so yeah - start small.'
Pete claimed he had saved more than £2,000 a year since starting, and has even made £500 profit a year when he gets extra money back for buying products.
He achieves this by scanning receipts into apps Clicksnap, Checkoutsmart, Greenjinn and Shopmium.
Since getting into saving he has also set up a blog called Household Money Saving where he tells followers how to save on purchases.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Healy-Rae hospitalised after fire at his Kerry office</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KERRY TD Michael Healy-Rae is being treated in hospital for suspected smoke inhalation after a fire was detected at his property.
The incident occurred at 9am this morning at the politician's Kilgarvan property.
It is understood Mr Healy-Rae was at home pending travelling to Dublin for Dail business.
A fire was detected at the Kilgarvan shop which also serves as Mr Healy-Rae's office and political base.

His office is the rear of the shop previously operated by his father.
He lives around 200m away.
Mr Healy-Rae raced to ensure the property was empty after realising a fire had broken out.
The local fire brigade were immediately alerted.
It is understood the TD was checking that the property was empty and was attempting to save a number of important files when he was partially overcome by smoke.
He was treated at the scene by a doctor before the decision was taken to transfer him to hospital for precautionary tests.
A local ambulance brought him to Kerry hospital.
He is expected to make a full recovery.
Speaking to Independent.ie, his brother Danny Healy-Rae said Michael would be okay.
"He will be fine. He has been taken to hospital as a precaution. They want to give him an x-ray," he said.
An investigation into the cause of the blaze is underway but the belief is that the fire was accidental.
The fire was quickly extinguished by Kerry Fire Brigade.
Four years ago, Mr Healy-Rae narrowly avoided serious injury when he was attacked by a cow on the family farm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Re-run: APC aspirants demand redeployment of REC, top Akwa Ibom INEC officials</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The All Progressives Congress, APC, Aspirants Forum, APCAF, Akwa Ibom state chapter has demanded the redeployment of the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Mike Igini and principal officials at the state Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as the commission prepares to conduct court-ordered rerun elections in Essien Udim local government.
Addressing newsmen in Uyo at the weekend on behalf of the Forum, the state Coordinator, an APC aspirant for the Etinan/Nsit Ubium/Nsit Ibom Federal constituency seat in the 2019 election, Dr Chris Enoch expressed lack of trust and confidence in the electoral umpire under the watch of Igini to conduct the re-run elections without bias.
Enoch alleged that the Commission’s preferential treatment of the PDP and its stakeholders played out during the pre-election meetings of the stakeholders, adding that Igini’s post-election utterances demonstrated his inert hatred and disgust for the APC and its principal actors particularly Senator Godswill Akpabio.
He stressed, “It is worthy of note that on the heels of the Appeal Court judgement on the case of Senator Godswill Akpabio, the candidate of APC in the 2019 election for Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial district in which Akpabio got a favourable ruling, the spokesperson of INEC Akwa Ibom state as directed by Igini, issued a press statement in which Akpabio was vilified and frontally accused of having sponsored thuggery during the election.
“Such a wild accusation smacks of a devilish agenda to poison the minds of the electorates against Akpabio in his local government, Essien Udim in which the rerun has been ordered by the appellate court and which is strategic to Akpabio’s victory and his final emergence as the Senator for the senatorial district.
“INEC’s strategy in that press release is simply pre-emptive and to spoil things for Akpabio. This further buttress the believe that INEC, Akwa Ibom state holds Senator Akpabio in utter disdain and opprobrium”
The APCAF state Coordinator maintained that the statement by INEC was also a glaring prelude for biased conduct of the rerun election in favour of Akpabio’s opponent.
He explained that in advanced democracies gallant losers and magnanimous victors emerge at the end of electoral contest only in a seamless, rancour-free contest impartially supervised by an unbiased and uncompromised umpire guided by the rules of the game, personal morals and ethics.
“No sane institution would allow Igini and his top echelon of officials at the Akwa Ibom State INEC to conduct further elections in Akwa Ibom state, particularly if any APC candidate is involved in the contest. We are saying if this same crop of people are allowed to conduct the rerun election we cannot expect any positive outcome from that exercise.
“As an electoral umpire, you are supposed to remain neutral. We, therefore recommend that due and commensurate action should be taken by INEC headquarters, Abuja to inculcate some noble sense of patriotism and transparency in Mr Igini.
“On the basis of foregoing incontrovertible facts and observations, therefore, we members of APC Aspirants Forum, Akwa Ibom state chapter call for the immediate redeployment of Mr Igini and the posting of a new and impartial REC and INEC principal staff to Akwa Ibom such as would inspire confidence in the electorates preparatory to the conduct of a free fair, and acceptable rerun elections”, he stated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disabled mother, 51, and her nine-year-old autistic son face a homeless Christmas after Hoover tumble dryer blaze destroyed their flat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A disabled mother-of-one and her nine-year-old autistic son are facing Christmas without a home after their tumble dryer went up in flames destroying 'everything they owned'.
Lisa Camilleri, from Shenley, Hertfordshire, was waiting for the three-year-old Hoover dryer to finish its cycle last month when she heard a 'loud bang' and her electricity tripped.
The 51-year-old rushed to her kitchen in the dark before sensing 'glowing' flames behind her. She watched in horror as flames erupted from behind the appliance.  
Ms Camilleri panicked and quickly dialled 999 before running out into the street wearing just her pyjamas and slippers.
By the time the fire service arrived 10 minutes later, her flat had been engulfed in flames and she had 'lost everything.'  
Now the disabled mother faces a 'bleak' Christmas alone as her son Alfie has had to go and stay with his aunt, and she has been moved to temporary accommodation.  
Ms Camilleri has urged others to check their home insurance because she is only getting £5,000 of the £12,500 she desperately needs after failing to keep his list of contents updated.
She said: 'It's very traumatic. Everything has been damaged - most of my flat.
'I've had to get something to help me to sleep because I'm suffering with PTSD. I smell fire and burning everywhere I go. I wake up at night and I hear that bang.
'I've lost everything, but I just thank the Lord I managed to get out. Luckily Alfie wasn't there. Christmas this year is looking bleak.'
Ms Camilleri had owned the dryer for three years and had never had any issues with it until it set on fire in early November.
She said: 'When I first walked [into the kitchen], I didn't even look at the dryer but I could feel something glowing behind me.
'Then I turned around and all I could see were orange flames coming from the back of it.
'I just stood there looking at it. Panic set in and there was smoke, then the windows blew out.
'I managed to get out of the house. I struggled to get the door open, luckily I did, then I called the fire brigade.
'They managed to put out the fire but it had already taken hold of the flat.
'The only door that was closed was my little boy Alfie's bedroom. That's not too bad - it's salvageable.
'I've got to salvage as much as I can because I'd under-insured myself. I'd forgotten to update it when I bought new stuff.
'I have to save my leather sofa and chairs from the smoke damage, my bed, that's got smoke all over it. And Alfie's stuff too.'
Ms Camilleri has now been out of her home for more than a month and is living separately from Alfie to save him from the trauma, as he struggles to adapt to changes due to his suspected autism.
Although her housing association have given her a temporary flat, she claims they refuse to carpet it - leaving her to walk on bare floorboards.
Ms Camilleri said: 'They've found me a temporary house which I'm starting to move into now, but they won't let me stay here [for the future].
'That's the worst thing about it - I cannot go back to my flat, it's too traumatising.
'They won't carpet the new place or anything like that. They said it's not in their policy.
'Alfie's diagnosed with severe anxiety and is waiting to be assessed for autism. He's got a two-year learning delay.
'He won't step foot in this new [temporary accommodation] place until it's absolutely spotless, because any sign of dirt and he goes crazy. All his stuff that I can save needs to be put in place for him.
'It's just so hard. I'm trying to do my best by mopping the floorboards and he's staying with my daughter at the moment.
'I'm expecting to stay here for months, depending on the work needed. There's so much work to be done [on my flat].
'Luckily, I have a supportive family who have been doing as much as they can.'
Ms Camilleri claims she reported the fire to Hoover and was told she needed to go through her insurance.
However, after moving house years earlier, she had taken out home insurance but forgotten to update it as she bought new things for the flat.
Because she was under-insured, Lisa will receive just 42 percent of what is needed to replace her damaged belongings.
The stay-at-home mother and Alfie face a long journey ahead as they try to find £7,000 to repair their flat.
She said: 'The insurance are paying less for my contents because I was under-insured.
'I just hope people read this and remember to keep their contents insurance updated. So many people forget - exactly like I did.'
Hoover claimed they could find no record of Lisa's call to them and said they were informed of the incident by the retailer.
A spokesperson for Hoover said: 'The retailer informed us of the incident on 11th November 2019 and, as per our protocols, contacted the customer to organise inspection of the appliance. 
'We were told that the product had already been taken away on 8th November so unfortunately we have been unable to undertake our own investigation.
'Whilst we sympathise with Ms Camilleri's situation, we are unable to shed any further light on this particular incident as we have been unable to inspect the appliance ourselves. 
'We would of course like to once the customer's insurance company has been in touch and the product is made available to us.
'We would however like to take the opportunity to reiterate that all Hoover appliances conform to all required EU quality and safety requirements and we can confirm that there have been no safety notices on this product.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">APC Invented Hate Speech In Nigeria, Ruling Party Chieftain Admits</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Joshua Alobo, has claimed that his party originated hate speech.
Alobo who is also a human rights advocate was speaking in a reaction to the re-arrest of the Convener of the RevolutionNow Omoyele Sowore.
Sowore who was released on bail by the DSS on Thursday last week was re-arrested in a courtroom by the DSS the following day.
According to the APC chieftain, what the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari interprets as hate speech originated from the APC.
He admitted that he was “seriously embarrassed” by the treatment meted out to Sowore who was “among those who canvassed for the ‘change’ mantra.”
Alobo told Channel TV’s Sunrise Daily, Monday, that  “APC, in which I am a chieftain, originated hate speech.
“Look at what happened at… even Lai Muhammed and the rest, nobody was arrested. Look at the fuel subsidy protest at the freedom square.
“If not that Jonathan was proactive to deploy soldiers…I was in Abuja; even though I wasn’t in the general protest, I was using my vehicle to monitor the whole situation.
“So a lot of showbiz was going on during the Jonathan administration, they don’t look at it as a threat to the government. What is Sowore?
“They are just making the guy to[sic] be too popular, I don’t know him as a person. But they have been reading Sahara Reporters right from Jonathan era, a lot of information has been disclosed and all those things.
Alobo, President of the International Human Rights and Development Centre asked: “So if a media practitioner cannot express his opinion, then what will he do?
“And this is a man that has the pedigree of activism right from University. So, the DSS for goodness sake should not bring another terrorist group.
“It is the suppression of Yusuf Muhammed that escalated into what we have now as Boko Haram.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nairobi governor pleads not guilty to graft charges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nairobi’s governor pleaded not guilty to corruption and other economic crimes involving millions of dollars in a Kenyan court on Monday.
Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko was arrested on Friday and is accused of conspiracy to commit corruption, failure to comply with laws related to procurement, unlawful acquisition of public property and laundering the proceeds of crime.
Chief public prosecutor Noordin Haji has accused Sonko and his associates of the misappropriation of 357 million Kenyan shillings ($3.52 million).
Kenyans and investors have long complained of corruption in Kenya, East Africa’s business hub and the region’s richest economy. President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to crack down on the problem.
Sonko appeared before anti-corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti dressed in a designer shirt sequined with a gold teddy bear under a hooded camouflage jacket.
Police set up barriers on streets around the court and diverted traffic in anticipation of possible trouble after Sonko’s supporters called for protests.
Sonko, a member of Kenyatta’s ruling Jubilee Party, said in a statement on Sunday that his arrest was politically motivated and that he was a law-abiding citizen.
He urged his supporters to avoid any actions that “may threaten the peace”.
“What I ask of you, my supporters is to pray for me. Even all my haters, please pray for me,” the statement, written partly in English and partly in KiSwahili, read.
Sonko was represented in court by a high profile team of Kenyan lawyers including the Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen.
The former senator is a flamboyant figure, known for his glitzy lifestyle, flashy clothes, chunky gold jewelry, and eye-catching hairstyles.
Police used teargas to disperse hundreds of Sonko’s supporters when he was called into the anti-corruption office for questioning in November, as reported by Reuters.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">

In the era of social media and instant messaging, the courts are constantly challenged to develop the common law to accommodate the ever-changing environment. Recently, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) was asked to pronounce on whether a WhatsApp message, in which a man indicated he would pay each of his children R1 million if he won R20 million, gave rise to an enforceable contract.
It transpired that the appellant, Mr Ntsieni Kgopana, actually won R20,814,582 in the National Lottery (Lotto). When questioned about his winnings by the respondent, who is the mother of one of the appellant’s seven children, the appellant denied that he had won the Lotto and sent her a WhatsApp message saying: “If I get 20m I can give all my children 1m and remain with 13m…”
When the respondent obtained proof that the appellant had, in fact, won the Lotto, she relied on the appellant’s WhatsApp message to claim payment of the R1 million for her minor child.
The high court found that the WhatsApp message constituted a binding agreement and ordered the appellant to pay the amount owed to the mother of his child.
However, on December 2 2019, the SCA overturned the high court’s decision and held that the WhatsApp message did not contain an offer that could, on acceptance thereof, be converted into an enforceable agreement. In interpreting the message, the SCA held that the context strongly suggested that the appellant never intended to agree to part with a portion of his winnings and that the message simply relayed what the appellant could do in the hypothetical future event of him receiving R20 million.
Even though the SCA found in the present case that the WhatsApp message was not a binding contract, it does not mean that a WhatsApp message can never give rise to binding legal obligations.
As a general rule, there are no prescribed formalities for the conclusion of a contract. All that is required is an offer and an acceptance, and consequently, consensus between the contracting parties. It is also important to note that acceptance of an offer need not be expressed in words, as it can also be established by conduct, from which the inference of acceptance can logically be drawn.
Individuals must, therefore, exercise caution when negotiating or making offers online and via instant messaging as those expressions could create legally binding agreements.

It comes after Blackpool's owner officially opened the state-of-the-art education and community centre ahead of Saturday's game against Fleetwood Town.
Before cutting the ribbon with a pair of comically oversized scissors, Sadler provided some words to those supporters in attendance.
"The Community Trust is quite clearly the link between the football club and the community," he said.
"One of the reasons I bought the club in the first place was to strengthen the links between the club and the town.
"This building is a great symbol of that."
The centre, which has already been functional for six weeks, is based on the site of the old club shop and ticket office in the North West corner of Bloomfield Road.
It has since been transformed into an education and community centre, which includes four tailor-made classrooms, a family and game zone, community gym and a physical activity space.
The facility has been developed with £286,000 funding from the Premier League and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, through the Football Foundation and a further £125,000 from the Community Trust itself.
The Trust has been given a 25-year lease on the area.
The facility will be used to host Blackpool FC Sports College, home to the Trusts BTEC Education, Degree and Traineeship courses, as well as community-based activity, including sporting memories, veterans’ social groups and Premier League Kicks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Official: Base shooter watched shooting videos before attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PENSACOLA, Fla. — The Saudi student who fatally shot three sailors at a U.S. naval base in Florida hosted a dinner party earlier in the week where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Saturday.
Officials investigating the deadly attack were working Saturday to determine whether it was motivated by terrorism, while President Donald Trump indicated he would review policies governing foreign military training in the United States.
The Navy on Saturday identified the three victims and hailed them as heroes for trying to stop the shooter and flagging down first responders after being shot.
“The Sailors that lost their lives in the line of duty and showed exceptional heroism and bravery in the face of evil," Capt. Tim Kinsella, the commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola, said in a statement. “When confronted, they didn’t run from danger; they ran towards it and saved lives."
The shooter opened fire inside a classroom at the naval base on Friday, killing three people and wounding two sheriff's deputies, one in the arm and one in the knee, before one of the deputies killed him. Eight others were also hurt. Both deputies were expected to survive.
The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.
Ten Saudi students were being held on the base Saturday while several others were unaccounted for, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities.
The FBI identified the shooter in a statement Saturday night as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21. Investigators said he was a 2nd Lt. in the Royal Saudi Air Force and was a student naval flight officer of Naval Aviation Schools Command. A U.S. official on Friday said the FBI was examining social media posts and investigating whether he acted alone or was connected to any broader group. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
Two U.S. officials said Friday that authorities were investigating whether the attack was terrorism-related. They spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose information that had not yet been made public.
In remarks at a gathering of top U.S. defense and military officials on Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper was asked whether he could say definitively that the shooting was an act of terrorism.
“No, I can’t say it’s terrorism at this time,” he said, adding that the investigation needs to proceed. He declined to discuss details of the investigation so far.
President Trump also declined to say whether the shooting was terrorism-related. The president tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims on Friday and noted that Saudi King Salman had reassured him in a telephone call that the shooter “in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people."
But in comments echoing those made earlier by Esper, Trump said Saturday that he would review policies governing foreign military training in the U.S.
The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. Currently, more than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the U.S. going through military training.
“This has been done for many decades,” Trump said. “I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately."
Speaking at the Ronald Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, on Saturday, Esper and others downplayed any initial impact on U.S.-Saudi ties.
Asked whether he would now hesitate to send U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia, he said, “No, not at all.” He said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have shared security interests, especially with regard to Iran.
The shooting has shined a light on the sometimes rocky relationship between the two countries, however.
The kingdom is still trying to recover from the killing last year of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi intelligence officials and a forensic doctor killed and dismembered Khashoggi on Oct. 2, 2018, just as his fiancée waited outside the diplomatic mission.
Naval Air Station Pensacola is one of the Navy's most historic and storied bases. It sprawls along the waterfront southwest of the city's downtown and dominates the economy of the surrounding area.
Part of the base resembles a college campus, with buildings where, in addition to foreign students, 60,000 members of the U.S. Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard train each year in multiple fields of aviation.
Kinsella said the base would remain closed until further notice.
Residents of Pensacola mourned the attacks and offered their condolences to affected members of the community.
Family members on Saturday identified one of the victims as a 23-year-old recent graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who alerted first responders to where the shooter was even after he had been shot several times.
“Joshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own," his older brother Adam Watson wrote on Facebook. “He died a hero and we are beyond proud."
A second victim was identified as Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Haitham's mother, Evelyn Brady, herself a Navy veteran, said the commander of her son's school called her and told her Haitham had tried to stop the shooter.
The former track and field star had been assigned to flight crew training and was looking forward to graduating from the program later this month, Brady said.
“He said he was going to get his flight jacket for Christmas,” she said. “Now that’s not going to happen.”
The Navy identified the third victim as Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia. All three were students at Naval Aviation Schools Command.
The shooting is the second at a U.S. naval base in one week. A sailor whose submarine was docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, opened fire on three civilian employees Wednesday, killing two before taking his own life.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in a suicide attack in southern Helmand province on Monday, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) said in a statement.
The attack took place about 10am local time after a suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives close to a security checkpoint in Nad Ali district, the statement said.
“The security forces identified the bomber and starting shooting at the truck, but the bomber detonated his explosive,” it said.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Asian stocks edged up on Monday, catching some of Wall Street’s momentum after surprisingly strong US jobs data although regional gains were capped by concerns about China’s economy due to the prolonged Sino-US trade war. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.3% while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3%, with Australian stocks and South Korea’s Kospi up 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The dollar held firm on Monday after data showed surprise strength in the US jobs market, but the currency was restrained from moving higher by worries about an escalation in the US-China trade war. The dollar index stood almost flat at 97.704 in early Asian trade on Monday, after rising 0.3% on Friday, Reuters reported.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bolton Muslim Girls School can expand to take extra 150 pupils</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best-performing school in Bolton is set to expand by 150 pupils over the next five years as plans for its future have been approved.
Bolton Muslim Girls School has been granted planning permission to build a four-storey side extension.
The school, which will increase its student numbers from 600 to 750, can now also use the second and third floors of the mill building it is located in for educational purposes.
The expansion will allow the school to add design and technology as well as drama to its curriculum.
Work at the site is due to start in January and an additional intake of 30 pupils per year is planned.
Deputy head Helen Andiyapan warned delays to the expansion of the “oversubscribed” school would put £2.2m of funding at risk.
She said: “There will be a local shortage of places if this expansion does not go ahead. We are aware of the concerns raised and have tried our utmost to address these in the best nature possible.”
The planning committee approved the application last week despite residents raising concerns about increased traffic in the area.
Hanif Kola spoke on behalf of residents objecting to the proposal at a town hall meeting on Thursday.
He said that residents had tried to be fair and take a “balanced” approach with the school, but concerns had “fallen on deaf ears”.
They asked for each class to have an assigned entrance to ease congestion and demanded this becomes school policy so that it can be enforced.
He said: “We support the school and its efforts to expand its teaching provision but to have one access and entry point for a further 150 students is a major health and safety issue for the school, medical centre and the residents which cannot be compromised or overlooked in any way.”
Rumworth councillor Shamim Abdullah, who requested that the planning committee discusses the plans and makes the final decision, said that residents in her ward felt that the roads around the school cannot cope with traffic as it is.
However, she was satisfied that the school had taken appropriate measures to mitigate these problems.
Cllr Elaine Sherrington said: “The difficulty with the school is the fact that it is in an old mill. It was never designed to be a school and it’s in one of the most built up areas in the town.
“At the end of the day, the school is where it is and there’s nothing we can do about that.

“I think if we talk about expansion in the future, I don’t think we can go over five-storeys.
“At that stage I think they would have to look at a brand new site.”
Plans were passed unanimously.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Johannesburg - Former anti-apartheid activist and economics professor Ben Turok had died, his family confirmed on Monday morning.
Turok died in the early hours of Monday morning, his family said in a statement. He was 92. 
“The Turok family are very sad to announce the passing of Ben Turok, their much-loved husband, father, uncle, grandfather and great grandfather, in the early hours of Monday, December 9, aged 92.
"He was always outspoken and dedicated his whole life to fighting for freedom, equality and social justice in South Africa. He was a loyal, lifetime member of the ANC, but retained an independent perspective throughout."
The family said Turok had asked for his death to be marked by a private ceremony "rather than anything official or formal, in view of the present predicament facing the country".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"When the light begins to fade, I sometimes feel a little strange, A little anxious when it's dark". Derrière ces mots de la chanson "Fear of the dark" du fameux groupe de heavy Metal des année 70 Iron Maiden, nous trouvons un mod quelque peu étrange mais qui présente un travail acharné. Même si nous trouvons le nom commun (et aussi le look discutable), le mod que nous vous présentons n'a rien à voir avec ce groupe.
Littéralement Iron maiden signifie la vierge de fer. Et c'est sur ce thème que le moddeur Ali Abbas a travaillé. Beaucoup de travail à la main, le moddeur s'étant mis le défi de n'utiliser que des outils guidés à la main. Du bois donc avec une peinture maitrisée pour ressembler à du fer forgé, des jeux de lumière et le bien connu Cosmos C700M de Cooler Master se transforme en prison pour composants et finalement ressembler de plus en plus à la citation en introduction. Il suffit de regarder la vidéo pour le comprendre.
Vous pouvez aussi suivre le travail et admirer le résultat avec beaucoup plus de photos en suivant la source.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of both Vijay and Shankar are eager to see them team up yet again for a film and of late, rumours have been doing the rounds regarding such a possible project. Now, according to reports, director Shankar himself has come up with a statement, which has further strengthened the belief that a film from Vijay-Shankar combo is definitely on cards.
It was during a recent award function that director Shankar opened up about the film with Vijay. When quizzed about such a project, the ace filmmaker mentioned that he and actor Vijay are ready for such a movie and the project might happen anytime soon.
Well, this response of the maverick filmmaker has left everyone quite excited. Earlier, Shankar and Vijay had teamed up for Nanban, the Tamil remake of the superhit Bollywood movie 3 Idiots, which had hit theatres in 2012. The movie turned out to be a huge success at the box office.
Meanwhile, Shankar is busy with the works of his next mega venture Indian 2, featuring Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The shoot of the film, which is one among the most-awaited upcoming movies of Tamil cinema, is currently progressing and there are huge expectations on the film, which brings back the iconic character Senapathy from Indian.
On the other hand, Vijay is busy with Thalapathy 64, which is being directed by young filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj. The movie is expected to come to theatres during the upcoming summer season.
Well, it needs to be seen whether Thalapathy 65 will be directed by Shankar. Various rumours have been doing the rounds regarding Thalapathy 65 and the director of Vijay's next movie after the upcoming project. Let us wait for the official updates to get a clear picture regarding all of these.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bloemfontein Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema applauded his Kaizer Chiefs counterpart Ernst Middendorp after Amakhosi came from behind three times during their Absa Premiership clash at the weekend to eventually win 5-3.
Celtic exposed Chiefs’ lackluster defending in the first half, but could not keep up later on in the game as the log leaders fought back in the eight-goal thriller.

“We created chances and played the way we wanted to play and until we conceded the two goals. We had done our homework and tried everything, but they proved too strong,” Seema told reporters after the game.
“If someone is stronger than you in certain departments, you will always come out second best. They saw that set pieces would surely help them get the edge over us. We will have to go back and work hard again.”
Seema said part of their surrender later in the match was due to not having their regulars against a full strength Chiefs outfit.
“Not making an excuse, but we are patching up here and there because of the injuries – the experienced guys are not there. And when you come up against Chiefs, with a very good coach that I know very well, it was always going to be difficult,” the Celtic mentor explained.  
“We haven’t played with the same squad we started the season with because of the injuries. We lost another centre-back again through suspension for the next match.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Gauteng government has revealed a multibillion-rand strategy to restore the dignity of children and the poor in the province.
On Sunday, acting MEC for Social Development and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi announced Gauteng’s anti-poverty strategy to eliminate urban hunger and inequality.
“The strategy will protect the poor, the weak and vulnerable by providing solid services that will move them from dependency to independence.
“It will remove some beneficiaries from relying on social grants to work opportunities within government projects,” said Lesufi.
The strategy would start immediately with protecting children, especially those in child-headed families. Lesufi said the strategy aimed to benefit about 160000 children with 20000 children targeted this festive season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In his absence and on his comeback, striker Tammy Abraham shows why he is so important to Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tammy Abraham has emerged as Chelsea’s talisman thanks to a breakthrough season that has taken his side to the brink of the Champions League last 16.
Just 18 months ago, Abraham was one of a host of Chelsea players packed off for yet another loan spell that seemed to indicate his chances of ever shining with the Blues were slim to non-existent.
But Abraham’s time in the Championship with Aston Villa proved the making of the young striker and Chelsea are reaping the rewards.
Now Abraham stands as the undisputed leader of Chelsea’s attack, with his powerful presence and predatory instincts making him an essential part of Frank Lampard’s precocious team.
If Chelsea are to secure the win they need to make the Champions League knockout stages, then it is Abraham who is likely to play the key role in the Group H clash with Lille at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.
Abraham is just 22 and is playing only his second season in the top-flight, but the England international’s huge value to Chelsea was clear to see over the last 10 days.
When he was sidelined with a hip injury for their London derby against West Ham, Abraham’s absence left Chelsea looking impotent as they slumped to a shock 1-0 defeat.
But just days later, Abraham was back in the starting line-up and Chelsea were revitalised as he produced a goal and an assist in a 2-1 win against Aston Villa.
Abraham, a product of Chelsea’s youth academy, already has 11 Premier League goals this season and 12 in all competitions.
It is a far cry from his dismal loan spell at Swansea in 2017-18 when his lack of goals and subdued performances led some to suggest the Londoner wasn’t cut out for the Premier League.
But Abraham hit 26 goals in 40 matches on loan at Villa, helping them win promotion from the Championship and catching Lampard’s eye during his one-season reign at second tier Derby.
When he took charge at Chelsea, Lampard was unable to sign players due to a transfer ban, a predicament that accelerated Abraham’s rise to the first-team.
He has taken his opportunity emphatically but, as Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta points out, it isn’t just goals that make Abraham so vital.
“Not only is he scoring goals he is playing for the team, recovering the ball; he made a tackle in our own half that was an amazing effort for him,” Azpilicueta said after the Villa game.
“He made an assist as well. I am not just looking into his goals as a number because he is doing more than that.”
Asked just how far Abraham can go after his superb first half of the season, Azpilicueta said: “I am confident that he can get many more goals because of the way he is working and improving.
“It is amazing and he has the potential to go even higher. We know we are still in December with a lot of games but with his passion and hunger, he is capable of getting to the top, for sure.
“He showed his desire in pre-season to be a striker for Chelsea. It is something he has dreamt about and he worked for it all the way through the academy. He got his chance and is making the most of it.”
Lampard believes Abraham’s desire to make his mark will keep him firing on all cylinders as Chelsea enter the hectic Christmas programme with a do-or-die showdown with Lille.
Lampard’s team can’t be certain of progressing to the last 16 unless they win their final group game and the boss said: “He’s a personality that’s growing in our dressing room every day with his enthusiasm and his will to win.
“All you say is, as they come, game after game, can you keep scoring, can you stay hungry and what can you do for the team.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cardinal Tagle gets new Vatican post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pope Francis has named Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle as the new Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.
Tagle’s appointment was announced in Rome, Italy on Sunday noon (7 p.m. Manila time), said a Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines News post.
He will replace Cardinal Fernando Filoni who was appointed as the new Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher.
Tagle’s appointment marks the return of an Asian cardinal to the leadership of the important congregation for evangelization after Indian Cardinal Ivan Dias who served from 2006 to 2011.
The Vatican News said the Pope “once again shows great attention to the Asian continent.”  The announcement was made near the end of his trip to Thailand and Japan. Tagle will be installed at the Vatican early next year.
Tagle, 62, was ordained priest for the Diocese of Imus in 1982. Saint John Paul II named him bishop of the diocese in 2001. In October 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Archbishop of Manila, and as cardinal in 2012.
He has been serving as president of Caritas Internationalis, the Vatican’s social action arm since 2015.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Airtel Launches No-expiry Data and Voice Bundles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Airtel Kenya on Monday, December 9, launched no expiry data and call rates that will allow customers to spend as low as 1 bob for 5MB data and to make calls at 2bob across all networks.
At the same time, the company also revamped its entire Amazing data bundle offerings to give more data for the same cost as before e.g. 3GB for Kshs300 up from 1.5GB, 5GB for Kshs500 up from 4GB and 12GB for Kshs1000 up from 10GB with 30days validity.
The new offerings are targeted towards customers who are looking to meet their communication needs with ease and not worry about any hidden costs or conditions. To active the new rates, customers need to dial *544*2#.
The new products campaign dubbed ‘BeSureNaAirtel’ is pegged on showing customers the exact rates and value they get for their investment. The new offers have no hidden charges or conditions for use, thus customers are assured of getting what they pay for at the most competitive rates.
Speaking at the launch event, Airtel’s Managing Director, Prasanta Das Sarma stated, "We are pleased to introduce the industry’s best no expiry rates for data and voice to all our customers. We have also revamped our Amazing data bundles to cater for our heavy data users, by offering up to 100% more data."
"These new offerings are based on emerging consumer insights and trends that show a substantial increase in data usage for both social and business needs as well as the need for customers to not worry about the cost of data while browsing," he stated.
He expressed his confidence that the new rates and revamped bundles will meet all the communication needs of Airtel’s customers even with as low airtime balance as Kshs1.
Airtel continues to invest in the business to bring more innovative products and services and enhance its network coverage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jo Swinson reveals she has been advised to wear 'lower cut tops' amid fears that the Lib Dem campaign is failing to win over voters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson today revealed she has been urged to wear lower cut tops to boost her party's electoral chances.
Ms Swinson said the extraordinary tip was among a welter of 'unsolicited advice' she has received on how to revive her flagging campaign.
Fears have been mounting that the Lib Dems are failing to win over voters, with the party's 'hard Remain' stance and a Labour squeeze blamed for a slump in the polls.
But Ms Swinson's own personal ratings have also been dire, now rivalling Jeremy Corbyn at the bottom of the charts.  
Pressed on BBC Breakfast today over what she could do to turn the situation around, Ms Swinson said people had been urging her to speak and dress differently.  
She said: 'I get lots and lots of unsolicited advice. I'm not short of people telling me that I should speak differently or wear different shoes or wear different earrings. 
'Or in one case, somebody suggested that I should wear lower cut tops. 
'I mean as if that's going to be the thing that changes the poll rating. I'm not short of unsolicited advice.' 
Asked if the 'advice' was coming from her own election team, she said: 'Not in my election team, but as I say, I do get these gems of advice that come to me. 
'I am who I am and some people will not like the way that I dress or talk or my accent or whatever. 
'And fine. In a sense that's their problem. I'm going to stand here, do the best that I can arguing for the positions that I believe in because I do believe our politics can be better. 
'And I'm going to be true to myself in the way I do it.' 
Ms Swinson came under fire at a Channel 4 debate last night in which a furious voter accused her of being a 'Tory in disguise'. 
A woman in the audience said: 'You're a Tory in disguise, state what you are. You dare to try and raise taxes on lower earners when the country is in austerity. How dare you.'
Ms Swinson replied to her critic by saying: 'And we need to end that [austerity] by investing in our public services and we need to be honest about how we do that.
'If you look at the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, they have looked at the Labour plan and they say they are not credible.'
The comeback saw shadow education secretary Angela Rayner launch into an angry tirade, yelling at the former coalition minister: 'You voted for the bedroom tax, you voted for austerity, you voted for tuition fees.
'You did that nine years ago - apologise for tuition fees.'
The Lib Dem leader responded by accusing Labour of 'making a list of promises that you cannot deliver'. 
Ms Swinson also brought up her cannabis use when asked to identify the 'naughtiest' thing she had ever done. 
'I did smoke a fair bit of cannabis at university,' she told PA. 'It wasn't just one, and I did inhale.
'I don't know whether that counts as particularly naughty, but your readers and viewers will be able to make up their own mind on that.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Probe underway into $3.3M fraud at Telenor bank</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Several employees at Telenor’s Pakistan-based Microfinance Bank were accused of helping scam the operation out of NOK30 million ($3.3 million), Norwegian business publication Dagens Naeringsliv reported.
Staff at the bank, which runs mobile money operation Easypaisa, are suspected of approving fake loan applications with external parties also implicated in the scam.
Although no specific details have been provided by either the operator or bank, the newspaper estimates more than 1,600 fraudulent loans had been processed since February 2017. The accused employees deny all charges.
Telenor’s operation in Pakistan is investigating and will report any further suspected fraudulent activity to the country’s police. On Saturday (7 December), several of the accused appeared at a preliminary hearing in Lahore, which was subsequently adjourned.
The operation is owned by Telenor and Alipay parent Ant Financial, after the latter purchased a 45 per cent stake in the venture in 2018 with a commitment to pump fresh funds into the business.
Its current fraud case refers to activity at just one of the 171 Telenor Microfinance branches, Pakistan Today reported, with activity at other offices also said to be under investigation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Halting demands for indyref2 once again at the heart of Scottish Tory campaign</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While three parties campaigned against independence in 2014, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw insists his is the only one that can now be relied upon to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon.
As they did under previous leader Ruth Davidson, the Tories have focused their campaign strategy around a defence of the Union.
Mr Carlaw is unashamed about this, saying: “Our message is stop indyref2, it is take on Nicola Sturgeon and make her focus on the appalling record of failure in Scotland’s public services.”
And with voters apparently believing Jeremy Corbyn would grant the SNP leader the second vote on independence that she craves, Mr Carlaw says his party are now winning over traditional Labour voters in the party’s former west of Scotland heartlands.
And despite Boris Johnson’s unpopularity – a recent poll have him a net approval rating in Scotland of -52 – Mr Carlaw says the Tories are getting a “fantastic response in certain key seats”.
He spoke of a “sense that the Conservative vote is holding firmly in Scotland”.
Mr Carlaw added: “There are other people, particularly old Labour unionists who are dismayed by what Corbyn is doing and saying who are thinking ‘I want to stop Nicola Sturgeon, how do I do it’.
“If you want to stop Nicola Sturgeon, I think in this election, the Conservatives who are now Scotland’s opposition party, are the party to do it.
“I’m getting feedback that we are having a fantastic response in certain key seats, particularly in the west of Scotland, where that old Labour unionist vote exists, those people are dismayed by what Jeremy Corbyn is doing.”
While the Tories united with Labour and the Liberal Democrats to fight to keep Scotland in the UK in the run up to the 2014 referendum, Mr Carlaw said five years on from that vote, “people have increasingly come to see that actually only one of those unionist parties can be relied upon to be firm and resolute in standing up for the Union”.
He added: “They believe Jeremy Corbyn is quite prepared to do a deal with Nicola Sturgeon on a second independence referendum if that gets him into Downing Street.
“They look at the Liberal Democrats….. but they have been quite confused in their messaging as the campaign has gone on, and their ratings have slumped.
“I think increasingly people are saying if I want to stop Nicola Sturgeon which party is going to do it, and there is only one, that’s the Scottish Conservatives, the party I am leading.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">31 rescued from B'Haram's den in Borno forest - The Nation Newspaper</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Okodili Ndidi, Abuja
 
Again troops have rescued thirty-one persons including fourteen women and seventeen children from a Boko Haram hideout in Malam Masari and Gabchari Villages in Bama Council Area of Borno State.
During the operation, one Boko Haram fighter was killed and all the terrorists’ enclaves within the area were destroyed.
It will be recalled that twelve women and four children were earlier rescued from the insurgents’ den along the Cameroonian border by troops who dislodged the terrorists during a recent operation.
The Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, also disclosed that one of the Boko Haram fighters, Abba Modu, voluntarily surrendered to troops of the 3 Battalion in Gamboru, Ngala Council Area of Borno State.
A statement signed by Iliyasu informed that “preliminary investigation revealed that he (Abba Modu) joined the sect in 2015 and was a member of Mamman Nur group. He also disclosed that he actively participated in rustling cattle for the sect”.
The statement continued that, “in yet another display of gallantry and patriotism, the combined troops of 68/94 Battalions of Operation LAFIYA DOLE deployed at Malam Fatori in Abadam LGA of Borno State conducted an aggressive fighting patrol to a location earlier reported by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE as harbouring some activities of the Boko Haram criminal elements.
“The troops successfully uncovered the enclave and proceeded to engage it with devastating volumes of fire. Without any attempt to return fire, the cowardly criminals scampered into the nearby bushes in complete disarray. Subsequently, the troops immediately embarked on an exploitation of this success by pursuing them along their withdrawal route. During the said exploitation, troops discovered the body of one Boko Haram terrorist and further observed several trails of blood along the said route.
“Additionally, 2 AK 47 Rifles, 2 AK 47 Rifle magazines loaded with 30 rounds of 7.62mm Special ammunition each, 3 unexploded Mortar bombs for making of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were captured from the insurgents. Other items equally captured include, one bundle of IED cable, one IED battery, one camel bag, 3 motorcycles, 3 sets of overall cloths, bedding materials, cooking utensils, food items, motorcycle spare parts, 122 cylinder tubes and various mechanical tools”.
Iliyasu stressed further that, “in a related development that occurred on 3 December 2019, the criminal Boko Haram elements suffered a similar defeat in the hands of the troops of 144 Battalion deployed at Limankara in Gwoza LGA of Borno State during a failed attempt to infiltrate the troops’ location.
” During the exploitation exercise that followed the brief firefight with the marauding criminals, the troops discovered burnt body parts of 3 Boko Haram criminals hit by a Rocket Propelled Grenade bomb explosion as well as some broken AK 47 Rifle parts and traces of blood along the criminals’ withdrawal route.
“Furthermore, on 3 December 2019, troops of 101 Task Force Battalion deployed at Cross Kauwa in Kukawa LGA of Borno State made contact with some marauding Boko Haram criminals while conducting Clearance Operations along Cross Kauwa – Monguno Road. The visibly shaken Boko Haram criminals who evidently couldn’t stand the troops superiority fled for safety. Nevertheless, the unrelenting troops went on a hot pursuit and arrested two of the criminals. In another development that occurred on 4 December 2019, troops of 68/94 Battalions deployed at Malam Fatori in Abadam LGA of Borno State conducted a successful ambush at a Boko Haram criminals crossing point North East of the town and neutralised one Boko Haram criminal while many others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.
“However, the troops recovered some vandalised roofing sheets, 33 IED detonator cords and other IED making materials. Preliminary investigation revealed that the criminals are part of IED laying party along the route.
“In another successful ambush operation conducted by the troops of 21 Special Armoured Brigade on 4 December 2019, at Darel Jamel, Bama LGA of Borno State, the troops neutralised one Boko Haram terrorist while several others escaped with gunshot wounds. Same troops also conducted a robust clearance operation same day and cleared Boko Haram criminals’ hideouts at Mantari, Malam Masari and Gabchari Villages in Bama LGA of Borno State. During the Operation, troops neutralised one Boko Haram criminal and destroyed all discovered terrorists’ enclaves within the area. It is gratifying to note that, the troops also rescued 31 persons comprising 14 women and 17 children from the insurgents.
“The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai has, therefore, commended the troops for the exceptional display of gallantry, professionalism and responsiveness. He, however, admonishes them to remain resilient and continue to mount pressure on the Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) criminal elements as their end is obviously in sight”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kenney and cabinet ministers in Ottawa to meet federal counterparts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA - Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and eight of his cabinet ministers will be in Ottawa today as part of a trip to meet their federal counterparts.
Kenney will speak at the Canadian Club this afternoon and later host a reception.
He is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday to discuss issues ranging from pipelines to equalization.
Kenney has said he will bring up with Trudeau a resolution passed unanimously at the recent meeting of provincial leaders to consider changes to the fiscal stabilization fund.
The fund helps provinces facing year-over-year declines in non-resource revenues, but Alberta says it is being shortchanged due to caps tied to the size of its population.
Kenney says Alberta should receive about $2.4 billion going back to 2014, and that the federal government is open to discussing the proposal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Star Trek' actor Rene Auberjonois dead at age 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles - Actor Rene Auberjonois, known for his television roles on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and the US sitcom "Benson," died Sunday in Los Angeles after a battle with cancer. He was 79.
"We are heartbroken to confirm that Rene passed away today," a statement on the actor's website said.
In his official biography, the cause given was metastatic lung cancer.
Auberjonois earned legions of fans for his role as Odo, the shape-shifting head of security on "Star Trek Deep Space Nine," one of the many spinoff series spawned by the legendary science fiction show.
He became a fan favorite at 'Star Trek' conventions for years, donating the proceeds from autographed items to charities, such as Doctors Without Borders.
"I have had my share of successes and my share of flops. But nothing has ever been like this. 'Deep Space Nine' is completely beyond anything that I have ever experienced," the actor once said.
But he also was known for his portrayal in the 1980s of Clayton Endicott III, the chief of staff to a governor on the long-running sitcom "Benson."
Other career highlights include his appearance in Robert Altman's 1970 film "MASH" as Father Mulcahy; a role on the quirky TV drama "Boston Legal"; and a host of voice roles in animated fare, including his performance as Chef Louis in Disney's "The Little Mermaid."
Auberjonois, the son of a writer, grew up in Paris and New York, where his family lived in an artists' colony.
After university, he broke into showbiz on the stage, and earned a Tony award for his first Broadway musical, "Coco" -- about the life of French fashion designer Coco Chanel -- opposite Katharine Hepburn in the title role.
'Star Trek' star William Shatner -- who worked with Auberjonois on "Boston Legal" -- led tributes on Twitter, remembering his "wonderful friendship" with the actor, and fellow series regular George Takei called it a "terrible loss."
"When I look out to the stars, I shall think of you, friend," Takei wrote.
Auberjonois is survived by his wife Judith and two children, Tessa and Remy-Luc.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale rules out Premier League return?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With Bale's future being a constant topic for debate over the past 12 months, the Wales international has naturally been linked with another spell in England's top flight.
Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - one of Bale's former clubs - have been linked with an approach for the 30-year-old during the January window.
However, reports in Spain indicate that the attacker is not interested in returning to a league which involves frequent pressure from the media, instead preferring to move to a division which comes under less scrutiny.
While Real are said to be happy to part ways with Bale, it has been claimed that Los Blancos want to include him in a part-exchange deal for United midfielder Paul Pogba as they bid to avoid shelling out a large fee for the World Cup winner.
Bale still has over two-and-a-half years left on his contract at the Bernabeu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Official portrait of former premier Kathleen Wynne to be unveiled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO - The official portrait of Ontario's first female premier is set to be unveiled at the legislature later today.
TVO reports that Kathleen Wynne's picture was done by artist Linda Kooluris-Dobbs, who also painted the official portraits of former premier David Peterson and former lieutenant-governor Hal Jackman.
Wynne became premier in 2013 after winning the Liberal leadership following her predecessor Dalton McGuinty's resignation.
She took the party from a minority government to a majority one in 2014, but after a few years her popularity sharply declined and the Liberals were reduced to third place -- not enough for official party status in the legislature -- in the 2018 election.
Wynne introduced many popular policies, such as ones to fight climate change, free tuition for low-income students and an increase to the minimum wage, but was widely criticized over quickly rising electricity rates, the partial privatization of Hydro One, and plunging the province back into deficit.
Wynne's north Toronto seat was one of the few the Liberals retained in the last election, and she continues to sit as a member of provincial parliament.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">
President Cyril Ramaphosa, 22 August 2019. Picture: Gallo Images
This week’s edition of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s weekly letters to the nation, “From the Desk of the President”, has left a bitter taste in the mouth of many, based on the reactions on social media.
In the letter, Ramaphosa calls power station Medupi “a fitting symbol of the importance of our state-owned enterprises”.
“Despite the depth of current challenges, none of our SOEs is lost. They can all be saved. But it will take extraordinary effort and, in some cases, tough decisions,” the president writes.
Harsh criticism online came from people including journalists Ferial Haffajee, Ray Mahlaka, and Erin Bates, political analyst Daniel Silke, and activist Zackie Achmat.
Both Mahlaka and Bates described the president’s letter as “tone-deaf”.
“The number one citizen gloating about a serially late and budget-blowing Medupi Power Station. Gloating about a looting scheme,” Mahlaka tweeted.
“No mention of how his administration plans to yank the country out of darkness in the interim. So tone-deaf [and] out of touch with reality,” he added.
As part of a long thread, Bates responded to the president calling Medupi a fitting symbol of SA state-owned enterprises.
“Medupi is, in another argument, a ‘fitting symbol’ of poor governance and mega-projects.
“Construction began 12 years ago, the plant is still incomplete and earlier this year, [Eskom’s] Jabu Mabuza said the final cost is anticipated to be R18 billion”.
Later in the thread, she asks: “Was the desk of the president well-lit while he was writing? Meanwhile [load shedding] is ongoing and doesn’t get so much as a mention.”
According to Haffajee: “Medupi is a ‘fitting symbol’ Fo sho. Late. Expensive. Strike prone. Effed up.”
“We want to know what is wrong with [Eskom] now and how it will be fixed Mr President,” tweeted Achmat.
“You don’t need to worry about the delivery of most expensive useless and corrupt present. Father Christmas will place under a tree. He will bring Medupi one day.”
Silke, meanwhile, reacted to Ramaphosa saying in the letter that he was struck by Medupi’s “massive size”.
“What would strike one about [Medupi] is precisely how massive it is – a massively over-budget, non-performing installation massively damaging the [SA economy] – that’s how massive it is,” he tweeted.
Several Twitter users also reacted to Ramaphosa saying it was his first visit to Medupi, questioning why he hadn’t visited before as deputy president, president, or as the person appointed by former president Jacob Zuma to oversee the turnaround of three state-owned enterprises, including Eskom, in 2014.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trócaire appeals to Louth for support for families living in war zones this Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week the Irish overseas development agency Trócaire launched its Christmas Appeal with an urgent call from Trócaire CEO Caoimhe de Barra for people in county Louth to support innocent families who are caught up in wars and conflicts around the world.
“Where Trócaire works, millions people have known nothing but war and have lived through constant conflict since they were born” according to Caoimhe.
“Trócaire is working to protect them and keep them safe. We are asking the public to support us and make sure these innocent people aren’t forgotten this Christmas.”
This Christmas marks the 50th anniversary of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s iconic War is Over ‘peace’ campaign. Trócaire has reimagined the campaign with a 2019 ‘War Is Over Christmas appeal’ supporting families who are living in war zones around the world.
According to Caoimhe from Trócaire, families fleeing conflict urgently need food, shelter and healthcare this Christmas in many of the countries where Trócaire works.
“Millions of children around the world have known nothing but conflict in their lives. Their lives are on hold because they are living in war zones. It seems that in many cases the world has forgotten these children. This Christmas we want them to know that we haven’t forgotten them,” she said.
“The figures are frightening” said Caoimhe. “In Syria, Somalia and Gaza alone, where Trócaire works, an estimated 19 million people have known nothing but war – children have lived in conflict zones since they were born.”
After 8 years of war 6.7m people (approximately half of the entire Syrian population) have been forced to leave their country. In Somalia there has been an ongoing conflict since 1991 and currently half of the population (6.2 million people) is experiencing severe food shortages with millions requiring life-saving assistance.
Meanwhile the Israeli- Palestinian conflict has resulted in close to 2 million people in Gaza (80% of the population) relying on humanitarian assistance to survive.
“Donating to Trócaire’s Christmas appeal will help people born into some of the longest-running conflicts in the world” said Caoimhe.
“We are grateful and thankful for the support we receive from the people of Louth each year. Their support directly impacts families and communities around the world and that is why it is so vital this Christmas.”
According to Trócaire, the agency will deliver food, shelter, medicine and protection to innocent people living in warzones around the world thanks to the donations it receives this Christmas. More information is available from www.trocaire.org or by calling 1850 408 408.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood heartthrobs Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapur and Abhishek Bachchan were seen partying together at an intimate dinner on Sunday night. Bunty Walia and Vanessa Parmar hosted the dinner for the boy gang. The boy gang is usually seen playing football together.
Abhishek Bachchan was seen in formal dressing, while Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur were seen sporting a casual look in pieces of denim and caps.
Ranbir took a selfie with Vanessa Parmar.
Ranbir's beau Alia Bhatt was seen missing in the party. Notably, she has worked with both Arjun Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur in movies, and is all set to pair up with Ranbir in 'Brahmastra'. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the movie is scheduled to hit the screens in Summer 2020. Ranbir and Alia have been seen together ever since the announcement of 'Brahmastra'.
'Brahmastra' also has Amitabh Bachchan, Dimple Kapadia, Nagarjuna Akkineni and Mouni Roy essaying key roles. Amitabh's recent uber-cool pictures from the shooting spot went viral on social media. Alia has signed her next film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, titled 'Gangubai Kathiawadi'. She will also be seen in Mahesh Bhatt's 'Sadak 2' and SS Rajamouli's 'RRR' along with Ajay Devgn. Alia will join hands with Aditya for 'Sadak 2'. Alia and Aditya will play lovers in the film, which will be directed by Mahesh Bhatt.
Meanwhile, Arjun Kapoor's 'Panipat' had hit the theatres last Friday and opened to mixed reviews. Certain sections of people have expressed their dissatisfaction over the portrayal of 'Maharaja Surajmal' in the film. Starring Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon in lead roles, the movie is about the events that happened during the Third Battle of Panipat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Winners of the Digital Sky Challenge announced</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS - The winners of the aviation challenge themed as Digital Sky Challenge1 were announced at the awards ceremony as part of the SESAR Innovation Days2 on 4 December in Athens.
Jointly organised by the SESAR JU and ACI Europe and hosted by Athens International Airport, the Digital Sky Challenge took place on 2-4 December in a dedicated airside facility of the airport. The event brought together 52 young tech-talents from 11 European countries competing in 12 teams to create breakthrough prototype solutions to address 3 different challenges: 1. Streamlining the passenger experience, 2. Improving the Environment, 3. Enhancing safety – with the support of several key partners3.
The teams pitched and demoed their solutions to a distinguished judging panel4 which selected the winning teams based on four criteria: level of innovation, business value, design and overall quality of the prototypes.
Passenger Experience Challenge: Innov’ATMThe winning team5 was Innov’ATM, who came up with an innovative app to reduce the stress of travelling while improving airline punctuality. The app helps to track passengers with their consent, so that airlines, airports and ATC know where they are. It offers clear benefits which are marketable and doable.
Safety Challenge: JBMThe winning team6 was JBM. With no prior aviation background, the winning team successfully developed from scratch a safety-net capable of analysing distances between aircraft in order to alert of and thus avert potential incidents.
Environment challenge: Eco-TravellersThe Environment challenge award7 went to Eco-Travellers. The team developed a tool that allows passengers to select the best and most green mobility option, integrating multiple modes of transport. The tool took into account existing systems and carbon offsetting schemes.
Special Recognition AwardsBoth Honeywell & Airbus selected the JBM team, who was also the winner of the Safety challenge. They were impressed by the novelty and usefulness of their separation management tool. Innaxis gave a special recognition to AerLabs for its AI-based solution that forecasts weather disruption in order to enable airlines to better access the probability of making flight cancellations.
The solutions that have been generated are now open for further development.
Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of SESAR JU concluded: “Congratulations to all the winning and participating teams in the Digital Sky Challenge - it was truly inspiring to see how much innovation could be achieved in only 48 hours! It clearly demonstrates the amazing talent pool that European aviation has at its disposal. Industry is already expressing an interest in the solutions so I am confident that this is not the end but the beginning of an exciting journey for our winners!”
Olivier Jankovec, Director General of ACI Europe said: “Hats off to the winners of the Digital Sky Challenge for delivering in just 48 hours truly innovative solutions that can help advance airport operations – with tangible benefits for passengers, the environment and safety. I have been truly impressed by the agility and creativity of Innov’ATM, JBM, Eco-Travellers and AerLabs. I hope their solutions will soon make their way into fully developed and marketed tools and wish them every success for the future.”
Dr. Yiannis Paraschis, CEO of Athens International Airport said: “Our highest respect to the winning teams of the Digital Sky Challenge. They gained the admiration of the jury, but they also attracted the interest and attention of highly important aviation stakeholders, with the degree of innovation, and overall quality of their solutions. We feel extremely proud that Athens International Airport was the first airport site to host the Digital Sky Challenge and indeed privileged to have been able to contribute to the “reinvention” of aviation, through this dynamic and innovative 48-hour “digital sprint” that united the aviation industry on our premises“.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Be a freewheeler! It's 50 years since Easy Rider, but the route the characters rode, from LA to New Orleans, still offers a unique insight into the soul of America</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The donkey has a sticker on his forehead that reads 'do not feed me anything'. 
Oatman mules look harmless enough but this old Arizona mining town on America's Route 66 is a rich seam of unlikely attractions for anyone on an epic road trip.
I've just arrived at Fast Fanny's store in Main Street where they offer everything from T-shirts to shotguns. It's the latest bizarre halt on my journey to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Easy Rider - one of Hollywood's most iconic road movies.
Oatman is a living ghost town that now thrives as an 'authentic Western experience'. It's also a Mecca for bikers. Easy Rider was a cult classic that turned lead actors Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper into the coolest superstars on the planet back in 1969 - their hippy-esque, free-wheeling film a box office sensation.
And inside Oatman's ramshackle motorcycle museum I've stumbled across a replica of Captain America - the film's famous chopper bike that came to represent the counter culture of Sixties America. It may be old but the chrome fittings still give off a rebellious sparkle.
Characters Wyatt and Billy rode their Harley-Davidsons almost 2,000 miles from Los Angeles to New Orleans in the movie. Their stash of money from an ill-fated drugs deal hidden in a fuel tank.
I've saddled up with photographer Richard Bradbury on two hired Harleys. Our week-long ride has been mapped out to follow some of the locations featured in the early part of the film.
Wyatt and Billy slept rough on their journey and got into all manner of scrapes. I'm looking for adventure but prefer more traditional accommodation - if only to ease the back pain of several days' hard riding.
Our trip started a week earlier, planning a route in the famous Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel. The upmarket restaurant is a favourite with the glitterati of Hollywood, and once a hide out for Hopper and Fonda, too. Our bikes have already been delivered to the nearby Waldorf Astoria usual form of hotel, where the transport is a limo.
The start point is Manhattan Beach, where leather-skinned locals vie for the best sunbathing.
It would be tempting to stay and soak up the Pacific breeze, but like Billy and Wyatt, we're on a journey. Soon our bikes are zooming north on Highway 14, past Palmdale and Lancaster to Mojave, near the gateway of Death Valley National Park.
The Oasis at Death Valley was once a tourist destination for wealthy Californians who wanted to experience the uniqueness of desert the desert, where temperatures have reached a record 56.7c.
The extreme climate means most travellers visit only in the winter. Death Valley was the location for many of the iconic scenes in Easy Rider, too. And with Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild soundtrack blasting through my helmet headphones, Bradbury and I are living the dream.
Cruising south again past 20 Mule Canyon and skirting the Nevada border, we stumble across the Amargosa Hotel. Back in the Sixties, the late Marta Becket created a fully operational opera house here, miles from anywhere. Lacking an audience, she hand-painted characters on the walls and often danced to an empty auditorium.
Three hours later we arrive at Café 247, where the T-shirt logo reads 'In The Middle of Nowhere'.
The classic roadside diner features walls smothered in oily automobilia from the golden age of American muscle cars. Outside, another replica of Captain America is fixed to the roof.
Further south again is upmarket Palm Springs, a playground for LA's rich and famous. Bradbury and I collapse on our beds at boutique hotel Villa Royale, with our fly-splattered bikes resting in the parking lot. There's a heated pool and a glitzy bar.
The next day we head east, past Joshua Tree National Park, the inspiration for U2's seminal album. Then it's north again to Needles, passing ghost towns such as Oatman that were left to crumble in the Dust Bowl of the Great Depression. Big skies and huge scenery just add to the drama.
Our final destination is the Pony Soldier Inn at Flagstaff - 200 miles further east on busy Interstate 40. Buffeted by lorries and trucks, we arrive at Wupatki National Monument and visit the Indian ruins where Billy and Wyatt famously camped for the night.
We've travelled more than 1,000 miles and met some interesting characters. Easy Rider may be 50 years old and less cool for the younger generation, but there's still time to get your motor runnin' and head out on the highway ...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cyn Santana Is Forced To Explain Why She Said Black Men Prefer Latinas Over Black Women</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyn Santana had some serious explaining and apologizing to do after making some rather bizarre comments about Black men preferring Latinas over Black women.
The controversy took place in 2016 when Joe Budden’s ex-fiancée sat down on Angela Yee’s Lip Service podcast, and she decided to share her thoughts on interracial dating.
The Love and Hip Hop: New York talent started off by talking about her own experiences with black men by saying this: “I just like Black guys and Spanish girls. Y’all can keep the Puerto Rican men, I’m good. I do Black guys all day, sorry. I did the Spanish thing… doesn’t work out for me. I think they’re too emotional.”
However, she went on to make the following shocking comments about the matter: “Black guys cater to us Spanish girls, especially. Like, they… you know what, let me not get into it. Black girls gonna take it personally. They gonna be like, ‘Uhh uhh!’ Anyway, I’m done with the papis.”
Needless to say, she was bashed by members of the Black community who slammed the curvy model, pushing her to issue an apology.
While on The Real, Cyn decided to clarify her controversial comments by saying: “I think what happened was, we were talking about our experiences with men and different men, races, and ethnicities and comparing our experiences. I think what happened was I poorly articulated myself and I irresponsibly repeated something that I heard my entire life.”
She added: “This is a tough moment for me. I feel like I poorly articulated myself, and I irresponsibly repeated something that I heard throughout my teenage years, which was the whole, ‘Oh, Black men love Spanish women or Latinas, you know.’ And I think people took that message wrongly. That’s not what I meant.”
The new explanation did not sit well with many, and Cyn issued a statement on social media to try to get out of the messy situation: “I especially love THE BLACK WOMAN. I’ve never in my life bashed one. Never will. So yeah, Ima explains myself and shed some clarity on a clip that’s being spread around with little context. I’ve used the N-word ignorantly most of my life, not knowing that it was actually a bad word, and it was offensive. Took that word out of my vocab… If I’ve offended anyone, I do indeed apologize.”
What are your thoughts on this drama?

Fikile Mbalula. Picture: GCIS
Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has announced that Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has been placed under administration.
At a press briefing, Mbalula also came to a decision to dissolve the interim Prasa board, a decision based on issues within Prasa.
This was informed by experience as the challenges were deep-rooted, he said, and replacing an interim board with a permanent one would not solve the problem.
Bongisizwe Mpondo has been appointed Prasa administrator with immediate effect while Mbalula is determined to stabilise the state-owned enterprise.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nell Gifford who co-founded Giffords Circus dies from breast cancer aged 46 - leaving behind nine-year-old twins</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Circus creator Nell Gifford has passed away at the age of 46 following a longstanding battle with breast cancer.   
Nell, who was originally from Wiltshire was surrounded by family 'both immediate and circus' when she died on Sunday December 8th.  
The mother of nine-year-old twins Cecil and Red was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, after finding a lump in her breast. 
Earlier this year was told she had just one year left to live as the disease had spread to her bones and lymph nodes.
In a statement, Gifford Circus said: 'We know many tears will be falling as Nell touched so many hearts. 
'Her vision for Giffords Circus was to bring happiness, imagination and enliven people’s souls. Giffords Circus shall continue to do just that. 
'Whilst the world is a dimmer place today, Nell will continue to live through the Circus.
'Nell was a creative genius, a daughter, step-daughter, sister, friend, leader and mother. 
'She leaves behind the next generation – her twins Cecil and Red – who are both part of the Giffords Circus DNA. We love her. May she rest in peace.'  
In 2020 Giffords Circus will celebrate their 20th anniversary of the Circus and say that Nell wanted it to be the 'showstopper'.   
Next year’s production, 'The Hooley' will celebrate the first 20 years, the next 20 years of the circus as well as Nell’s incredible life. 
The circus continued: 'Nell built a circus to last. It is poised to grow and fulfill Nell’s plans for the future.' 
The mother was transparent about her breast cancer battle, and earlier this year revealed she was honest about her cancer diagnosis with her children.
She previously told the Evening Standard: 'I hate secrets, they are corrosive. The more people are open about cancer the less scary it is.'
Nell was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, after finding a lump in her breast. She underwent three rounds of chemotherapy - losing her hair each time. 
Talking about her twins, who also star in her circus, she said: 'It's a lot for the children to take on. But if they didn't know they wouldn't be processing it, and they will have to sometime. We are doing it together.' 
Nell created Gifford Circus, which tours the south of England every summer, with her ex-husband Toti Gifford in 2000.
Her son Cecil and daughter Red, who go to school in Stroud, Gloucestershire, will presumably be left in the care of her former husband Toti.
The mother-of-two joined at New York State circus at 18 after her mother had an accident falling off a horse. 
Revealing to the Daily Mail previously, she wrote: 'I spent a month travelling New York State, painting the lorries and riding a horse in the parade.
'I saw a happy place where children and animals played together in the sunshine, and the workplace was a huge, candy-striped tent, full of music. It reminded me so much of my younger years.'
Three years later, after graduating from Oxford, she bought an old van and joined the first show that came to town. And for the next few years she worked for many different circuses.   
Writing for the Daily Mail about starting her own circus she said: 'Returning home in 1999, I wanted to breathe new life into the art of circus in Britain, and I shared my dream with a tall, curly-haired boy named Toti Gifford, a landscape gardener whom I’d met on a friend’s farm in Cheltenham between tours.
'We married that year and immediately started our own circus. 
'We had no equipment or backing - but we did have a deadline, after I persuaded the organisers of the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival that their line-up for May 2000 should include a booking for Gifford’s Circus, as we had decided it should be called.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Cape Town residents have been reminded to comment on a proposal to expand the areas subjected to paid street parking. 
In a statement on Sunday, Felicity Purchase, mayco member for transport, told residents that the deadline to submit their comments and suggestions on the proposal to expand managed parking to more areas across Cape Town is Friday.
Sub-councils, business owners, and residents from CBDs and popular recreational areas like Camps Bay and Muizenberg have requested the City to expand managed parking to these areas due to the rapid increase in demand for on-street parking.
Purchase said: “Managed parking means the City charges a tariff for the use of an on-street parking bay; that the tariff is determined by the time the bay is being occupied and that those who park in CBDs are charged per 15 minutes.
“Visitors to recreational areas will be charged per three hours; that time restrictions are applicable; and the management times are from 8am to 5pm on weekdays and 8am to 1pm on Saturdays,” said Purchase.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Useful tips and tricks to deal with load shedding | IOL News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - As South Africans brace for a dark festive season, experts have offered useful tips and tricks to help deal with ongoing load shedding.
On Monday morning, Eskom announced that the planned Stage 2 load shedding would move to stage 4 from 10am until 11pm due to additional loss of units at its power stations.
The entity also said the probability of load shedding remained high for the week as a result of a shortage of capacity.
To help deal with this, Budget Insurance has offered various ways consumers can cope with the ongoing power cuts, all while saving money and looking after the environment.
“Many South Africans are left scratching their heads on how to cope with high energy prices, as well as how to curb load shedding and its effects on their businesses and homes,” says Budget Insurance's Susan Steward.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Veteran actor Shatrughan Sinha turns a year older today. On his 73rd birthday, daughter Sonakshi Sinha dropped a cute birthday wish for him on her Instagram page.
The 'Dabangg 3' actress shared a picture, where she is seen twinning with her father in black and looking at him adorably while the birthday boy has his eyes on the camera. Sonakshi captioned this photo as, "Birthday boy," followed by a cake emoji.
Huma Qureshi dropped a birthday wish on Sonakshi's picture and wrote, "Happy bday uncle."
Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv Sinha too wished him with a throwback picture and wrote, "Happybirthday to my #Hero #Family #Happy #Memories #Star #Legend #Shotgun #Idol #Shatrughansinha #Best #Father #fatherandson #Throwback #Monday #toomanyhastags."
Speaking about her bond with her father, Sonakshi said in an old Rediff interview, "I have always been the apple of my father's eye. I am the most pampered person at home since I am the youngest. Also, because I am a girl. He is the best father that I could have asked for."
In yet another interview, when asked if she discusses work with him, the actress had said, '"I discuss some of my films with him, as and when we get the time. He doesn't really interfere in what roles or movies I choose. He watches my films as a father and is my biggest fan."
Last year, Sonakshi and Shatrughan Sinha shared a frame in Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se song 'Rafta Rafta'.
Talking about films, Sonakshi will next be seen in Salman Khan's 'Dabangg 3'. Explaining why 'Dabangg' is a special franchise for her, the actress told IANS, "Every time I enter the set of Dabangg, it is a special feeling. I started my journey 10 years ago with that film. It was my debut film opposite Salman Khan. My equation will never change with him no matter how many films I sign and what I achieve as an actress. He helped me to find my calling; I did not even know that I can act and I am an actress now."
Besides this movie, Sonakshi is also a part of Ajay Devgn's 'Bhuj: The Pride Of India' alongside Parineeti Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Rana Daggubati and Ammy Virk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonko no-show in Voi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At the Voi Law Court where Governor Mike Sonko was expected to take plea on Monday, there was nothing unusual.
Sessions at the Taita Taveta court went on while he appeared at the Milimani Law Court in Nairobi even as police sources indicated that the governor was expected in Voi to answer to assault charges.
Sources at the court also said they were expecting Sonko to appear and face charges of resisting arrest and assaulting Coast regional police commander Rashid Yakub.
There was also little activity at the Ikanga Airstrip in Voi, which was last Friday the scene of high drama when the county boss resisted arrest and refused to board a police helicopter meant to airlift him to Nairobi.
He was later subdued and airlifted to the capital, coming just hours after Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji called for his arrest that morning.
Sonko has since gone on to express unease with the manner in which he was arrested and locked up last week.
“In the last three months, I have been summoned by the EACC four times; I have faithfully honoured all the summons,” he said in a post on his official social media page.
“Question is, what was so difficult for Mr Noordin Haji or Mr Twalib Mbarak to follow the same process of summoning me to present myself at the EACC offices for processing and charging?” he wondered.
The police, however, maintain that Sonko was attempting escape when he was intercepted at the Ndara roadblock.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World chess champion Magnus Carlsen has climbed to an astonishing sixth place in the Premier League Fantasy Football rankings!
Carlsen has dominated the world of chess for around a decade now, but it seems he also flourishes in the world of fantasy football. 
The Norwegian's team, named Kjell Ankedal, has risen to sixth out of 7 million players worldwide after a gameweek where captaining Mohamed Salah against Bournemouth paid off with a 26-point return.  
Carlsen's team also featured standout weekend performers Heung-Son Min, who scored a wonderful solo goal against Burnley, and Jamie Vardy who scored for the eighth Premier League game running. 
The 29-year-old is a known lover of Premier League football, and is often seen kicking a ball about before chess tournaments worldwide. 
He is currently in London competing at the London Chess Classic at Olympia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flying along Kenyan coastline now risky</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The weatherman has issued a warning over flying along the coastline as heavy rains continue to pound several parts of the country.
For the next three days, Mombasa and other coastal counties will experience heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms.
Mr Edward Ngure, Mombasa's Director of Meteorology, told the Nation of cyclonic activities reducing pressure in the India Ocean, with most clouds moving towards the cyclone.
"Heavy rains will be accompanied by strong winds offshore, which may which may result in a storm surge in the ocean," said Mr Ngure.
AREAS AFFECTED
According to a weather update issued on Monday, the region will receive rains in the morning throughout the week, with sunny intervals and thunderstorms.
In Mombasa, areas expected to be affected are Nyali, Kisauni, Shanzu, Likoni, Mvita, Changamwe and Jomvu.
"[The rains are] going to affect areas in the entire coastline from Lamu to Kwame. The situation gets worse as you move south towards Madagascar," Mr Ngure said.
The weatherman also warned of flash floods in low lying areas and those with poor drainage systems, as well as in areas with unfilled quarries. He issued alerts to residents of Galana and Tana River.
Fishermen and beach goers were also warned about strong winds.
HOMELESS
By Monday morning, most parts of Mombasa were experiencing continuous rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms.
In Taita Taveta, the county government said it will support victims of rain-related calamities by relocating them to safer ground and reconstructing their houses.
More than 200 families have been left homeless by heavy rains that destroyed their houses.
Some of the families are camping at Voi Primary School as the government and well-wishers look into resettling them.
Governor Granton Samboja said the county will pay for the relocation but asked for help from the national government.
"As we continue to assess, my government will support affected families by relocating and reconstructing their homes," he said in Rong'e, without revealing whether funds had been set aside.
DAMAGE
Voi and Wundanyi sub-counties are most affected, with three deaths reported so far.
In Wundanyi, 41 houses have been destroyed by mudslides and roads rendered impassable. 
Well-wishers have provided the families with shelter amid calls by the government for the people to move to safer areas.
Leaders led by Mr Samboja and Wundanyi MP Danson Mwashako urged the national government to disburse funds to mitigate the damages.
"We need help fixing our roads because some of them are totally impassable," the governor said.
Public service operators are up in arms over the poor state of the roads while farmers say they cannot transport their produce to markets.
IMPOSTERS
Meanwhile, more than 120 people were expelled from the Voi camp after it was established that they were not flood victims.
Jaram Oranga, the county's coordinator of the Kenya Red Cross Society, said some people were taking advantage of the situation to get free food and shelter.
"We conducted investigations and realised they were not genuine flood victims," he said.
Mr Oranga said only 185 people were camping at the school.
"We don't know when we will close the camp. It is the responsibility of the county government to resettle them," he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Equity benchmark BSE Sensex on Monday fell over 70 points in early trade, dragged mainly by losses in financial and banking stocks amid persistent foreign fund outflows.
The 30-share index was trading 73.38 points or 0.18 per cent lower at 40,371.77 in morning trade; while the broader Nifty was trading 26.10 points or 0.22 per cent down at 11,895.40.
In the previous session, Sensex settled at 40,445.15, down 334.44 points or 0.82 per cent. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty shed 96.90 points or 0.81 per cent to close at 11,921.50.
Bajaj Finance was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack with a decline by 1.28 per cent in morning deals, followed by HUL, ITC, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Axis Bank.
On the other hand, Maruti, Vedanta, Tata Steel, HDFC, Tata Motors and Sun Pharma emerged as the gainers, rising up to 1.72 per cent.
Meanwhile, the rupee appreciated by 10 paise to 71.10 in early session on Monday.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) offloaded shares worth Rs 867.66 crore in the capital market on Friday, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares to the tune of Rs 210.72 crore, data available with the stock exchange showed.
Asian stocks were trading mostly higher on Monday following strong US job data amid weak Chinese exports.
American employers added 266,000 jobs in November, according to the Labor Department data released on Friday.
Marking the fourth straight fall, Chinese exports declined 1.1 in November compared to the same month a year earlier, mainly dragged by weaker shipments to the US that fell 23 per cent.
Brent futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.33 per cent to USD 64.18 per barrel.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Civic Renewal Party (CRP), which is affiliated to Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, has called on the Ministry of Education to consider writing off all loans owed to the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) by graduates who are not employed.
According to the party, which has written to the ministry over the matter, the prevailing difficult situation in the country among the youth should inform the ministry to cancel all the debts, just like the national government has waived debt for coffee and other sectors.
CRP official James Mwangi said Helb should also stop charging interest on the student loans going forward.
YOUTH HOPELESS
“We appeal to CS George Magoha to cancel all student loan debt for hundreds of thousands of unemployed graduates who owe billions of shillings (to Helb) and place a cap on student loan interest rates going forward at zero rates. This is because of the prevailing environment in the country which has made most of the youth hopeless and increased cases of suicides in the country,” Mr Mwangi said.
He said the party has written to education officials seeking for the waiver and recommending for huge investments in the higher education sector just the way other government departments are heavily funded.
CHRISTMAS GIFT
“We encourage high investment in the education sector especially on higher education.
“This will be the biggest Christmas gift President Uhuru Kenyatta can give unemployed graduates in Kenya who have lost hope due to hard economic times,” Mr Mwangi told the Nation.
The party has cautioned Helb not to publish information on loan defaulters as the board threatened last month, saying doing so will contravene the privacy of the debtors as enshrined in the Constitution and the recently enacted Data Protection Act, 2019.
“We shall not allow Helb to flout the constitutional regulations on giving out private information to the public. Instead, state agencies should advocate for free tuition and debt-free public colleges and universities,” Mr Mwangi noted.
HELB NOTICE
Last month, Helb issued a 30-day notice saying on its expiry it would publish the names of defaulters.
“Please take note that names and photos of loan beneficiaries who have defaulted repayment of the loans from 1975 will be published in the leading newspapers after expiry of 30 days from the date of this notice,” read the Helb notice.
After the 30 days, it added that it will proceed to take legal actions against the defaulters.
According to Helb, more than 80,000 Kenyans have failed to remit a total of a Sh50 billion in loan repayments.
Defaulters are slapped with a Sh5,000 monthly penalty according to Helb policy.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karnataka bypoll results: 'I will give a good administration in the next three-and-half years with the help of our ministers and MLAs,' an upbeat Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru
Celebrating BJP's good performance in the bypolls in Karnataka, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa today said he would ensure a stable and pro-development government for the next three-and-half years - the remainder of his term.
"Voters have given their verdict and the results are out. Now we have to focus on the development of the state. I will give a good administration in the next three-and-half years with the help of our ministers and MLAs," an upbeat Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru.
He sought the support of the opposition to complete his term unhindered.
"The opposition has been trying to create confusion among people. I appeal to them that at least from now on give us their complete support," Yediyurappa said.
"We had given assurance to all the disqualified (Congress-JDS) MLAs that they will be made ministers. So there is no question of backtracking from what we promised them. We will make them ministers and give them responsibility to grow our party base in their area," he said.
The BJP fielded 13 disqualified MLAs in the by-election held on December 5 in 15 constituencies. The party is leading in 12 seats, the Congress in two seats and an independent in one seat.

Middendorp compared his experienced defenders to teenage youngsters who are still cutting their teeth in the junior ranks.
“Entertaining game, I think the number of goals is good for supporters, there’s no doubt about it. First half I think we had a huge attitude issue, not really in the game, we didn’t want to move like we should, could be,” Middendorp told SuperSport TV.
“Like we have done to get this position we’re in at the moment. Much better in the second-half, I think in the end fully deserved three points for us and it’s good for us.
“I would not say it’s under-12, then I would insult the under-12 defensive work. I don’t know what’s below, if there’s an under-8 or an under-17, mean really, national team players and there’s nothing to blame, as I said it’s not the quality, it’s just the attitude,” said the 61-year-old.
“Where we’re sitting now we think we can do less, we cannot. We have to fight each and every team first on the ground and then we can score and celebrate. But if you go into a game and you want to just do a little bit of a Prima donna, there’s no chance to win a game in this league.”
Chiefs next face Maritzburg United away in their last league game of 2019. The game is set to be played at Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday, December 22.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kartik Aaryan is in a happy place as both his work and love life are in the headlines! In his recent tête-à-tête with Times Now, when Kartik was quizzed if he has been attracted to someone else while being in a relationship, the actor gave a rather startling reply and said, "Yes."
He said, "Yes, I have! Emotional cheating should never be the case. Physical cheating too shouldn't be the case. But emotional is worse. So in attraction, it isn't cheating because you feel she's cute then it's okay. It's better if it doesn't go beyond that."
Kartik's co-star Ananya Panday also nodded along with his reply and said that one can find someone else cute and that's not 'cheating'.
Meanwhile, both Kartik and Ananya have been getting rave reviews for their latest release - Pati Patni Aur Woh, which also casts Bhumi Pednekar in the lead role. From film critics to moviegoers, everyone is impressed with their work in the film and Kartik is all set to bag one more hit in his kitty.
Kartik will next be seen in Imtiaz Ali's upcoming directorial, tentatively called 'Aaj Kal'. The film also casts Kartik's rumoured girlfriend, Sara Ali Khan and is all set to hit the theatres on February 14, 2020.
Ananya, on the other hand, will next be seen in Khaali Peeli, which marks her third outing after Student of the Year 2 and Pati Patni Aur Woh. She is paired opposite Ishaan Khatter in the film and fans are quite excited to see them together on the silver screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Include Shia Muslims in Citizenship Amendment Bill, Shia Central Waqf Board urges Centre</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Shia Central Waqf Board on Monday urged the Centre to include Shia Muslims in the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, The Hindu reported.
The board said that Shias were subjected to “inhuman acts” in Sunni Muslims-dominated countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. “They are being killed for being Shia,” the board’s chairman Waseem Rizvi said.
Since Shias were a “rare section” of Muslims, they must be protected from “persecution and excesses”, he said. “Shia community has been persecuted continuously for nearly 1,400 years by Muslim majoritarian Sunni society and continue to be.” He also praised the bill and said that it was an example of India’s humanity.
The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, proposes an amendment to a 1955 law to provide citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians from the Muslim-majority nations of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. If passed, it will grant citizenship to persecuted people from these communities, provided they have resided in India for six years. The cut-off date is December 31, 2014.
“We are a minority within the minorities in India… If you are taking Buddhists, Jains, Christians under the ambit of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, then you must include Shias as well,” said All India Shia Personal Law Board spokesperson Maulana Yasoob Abbas on Sunday, according to The Indian Express.
The board passed a resolution on Sunday urging the Centre to include Shia Muslims in the bill. “The AISPLB demands that Shia Muslims should be given Indian citizenship because the Indian Constitution views all religions with an equal view,” the resolution said.
On Monday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the controversial bill in the Lok Sabha amid protests from Opposition parties. While the Opposition parties alleged that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminated against Muslims, Amit Shah defended the bill and claimed that it was not at all discriminatory.
He claimed that Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians were ill-treated in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, which state in their Constitution that Islam is their law of land. “So this bill will give these persecuted people citizenship,” Shah said. “If from these three countries, any Muslim petitions for citizenship, we will consider with an open mind but they will not get the benefit of this bill as the [Muslims] wouldn’t have been persecuted.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rajan pointed out that extreme centralisation, coupled with lack of empowered ministers and a coherent guiding vision meant reforms picked up steam only when PMO focused on them and lost pace when its attention switched to other pressing issues
Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said the centralised nature of current Modi government doesn't work well in carrying out of economic reforms. In his article 'How to fix the economy' for India Today magazine, the noted economist pointed that this form of governance might work well for the political and social agenda of the party, but does not do well with economic reforms.
"Not just decision-making but also ideas and plans emanate from a small set of personalities around the Prime Minister and in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). That works well for the party's political and social agenda, which is well laid out, and where all these individuals have domain expertise. It works less well for economic reforms, where there is less of a coherent articulated agenda at the top and less domain knowledge of how the economy works at the national rather than state level," Rajan wrote.

Rajan said that Modi government's promise of 'minimum government, maximum governance' is often misunderstood. "What was meant was that government would do things more efficiently, not that people and the private sector would be freed to do more. While the government continues the creditable drive to automation-direct benefits transfer to recipients is an important achievement-the role of the government in many spheres has expanded, not shrunk," he added.
Rajan pointed out that extreme centralisation, coupled with lack of empowered ministers and a coherent guiding vision meant reforms picked up steam only when PMO focused on them and lost pace when its attention switched to other pressing issues.

"Often, these efforts take the form of grand gestures because the problems are large and require significant response-so we get demonetisation, bank mergers, corporate tax cuts... However, such episodic moves are not necessarily well-timed or synchronised towards a larger vision, so any associated economic benefits are diluted. Moreover, the follow-up to deal with the unintended consequences is inadequate since the line ministries are disempowered," he added.
Among remedies for the economic slowdown, Rajan suggested that decentralisation is critical for economic growth. He said that while the Centre has to give direction and political impetus to reforms, it cannot hold on to every rein.
"It has to start by empowering its own ministers, and also engage the states since many of the actions need state support," Rajan said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Human skull and skeleton dredged up from the depths of the Thames 'belonged to convict thrown overboard from 18th century prison ship'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A human skull and partial skeleton dredged up from the murky depths of the River Thames is thought to be a convict thrown overboard from an 18th century prison ship.
The remains are now to be studied by leading forensics experts in Australia in the hope of finding out why the person came to be buried in a shallow grave next to mudflats in the Thames Estuary.
They have been dated between 200 and 300 years old and were discovered in an area where prison hulks would moor before setting off for Australian penal colonies.
Mudlarking expert Lara Maiklem stumbled across the gruesome find in summer after seeing the top of a skull poking through stones.
Ms Maiklem, known as the London Mudlark for her hobby of scavenging the water's edge for interesting finds, then discovered leg and arm bones nearby.
She is convinced the bones belonged to a convict who became ill on a prison ship and whose body was hastily disposed of in the riverside mud.
She says similar finds are now becoming more common as the London water level rises and begins to wash away old burial places.
Ms Maiklem, 48, who documents her finds on her London Mudlark social media accounts, gathered up the bones and marked the spot using GPS before informing the police, the Museum of London and the local finds liaison officer.
The bones were taken to a police forensics lab in Scotland where they were dated.
It is thought the body may be one of hundreds of people buried alongside the Thames foreshore after they became ill on prison ships.
Many were simply slung over the side and hastily buried so as not to make others onboard sick. 
Now, a university expert in Australia wants to study the remnants to see if she can shed further light on who they might belong to.
Dr Paola Magni is a senior lecturer in forensic science at Murdoch University in Perth and specialises in the study of barnacles on bones.
She said the university was 'very excited' to receive the bones.
Dr Magni said: 'Back in June I travelled to the UK to present my research about barnacles and suddenly Lara's discovery - a skull covered by barnacles - popped up on my social media.
'I thought 'this is a sign!' It is a very interesting case for me. 
'I contacted Lara via social media to explain my work and the prospective research that could be done on the skull.
'It looks like this possibility is becoming a reality.'
The research will be headed by the Western Australia Museum and will also include museum director and barnacle expert Diana Jones, forensic pathologist and facial reconstructor Edda Guareschi and oceanographer Dr Jennifer Verduin.
Dr Verduin has been brought in to try and find out how the skull came to its geographical location as barnacles are usually seawater creatures.
Dr Magni added: 'A multidisciplinary investigation like this is extremely rare and is a great opportunity for forensic science education.
'Overall we would like to give a face to this person and reconstruct his story, from the cause of death, the place of death and the movements of the remains during the years. The evidence left by nature will give us the evidence to solve this mystery.'
A forensic artist is also to try and recreate the dead man's face to allow historians a look back in time at who he or she may have been.
Ms Maiklem, who lives on the Kent coast and has published several books on her hobby, said she was pleased so much research was being done to try and find out more about her Thames skull.
'This person deserved more than they got,' she said.
'They could have been on a prison hulk for something as minor as stealing a loaf of bread to feed their family, the things they transported them for were so minor.
'I think this person deserves more than being put into an industrial incinerator.'
Ms Maiklem was in the Thames Estuary when the tide was out and was walking back over mud flaps with a friend when the skull caught their eye.
She said: 'It was down in a little hollow.
'The river often doesn't move things very far. The law is that we have to tell police when we suspect we have discovered human remains.
The islands in Kent, owned by Natural England, were used as a mass burial ground for criminals who died on prison ships in the 1800s.
Coastal erosion began to expose the remains in 2017, with dozens of coffins and bodies uncovered by waters.
Experts say more than 1,000 men and boys were incarcerated in floating fortresses 'Retribution' and 'Bellerophon' anchored at Sheerness, made of decommissioned Ships of the Line stripped of their masts and sails.  
Naval historian Professor Eric Grove said: 'Obviously when people died on board these prison hulks they had to be buried somewhere and island close-by was the obvious place.'
There has been debate about how bad the conditions were on board, but it is believed a cholera outbreak on Retribution on the 1830s may help explain the dozens of bodies now littering the island.  
Transportation of convict ships from Britain and Ireland to Australia officially ended in 1868.
Professor Groves added: 'There were a lot of men in close quarters, and if an epidemic began it spread quickly.'
'We gathered up what we could find together, dug a shallow pit and put a stake in the ground and took a GPS reading.
'Police went and gathered them during the next tide.'
She added: 'The skull was covered in barnacles and it was obvious to me that it was quite old, but the police had to come anyway. They told me they had an ongoing case in the area.
'It's highly likely that this skeleton has come from a prison ship moored in the area, often they were moored on the marshes around Woolwich and housed Napoleonic prisoners of war.
'These ships were just dreadful. As soon as there was any sign of disease onboard it would have spread like wildfire.
'When they died they just buried them on the nearest patch of land.
'River levels have risen by a foot so it's starting to erode these areas where they buried people.'
Prison hulks were decommissioned warships, stripped of their masts, rigging and sails and used to house those convicted of both serious and minor crimes.
They were moored up along the Thames and Medway estuaries, as well as at Portsmouth, Bermuda and Gibraltar where prisoners were put to work in the dockyards.
They often held criminals awaiting transportation to penal colonies in Australia.
In 1798 the hulks held more than 1,400 out of about 1,900 people waiting for transportation to Australia.
The Thames skull is currently at Kent Police Headquarters in Maidstone, Kent, and is soon to be signed over to Dr Magni.
Ms Maiklem added: 'We may finally get to look into the face of this man and if he was awaiting transportation he may finally make it to Australia after all.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After contributing 12 goals and numerous assists in 51 Premier League appearances for the Foxes, the 23-year-old has been linked with a future transfer to another top-flight club.
Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are all said to hold an interest in the playmaker, who recently made his international debut with England.
However, according to talkSPORT, Maddison is ready to sign a new long-term contract with the East Midlands outfit in the near future.
While Maddison still has over three-and-a-half years left on his existing deal, Leicester are seemingly ready to reward the former Norwich City man for his recent impressive form.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Publish charges against ex-bank chiefs, Diezani, CSOs tell EFCC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Agency Reporter
 
A coalition of society organisations has urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to publish the criminal charges against a former Petroleum Minister Diezani Allison – Madueke and other persons indicted for money laundering.
Others indicted are former NNPC and commercial banks officials Ben Otti, Nnamdi Okonkwo, Stanley Lawson, Lanre Adesanya and Dauda Lawal.
The Northern Youths in Defence of Democracy and Justice (NYDDJ) disclosed this in a statement signed by its convener Abba Suleiman after an emergency meeting in Abuja on Sunday.
EFCC spokesperson Wilson Uwajuren recently denied in a statement that the commission had dropped the criminal charge against Diezani and others.
He said the EFCC took a prosecutorial decision to split the initial 14-count charge to enable separate arraignment of the defendants.
The CSOs, however, said if the charges are still in place, the anti-graft agency should be bold enough to publish the charge sheet.
The EFCC, according to the civil society groups, labored to justify why it withdrew charges against all the accused persons and retained only Mr. Lawal, as the sole accused person. “The EFCC is trying to counteract a court process with a verbal press statement,” they said.
The statement said withdrawing charges against Diezani and others while retaining that of Mr Lawal is counter-productive to the anti-graft war of President Muhammadu Buhari.
“Witch-hunting, selective prosecution, cherry-picking accused persons and preferential treatment of suspects, will only further confirm the widely held view that EFCC has derailed from its initial mandate,” the civil societies said.
The statement reads: “We stand with the reports that the charges against Diezani and Otti have been withdrawn, as is clearly shown on the face of the charge sheet which bears only Lawal’s name.
“We challenge EFCC to publish the charges and controvert what we have said here. If EFCC claims that the charges against Diezani, Lawson, Adesanya, and Otti are still in place, we ask them to show us the charge sheet.
“Our advice to EFCC is that they should retrace their steps and revert to the spirit of the EFFC (Establishment) Act, where the organisation was envisaged to be one that will be run devoid of sentiments and personal considerations in fighting financial crime.“
The CSOs advice the commission to preserve its credibility locally and internationally, adding that “the fight against corruption will be greatly compromised if it proceeds with the withdrawal of corruption charges against suspected perpetrators of one the monumental corruption cases in Nigeria’s history.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">airBaltic receives the Regional Airline of the Year Award by CAPA</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Latvian airline airBaltic received the CAPA Regional Airline of the Year award in a special ceremony in Malta on December 5, 2019. For the second time, airBaltic has been recognised as the leader of the regional aviation sector by CAPA's Aviation Awards for Excellence which is held annually since 2003 with professionals participating from airlines around the world.
Martin Gauss, Chief Executive Officer of airBaltic said: “We at airBaltic have had yet another year of intense work and successful growth. We have continued developing our services, modernising the fleet and widening the route network for better connectivity. More passengers appreciate our product and choose airBaltic as their carrier. As a result, our total market share in the Baltics this year has reached 37%, ranking airBaltic the No 1 airline in Latvia and Estonia with 60% and 21% of market share respectively. The CAPA Regional Airline of the Year award is a great honour and an excellent motivation for our team to follow the course of constant improvement and growth.”
CAPA Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said: “airBaltic combines an LCC cost base with a compelling business class product, while its route network meshes point to point demand with a hub and spoke model. Its growth and return to profit, built on a strong market share in its home market of Latvia and the wider Baltic region, should certainly attract investor interest.”
airBaltic has been among the fastest growing airlines in Northern Europe, reaching double digit passenger growth each month for more than three years running. The airline has significantly developed its route network from 16 destinations in 2002 to 70+ today spanning Europe, Scandinavia, the CIS and the Middle East. In 2018, airBaltic carried four million passengers and by the end of this year the airline is expecting to carry five million passengers.
airBaltic holds a leading position in the Baltic region, being the market leader at Riga International Airport by record high market share and an established presence at Vilnius and Tallinn airports with a competitive cost structure. According to a recent study by business strategy consultants Roland Berger, airBaltic directly and indirectly contributed 2.5% to Latvia’s GDP in 2018 and supported close to 30 000 jobs.
The strong performance of the airline enabled airBaltic to become the first airline in Central and Eastern Europe to access the international debt capital markets with a Eurobond offering. In July 2019, airBaltic successfully issued EUR 200 million five-year bonds which will be used to strengthen company’s liquidity and continue investments into fleet. Investors have clearly shown that they see airBaltic's strategy as mature and strong. airBaltic regards all these achievements as good preconditions for an eventual IPO in the coming years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAPS’s top management seeks to remind the public that while the festive season exudes joy and excitement, this period also breeds sophisticated criminals armed with the latest scams and technology to extort hard-earned money.Mindful of this, the police compiled safety tips to ensure that citizens are ahead of criminals.
These safety tips are aimed at contributing to the safety and security of people during the holiday season.Shopping:· Shop during daylight hours if it is possible. If you must shop at night, ensure that a friend or family member accompanies you.· Avoid wearing expensive jewellery.· Do not carry a purse or wallet in your hand, if possible.· Always carry your driver’s licence or identification card along with the necessary cash, cheques or a credit card at all times.· Even though you are in a rush and thinking about a thousand things, be aware of your surroundings.· Avoid carrying large amounts of cash.· Pay for purchases with a cheque or credit card, if it is possible.· Keep cash in your front pocket.· Notify the credit card issuer immediately if your credit card is lost, stolen or misused.· Keep a record of all of your credit card numbers in a safe place at home.· Be extra careful if you carry a wallet or purse. They are the prime targets of criminals in crowded shopping areas, transportation terminals, bus stops, on buses and other rapid transit.· Avoid overloading yourself with packages. It is important to have clear visibility and freedom of motion to avoid mishaps.· Beware of strangers approaching you for any reason. At this time of year, con artists may try various methods of distracting you with the intention of taking your money or belongings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Perth and Kinross Matters: Volunteers deserve praise for trying to make Christmas special</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Jólasveinar descend from the mountains to wreak havoc in towns and villages, starting with Stekkjastaur on December 12 who is apparently as stiff as wood and preys on farmers’ sheep.
Twelve others follow, such as Bjúgnakrækir the sausage swiper and Gluggagægir the window peeper.
Don’t worry kids, they don’t bother people living in Scotland – which is probably just as well, because the troll problems here seem to be a lot more serious.
This week for example, trolls nearly put the kibosh on a Perthshire town’s winter display.
Volunteers in Rattray said there would be no Christmas tree this year, partly because of logistical problems transporting the giant fir, but also because they were fed-up with “disheartening” comments on social media.
Critics complained about the state of last year’s tree, and even said it looked like it had been decorated by drunks from the local pub.
Thankfully, a surge in support online has prompted a change of heart and steps are being taken to arrange for a new tree beside the parish church (in the meantime, a smaller one has been put in place by kind locals).
This has been a sad example of how online trolls – or rather normal folk thundering out their opinions on Facebook – can have real life consequences.
Who can blame the volunteers for threatening to pull the plug on the display, if all they get for their hard work, including months of fundraising and paperwork, is disparaging comments.
The truth is last year’s tree was perfectly fine, and certainly better than none at all.
The volunteers who make sure our towns and villages don’t go without Christmas sparkle deserve our praise, not snarky criticism.
Remember, these groups give up their own time to brightening up communities during the darkest weeks of the year. We need to stick up for them and support them when we can.
As a once-great man once said: “It’s so easy to laugh, it’s so easy to hate, it takes guts to be gentle and kind.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Kusi Ideas Festival is being hosted in the outskirts of Kigali at the Intare Conference Arena, one of the country’s modern conference facilities.
The facility was built to spur Rwanda's meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE) segment and is located in Rusororo, a growing suburb on a hill envisages the pace of the country's rapid economic growth.
Not so long ago, the suburb was mostly a semi-urban area but is now brewing with construction activity, as Rwanda moves to expand growth beyond the capital.
The arena was inaugurated in June 2017 and is wholly owned by the country's ruling party - RPF - said to be built solely from party members' contributions.
The Intare Conference Arena is capable of hosting meetings and events of various sizes in equal comfort, and has held several in the past, with its main competitor now being the Kigali Convention Centre.
The conference arena is built with a futuristic design including a curved dome steel that enhances retention of sound inside.
The main auditorium boasts a capacity of up to 2,500 people seated and 3,600 standing, with enhanced PA systems and high speed 4G wireless internet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aspire Mining signs MoU on Ovoot coking coal project in Mongolia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Metallurgical coal project developer Aspire Mining has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sinosteel Equipment & Engineering (Sinosteel MECC) to develop Mongolia’s Ovoot coking coal project.
The non-binding agreement covers potential engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) as well as trade-based funding opportunities for the Ovoot Early Development Project (OEDP).
Aspire Mining’s MoU comes after the company completed a $33.5m placement with shareholder Tserenpuntsag Tserendamba earlier this month, increasing the latter’s stake in the company from 27.5% to 51%.
The pre-feasibility study (PFS) of the OEDP includes construction of a five million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP) at the Ovoot mine site. The construction cost of the CHPP is estimated at $37m.
Under the MoU with Sinosteel, Aspire Mining is required to share information on the mine development pertaining to permitting and licenses, transport logistics and project financing.
Meanwhile, the company will also be allowed to access Sinosteel’s Coal Trading Platform, through which coal can be sold on a spot basis in China.
Aspire Mining executive chairman David Paull said: “Aspire recognises the importance of having a strong partnership with companies like Sinosteel MECC that play such a major role in the Chinese steel industry, the main market for Ovoot’s high-quality coking coal product.
“We look forward to working alongside Sinosteel MECC as one of our key partners in bringing the Ovoot Early Development Project into production and delivering value for all shareholders.”
The company expects to complete a definitive feasibility study (DFS) around May next year, subject to receiving the necessary permits and approvals to complete drilling of the mine.
If financing is secured and all permits are received by the first quarter of next year, Aspire Mining expects to begin pre-stripping of waste at Ovoot from the third quarter of the same year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Andrew Scott made priests hot during his sensual role as a cleric in hit-TV show Fleabag earlier this year.
And now a real-life vicar has amassed more than 100,000 Instagram followers - apparently due to his good looks.
Rev Christopher Lee, 36, from west London, posts '60-second sermons' to his 116,500 fans.
Scroll for video
The married father of two daughters is adamant they follow him for the power of the gospels and not due to his appearance.
Yet barrels of female followers post comments such as 'I love you' and 'you just keep blowing my mind' as well as putting numerous love heart emojis under his pictures.
He told the Times: 'It's never a horrible thing to be told you're good-looking, but I think most people follow me because of my content, because I speak to them on a deeper level.'
Rev Lee, who has been vicar at St Saviour's Church for four years, added: 'We get people every week saying they found us on Instagram.'
But he finds the comparisons to Scott's character embarrassing and thinks it is just due to his age.
He told iNews last month: 'Priests traditionally are a little bit heavy, a little bit old and a little bit distant, and I am, I think, none of those things.'
Scott's character was introduced in the second series of the show after he was brought in to officiate Fleabag's father and his second wife's wedding - and sparks immediately flew between the two of them.
The sequel series ended with Fleabag and the Priest going their separate ways during a tearful goodbye at a bus stop.
When Rev Lee was 21, he was working in business and had a house and a mortgage.
But he decided to teach English in Tanzania and armed himself with a Bible as his main tool.
After becoming engaged by his reading about God, he did a distance-learning degree to make him a priest.
Aged 24 he was ordained a deacon in the diocese of Mount Kilimanjaro.
The Church of England is trying to bolster its presence online and will today launch an app for Google Home smart speaker.
The app will allow users to ask the device to say grace before meals as well as pray before bed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Ghost ship' of Sutton Hoo to sail again: Anglo-Saxon vessel found in Suffolk 80 years ago will be rebuilt from 3D computer models to explore the origins of English seafaring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Anglo-Saxon vessel found in the Sutton Hoo burial mound in Suffolk 80 years ago will sail again as experts look to rebuild the ship from digital 3D models.
Dated back to the early 7th century, the 90 foot (27 metre) -long vessel is oft dubbed a 'ghost ship' thanks to its manner of preservation.
In the mound — thought the resting place of King Rædwald — only the impression of the ship and its iron rivets remained, the timber having long rotted away.
Nevertheless, a team of archaeologists and shipbuilders have succeeded in creating a three-dimensional digital mock-up of the vessel to allow it to be reconstructed.
Expert hope that recreating a full-size, fully-operational version of the ship will help shine light on how the Anglo-Saxons began England's tradition of seafaring. 
The vessel is hoped to take its first voyage across the seas in 2022.
Located near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Sutton Hoo is home to two burial mounds from the 6th and 7th centuries — the latter a ship burial.
The undisturbed burial site is believed to have been the resting place of King Rædwald of East Anglia.
The vessel is oft dubbed a a 'ghost ship' thanks to how only its iron rivets and impressions of timber remained.
Within the ship, however, archaeologists in 1939 found a ceremonial helmet, a shield, a sword, pieces of silver plate from the Byzantine Empire and metalwork fittings made of gold and gems. 
The Sutton Hoo artefacts are now housed in the collections of the British Museum, London, while the mound site is in the care of the National Trust.
'We suspect that seafaring was rooted in the hearts of the Angles and Saxons that made England their home. But we know little about it,' Sutton Hoo Ship's Company director Martin Carver told the Times.
'We want to see what a ship and its crew could do. Some things can be learnt from a book or a test tube; other things need learning by doing.'
'Our objectives are to learn how an early English ship was built, its performance in river, lake and sea, its handling of the wind and tides — and not only to learn what’s possible and record it, but to discover what it feels like.'
'So our project will contribute to knowledge of our shores and seas and knowledge of the earliest English, their history, way of life, their poetry.'
Work on the vessel will begin in earnest next month when volunteers will complete the frame onto which the ship's keel will be constructed.
Historical experts are working to ensure that the craft is constructed using authentic Anglo-Saxon building techniques and appropriate building materials for the time. 
This will include the joining of oak planks in the overlapping — or 'clinker' — style.
It is expected that the complete build will cost around £1 million ($1.3 million).
The shipbuilders believe that the replica could be completed and ready to brave the seas as soon as 2022, with potential test sailings across the North Sea and beyond. 
Experts believe that the original ship may also have sailed the seas — and been used for trading and warfare — before being hauled overland to play its role in the burial. 
Within the ship, archaeologists found various treasures from across both the British Isles as well as the Byzantine (eastern Roman) and Frankish (western European) empires — including the famed Sutton Hoo helmet. 
The grave itself is thought to belong to King Rædwald of East Anglia, a member of the Wuffingas dynasty which has been associated with the Wulfing clan of Sweden, who appeared in the Old English epic poem Beowulf.
Archaeologists believe that ship burials were likely intended to take the departed on their voyage into the afterlife. 
King Rædwald is notable for posthumously engaging in this practice and other pagan traditions despite having received the Christian sacraments.
'On his return home, he was seduced by his wife and certain perverse teachers, and turned aside from the sincerity of the faith,' wrote  historian and monk Saint Bede the Venerable in around the year 731.
'Like the Samaritans of old, he seemed at the same time to serve Christ and the gods whom he served before; and in the same temple he had an altar for the Christian Sacrifice, and another small one at which to offer victims to devils.'
King Rædwald was an Anglo-Saxon monarch who ruled the kingdom of East Anglia — what is today the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.
His reign is believed to have lasted from 599–624 AD, at which point he was placed in a ship burial at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk.
Rædwald was the first king of the East Angles to convert to Christianity, although he continued to practice pagan rites — reportedly maintaining a pagan alter alongside his Christian one — until his death.
He was a member of the Wuffingas dynasty which has been associated with the Wulfing clan of Sweden, who appeared in the Old English epic poem Beowulf. 
The ship was unearthed from its burial mound near Woodbridge in 1939 by a team of archaeologists led by one Basil Brown.
It is from the rivets and impressions of timber beams that had long-rotted-away that researchers from Southampton University have managed to digitally model the ship.
'Although that doesn’t sound like much evidence, it is enough to give us a virtually complete hull shape from keel to gunwale [the top edge of the hull on either side],' Southampton's maritime archaeologist Julian Whitewright told the Times.
This, he added, 'comprises the runs of the planking, the internal frame locations and general dimensions, the curvature of the keel and ends of the ship.'
'This is far more than most archaeological reconstructions have.'
For those interested in getting involved with the build, the Sutton Hoo Ship's Company is seeking green-oak timber woodworkers — ideally with traditional boat-building experience — along with data cataloguers and project photographers.
In addition, members of the public can, for £20 (around $26) sponsor one of the 3,598 iron rivets needed to construct the vessel's hull. 
Each sponsor will receive a commemorative pin badge and ownership card — with a unique number that will help them locate their rivet in the finished vessel.
