    <h5 class="mb-1">‘The Ferrante Effect’: In Italy, Women Writers Are Ascendant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ROME — In Italy, literary fiction has long been considered a man’s game. Publishers, critics and prize committees have dismissed books by women as chick lit and beach reads. They scoffed at Elena Ferrante, the author of “My Brilliant Friend,” as the writer of mere page-turners.
Then Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels became an international sensation, selling over 11 million copies, inspiring an acclaimed HBO series and cementing her reputation as the most successful Italian novelist in years. Her ascent, and the rediscovery of some of the last century’s great Italian female writers, has encouraged a new wave of women and shaken the country’s literary establishment. Women writers here are winning prestigious prizes, getting translated and selling copies.
Their achievements have set off a wider debate in Italy about what constitutes literature in a country where self-referential virtuosity is often valued over storytelling, emotional resonance and issues like sexism or gender roles.
“Once we were more reluctant to write about certain topics, fearing they could be labeled as ‘women’s stuff,’” said Veronica Raimo, author of the novel “The Girl at the Door,” an exploration of marriage, pregnancy and sexual assault allegations that was translated into English this year. “There was this idea that stories told by women couldn’t be universal. But that’s changing.”
One author to see the progress firsthand is Helena Janeczek, who has been publishing for decades but who last year became the first woman in 15 years to win the Premio Strega, the country’s top literary award.
“That was quite a time gap, wasn’t it?” she said. “But I wasn’t that surprised. The times are changing.”
The book that won her the award, published in October in English as “The Girl With the Leica,” is a historical novel about the war photographer Gerda Taro, who was killed in 1937 while documenting the Spanish Civil War with her more famous boyfriend and colleague, Robert Capa.
In the past two years, novels by women have accounted for roughly half of Italy’s top 20 best sellers in fiction — nearly double the percentage from 2017, according to data released by Informazioni Editoriali, which surveys sales in the country’s bookshops.
In interviews, Italian authors, editors, critics, translators and publishers said that women writers have gained extraordinary attention. Some call it “the Ferrante effect.”
“My Brilliant Friend” and the other Ferrante novels (her latest, “La Vita Bugiarda Degli Adulti,” came out in Italian last month and is slated for publication in English as “The Lying Life of Adults” next year) showed that “there is a market for fiction by women,” said Daniela Brogi, a contemporary literature scholar at the University for Foreigners of Siena. “And they also gave literary dignity to fiction about women.”
Establishment critics were previously quick to disregard stories about the bonds between women. That has changed.
Three much-discussed recent books delve into mother-daughter relationships. Donatella Di Pietrantonio’s “A Girl, Returned,” released last summer in English, is a coming-of-age story set in rural Southern Italy. Claudia Durastanti’s “La Straniera” (“The Stranger”) recalls her upbringing in a dysfunctional family between Brooklyn and Basilicata. Nadia Terranova’s novel “Addio Fantasmi” (“Goodbye Ghosts”) tells the story of a 30-something woman facing her painful past on a trip home to see her mother. Both of those are being translated into English.
Raimo, the author of “The Girl at the Door,” said that younger readers in Italy have become more open to women writers partly as a result of having read women in translation.
“They know there are countries in which having someone like Jennifer Egan or Zadie Smith is normal,” she said.
But many of the new wave of women writers attribute their momentum to the pseudonymous Ferrante, who has guarded her anonymity even as her books have become best sellers. (Some people speculate that Ferrante could be Anita Raja, a prominent literary translator married to the novelist Domenico Starnone, and they have looked for evidence of his hand in her work.)
Beyond the guessing game, Ferrante has generated international interest in Italian writers overall.
“There’s a global buzz about contemporary Italian writers, including many women and even minorities, and we owe a lot to her for that,” said Igiaba Scego, a Somali-Italian writer. Her novel “Beyond Babylon,” which explores the traumas of the immigrant experience through the eyes of two women, was translated into English this year after being published in Italy a decade ago.
Some new translations of Italian works reach back even further.
A new English translation of “Family Lexicon,” the 1963 masterpiece by Natalia Ginzburg, came out in 2017. Three more of her novels were reissued this year, two of them in new translations. Another major writer from Italy’s postwar period, Elsa Morante (whom Ferrante has cited as a source of inspiration), is likewise getting a fresh look, with a new translation this year of her coming-of-age classic, “Arturo’s Island.”
And yet, Italian women writers still face obstacles.
“The problem is not getting published or selling copies,” Janeczek said. “It’s getting recognition.”
She said that women have generally been kept far from the Italian canon, and that Ferrante’s success overseas is not likely to get her much closer. “When she had all that recognition abroad, our critics said ‘Look, those Americans think she’s a great writer,’” Janeczek said.
In 2015, as Ferrante was receiving enormous acclaim, the novelist Francesco Longo wrote in the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero that “Ferrante is a powerful storyteller. But not a writer.”
Some of Italy’s female critics think their male counterparts are missing the point.
Tiziana de Rogatis, a critic whose book on Ferrante’s diction came out in the United States this month, said that Ferrante, like Morante, is a sophisticated thinker and writer who chooses to write plainly and empathetically to be understood. Academia, she said, eventually catches up with great authors “first popular with the public.”
Some writers and literature professors argue that dusty elitism, more than overt sexism, hinders women from being recognized.
“There is a widespread idea here that literary fiction should be virtuoso and self-referential,” said Elisa Gambaro, a scholar at the University of Milan. As a result, fiction that is commercially successful is often disparaged.
But some women say it should be the other way around.
“To put it bluntly, women writers tend to be less self-referential, because they’re less used to thinking of themselves as the center of the world,” said Brogi, the contemporary literature scholar at the University for Foreigners of Siena. She said women developed literary language to make themselves better understood — and incidentally, easier to translate — because they were so often ignored. It was a condition, she said, that Ferrante had eloquently coined as “smarginatura,” or, roughly put, being pushed to the margins.
But this new crop of women writers is pushing toward the center.
“We are standing up for each other, and calling out the double standards,” Durastanti said. “This sense of sisterhood wasn’t there a few years ago.”
Terranova said the results were already there to see.
“Italy always had great women writers,” she said. “The truly new thing is that, for the first time, they’re getting recognition.”
Correction: Dec. 9, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the setting of the book “La Straniera.” It is between Brooklyn and Basilicata, not Brooklyn and Abruzzo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crossword blog: the New Yorker's cryptic puzzles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year, we were delighted to see that the New Yorker had begun a crossword series, which has since gone twice-weekly. I feigned annoyance that the puzzles weren’t cryptic; they are, in fact a challenging and literate take on the American puzzle style, which often misleads in a way that’s not a million miles from our own crosswords.
The New Yorker did have a cryptic – in the 1990s. Last month, the magazine created the post of puzzles-and-games editor. Liz Maynes-Aminzade is the inaugural honcho and, she tells me, was persuaded by her colleague Nick Henriquez to try solving some of the cryptics in the archive. “I had to really sweat through the first five or so,” she says, “but then something clicked. Now, of course, I love them.”
A batch of the old puzzles has reappeared as a kind of Thanksgiving gift, with more to follow weekly. They’re very moreish, partly because they use 10-by-8 grids (in “portrait” orientation); I presumed that this was solely to give newcomers a gentler solving experience, but there’s more to it. Says Maynes-Aminzade:
Of course the visuals were part of the decision. And in terms of construction, the clues are closer to the Guardian’s quiptic (“for beginners and those in a hurry”) than, say, an Enigmatist workout. I wondered what would be the American equivalents of all those British abbreviations from cricket and the armed forces that make UK cryptics that little bit tricker for non-native solvers. Letters denoting things from private healthcare, sports leagues and the way they name their radio stations, perhaps?
But the hurdle isn’t there. “When our puzzles use abbreviations and initialisms,” says Maynes-Aminzade, “they tend to be common ones: periodic table elements, cardinal directions, etc. In other words, our puzzle is easier than yours!”
“Maybe the closest analog,” she adds, “would be names of American actors – I’ve seen multiple puzzles that play on SLY for Sylvester Stallone, for instance. But I imagine even these references to the Italian Stallion will be legible to British solvers.”
They are, and it’s worth noting here that it’s a shame that I come across the fine Irish actor Stephen RAE more often in American puzzles than I do in the film pages of British papers. And in the New Yorker’s cryptics, there are more British bits and pieces – ETON collars, say – than I had expected to find. Does the American cryptic community overlap with the anglophone gang?
Yes, we know the type. Some of them probably even read the Guardian. Two of the paper’s setters, Anna Shechtman and Erik Agard, have made a video guide to cryptic wordplay. Depending how the old puzzles go down, we may be seeing some new cryptics from the likes of that pair. I hope we do.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harington Reacts to Golden Globe Nom: "I'm the Loner Throner"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In Game of Thrones' sixth season, Kit Harington's Jon Snow, recently brought back to life, stood with sword in hand facing down an army of enemies all on his own. The "Battle of the Bastards" war hero survived that day, and indeed survived the entire series — and for Harington, the actor is once again hitting the battlefield by himself, this time at the 2020 Golden Globes, the lone nominee for Thrones' final season.
"I'm the 'loner Throner,' it seems," Harington tells The Hollywood Reporter about his nomination, the only one Thrones received for its eighth and final season. "I just imagine myself sitting down at a table all by myself as the 'loner Throner!'"
Nominated in the best actor category alongside the likes of Succession star Brian Cox and Mr. Robot lead Rami Malek, Harington's nomination for the final Thrones season marks the actor's first ever Golden Globes nomination. Calling in from "the cold and wet streets of London," Harington says he was at home when the nominations rolled out, blissfully unaware "that it was so early in the U.S." (As he puts it: "I'm looking forward to sunny L.A., I'll tell you that much.")
"I didn't expect to be nominated," says Harington. "I thought the show might be, but I was just at home, learning lines, and then my publicists called. It was very unexpected and wonderful."
"Every time I go to say goodbye to this show, something comes along that reminds me of the story of it," he adds. "This is one of those moments. I have to say thanks to the HFPA for nominating me. We spent a lot of years with this thing. Obviously, I dearly loved it. I loved every moment of it. I loved the character. It's a weird feeling, but I feel kind of happy for him, the character, if that makes sense."
The rightful ruler of Westeros by bloodline if not desire, Harington's Jon Snow ended Game of Thrones alive, as far away from the King's Landing political machine as possible: the far North, well beyond the Wall, walking into the Haunted Forest alongside Free Folk and fellow members of the Night's Watch. It was not an entirely happy ending for the character, who plunged a dagger into the heart of Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in that final hour, but it was one Harington feels Snow very much earned. 
"For me, that's the perfect ending for him," he says. "It's where I wanted him to be. I didn't want him on the throne, and I didn't want him to be dead. I wanted him to be in the North, where he belongs. My feeling is where he ended in the show is exactly where he should have ended. There was a full-circledness to it. This [nomination] feels full circle, too. It's a lovely way to say goodbye to the character. It's a lovely way to say goodbye to the show. It's perfect, in my book."
Of course, as the sole Thrones nominee heading into Golden Globes night, Harington acknowledges some missing ingredients for the completely perfect ending: "Obviously, I'm sad I'm not going to be there with Emilia, Peter [Dinklage], the rest of the cast, or [David Benioff and Dan Weiss]… obviously, I wanted everyone to be nominated, and I feel like they should, as anyone who loves their show and loves their cast and crew would feel and want. I'm happy for my nomination, and I'd love the show to be represented [more], but it won an Emmy, and it wasn't nominated for a Globe. So I'll represent the show on my own. I'll do my best."
As for anyone who thinks the former Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and King in the North suddenly has unexpected open space at the Game of Thrones table on Golden Globes night? Think again.
"If [the cast and crew] can't make it, I'm just going to reserve the seats for no one," he says. "I think it's important that I look like I'm on my own." To riff on what one of his character's closest companions once said: "You know no one, Jon Snow."

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity winner Jacqueline Jossa doing 'fine' after 'tough time' in jungle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa is doing "fine" after her win, according to runner-up Andy Whyment.
The Coronation Street actor, who plays Kirk Sutherland on the ITV soap, revealed the former EastEnders actress had a "tough time" in the jungle.
Jacqueline broke down in tears as Ant and Dec crowned her Queen of the Jungle on Sunday night.
She then had an emotional reunion with husband Dan Osborne on the bridge, before finally being reunited with her two young daughters Ella and Mia at the hotel.
Andy and co-star Kate Garraway appeared on Good Morning Britain on Monday morning to discuss the final.
Fresh from the news that Jacqueline had cancelled all live TV interviews following her win, because of other filming and wanting to spend time with her family, Andy praised the star.
He said she was "fine" but "dazed" after winning the series, as he referenced her "tough time" in the jungle.
Andy told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: "She’s fine, we’ve just done some filming for the Coming Out show.
"She looks fine, she's got a magnificent dress on and she's still got her crown on. She had a tough time in there at times, she’s done really well."
Kate added that viewers will love the sweet moment when Jacqueline sees her children for the first time.
It comes after reports earlier on in the series, that Jacqueline's campmate Myles Stephenson spoke to her about rumours his ex Gabby Allen had slept with her husband Dan.
The fling claims emerged after pictures of the pair together at a bootcamp last year, with Dan and Gabby fiercely denying anything ever happened between them.
Jacqueline is said to have been threatening to quit the series after Myles apparently told her what he believed happened between Gabby and Dan.
Towards the end of the series, Dan was faced with fresh cheating claims by former CelebrityBig Brother co-star Chloe Ayling , who claimed she had a "threesome" with him and Natalie Nunn .
Dan hit back at the claims, denying anything happened, as he shared mass support for his wife online ahead of her win.
As the pair reunited on the bridge, Dan picked a sobbing Jacqueline up and embraced her, before the couple smiled for photos.
He then joined her as they made their way back to the hotel, where she ran to meet her young daughters who were waiting with her parents.
I'm A Celebrity's Coming Out show airs Thursday night at 9pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity's Jacqueline Jossa first winner to cancel live TV interviews</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an unexpected first for the show, Jacqueline Jossa looks set to be the first I'm a Celebrity winner not to take part in live TV interviews following her big win on Sunday night.
In a major upset to bookies who had runner-up Andy Whyment as the odds on favourite to triumph in the final, Eastenders actress Jacqueline topped the public vote and looked stunned at being announced as winner by Ant and Dec.
Jacqueline's victory, while well received by plenty of people who heralded her a well deserving winner, didn't go down too well with others who thought Andy should have won.
Some angry fans have even gone as far as saying the result was fixed.
Once the dust has settled on their jungle win and they've enjoyed a bit of R&R, it is customary for I'm A Celebrity champions to take part in a series of live TV interviews, on the likes of GMB and This Morning, but according to The Mirror,Jacqueline has decided against doing them.
A source close to Jacqueline has told Mirror Online that she has chosen to spend time with her kids, with her also busy filming for ITV.
They said: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.
"Jacqueline and Dan (husband) spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."
While she was getting stuck into everything jungle life had to throw at her, Jacqueline's TOWIE star husband Dan had to deny cheating claims from model Chloe Ayling, who he appeared in Celebrity Big Brother with in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julia Louis-Dreyfus says people took ‘crazy drugs’ when she worked on SNL</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Julia Louis-Dreyfus has claimed people working on Saturday Night Live “were doing crazy drugs” during her tenure on the show.
The actor and comedian, who appeared on SNL between 1982 and 1985, also claimed the programme was “very sexist” at the time.
“I was unbelievably naive and I didn’t really understand how the dynamics of the place worked,” she told Stephen Colbert at a Q&A during the Montclair Film Festival.
“It was very sexist, very sexist. People were doing crazy drugs at the time. I was oblivious. I just thought, ‘Oh wow. He’s got a lot of energy.'”
When she joined the NBC variety show in 1982, Louis-Dreyfus became SNL’s youngest female cast member at that time and shared the stage with Eddie Murphy, Martin Short and Billy Crystal, among others.
“It was a pretty brutal time, but it was a very informative time for me,” she added.
“I learned I wasn’t going to do any more of this show-business crap unless it was fun,” she said. “I don’t have to walk and crawl through this kind of nasty glass if it’s not ultimately going to be fulfilling, and so that’s how I sort of moved forward from that moment.
"I sort of applied that ‘fun metre’ to every job I’ve had since and that has been very helpful.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rene Auberjonois death: Star Trek family pays tribute as Deep Space Nine actor dies, aged 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Trek: Deep Space Nineactor Rene Auberjonois has died, aged 79.
The prolific character actor, who also starred in sitcom Benson and Robert Altman film MASH (1970), died of metastatic lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles, his son Remy-Luc Auberjonois told PA.
Auberjonois' career spanned five decades, beginning with theatre in the 1960s before moving on to films in the 1970s and television shows in the 1980s.
He frequently collaborated with Altman, starring in his films McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971) and Images (1972).
In Benson – the ABC series whose title character was a butler played by Robert Guillaume – he played Clayton Runnymede Endicott III, the chief of staff at a governor’s mansion. 
For science-fiction fans and convention-goers ever since, he was Odo, the shape-shifting Changeling and head of space-station security on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
“I am all of those characters, and I love that,” Auberjonois said in a 2011 interview with the Star Trek website.
“I also run into people, and they think I’m their cousin or their dry cleaner. I love that, too.”
Auberjonois' Star Trek family, including his Boston Legal co-star William Shatner and George Takei, led tributes to the actor.
Takei called the actor's death "a real loss," writing: "Star Trek fans knew him as Odo from Deep Space Nine. We knew him as Rene. He was a wonderful, caring, and intelligent man. He shall be missed. When I look out to the stars, I shall think of you, friend."
Shatner wrote: "To sum up his life in a tweet is nearly impossible. To Judith, Tessa & Remy I send you my love and strength. I will keep you in my thoughts and remember a wonderful friendship with Rene."
Other stars to pay tribute include Gates McFadden, Larry Nemecek, Robert Hewitt Wolfe and Armin Shimerman.
Auberjonois'  was born in New York in 1940, the son of Fernand Auberjonois, Swiss-born foreign correspondent for US newspapers, and the grandson of a Swiss post-impressionist painter also named Rene Auberjonois.
After graduating from college at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon, Auberjonois hopped around the country joining theatre companies, eventually landing three roles on Broadway in 1968, including playing the Fool in a long-running version of King Lear.
The following year he would play Sebastian Baye opposite Katharine Hepburn in Coco, a play on the life of designer Coco Chanel that would earn him a Tony for best actor in a leading role in a musical.
He received Tony nominations for 1973’s The Good Doctor, 1984’s Big River, and 1989’s City of Angels.
Auberjonois' other film credits include the 1976 version of King Long, mystery thriller The Eyes of Laura Mars (1978) and Certain Women (2016).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans just can't get enough of Deepika Padukone and her Instagram handle updates, they just keep on wanting more. Not just her Insta updates but special comments by her hubby Ranveer on her posts is also something fans await for with breathed breathe. Today, the actress through her social media handle, announced the trailer release of her upcoming film, 'Chhapaak' which is happening tomorrow. However, before the announcement, she treated her fans with a few throwback pictures which are noteworthy.
One of the throwback pictures which she shared has Deepika posing with her two besties and we bet you will not recognize the 'Padmaavat' actress at a first glance.
In the picture, we can see the three childhood friends, posing together. Interestingly, three of them are dressed in white and are sporting a similar hair cut which is making it more difficult for the fans to make out Deepika from the frame. However, a true Deepika fan will make out that the third girl with a sparkling smile is Deepika, who is leaning on her friends' shoulder.
This particular picture earned praises from the fans and we are waiting for Ranveer to comment on this super adorable picture of hers.
On the professional front, Deepika will be seen in Meghna Gulzar's 'Chhapaak' opposite Vikrant Massey. The film is about acid attack survivor Laxmi Aggarwal. Moreover, she will also be seen in Kabir Khan's '83' as Kapil Dev's wife Romi Bhatia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Miss South Africa crowned 2019 Miss Universe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Miss South Africa rules all.
Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss Universe Sunday night after excelling through rounds of swimsuit and evening gown struts, questions on social issues and one final chance to explain why she was the right choice.
"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me — with my kind of skin and my kind of hair — was never considered to be beautiful," she said in her last response. "I think it is time that that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face and I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."
The two runners-up for the crown were Miss Mexico and Miss Puerto Rico.
"If you do not use your beauty for your life's mission, it's just an empty ornament," Sofía Aragón, representing Mexico, said earlier in the competition.
Madison Anderson represented Puerto Rico.
"Being on the Miss Universe stage is not just a dream" Anderson said. "I believe that I found my mission. It's a representation of dedication, resilience and perseverance. I do believe my mission is to show the world that magic happens when we refuse to give up because the universe always listens to a stubborn heart."
And if you're wondering, yes, there was another mix-up and Steve Harvey was involved in it. But it was nothing like the 2015 disaster when he called out the wrong winner.
Harvey hosted the pageant for the fifth time sporting a bedazzled green and gold suit jacket.
He was commenting on a costume from earlier in week and said Miss Philippines won the National Costume Contest. But the woman standing next to him said she was Miss Malaysia.
"Y'all got to quit doing this to me," he said.
The massive competition was hosted at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.
It has already made history with Miss Myanmar, Swe Zin Htet, who says she's the first openly gay contestant.
Last year's winner, Catriona Gray from the Philippines spoke during Sunday's pageant, saying the past year has been "unforgettable, life-changing and purposeful."
"We're getting this amazing platform to voice the things we're passionate about, the things we care about," she said in a video. "I always had a voice, but Miss Universe allowed me to amplify it."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome back to Engadget's Gaming IRL, a monthly segment where we run down what our editors are playing. This month, we couldn't help but plow through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and devote plenty of time to FIFA 18. And we made some time for classic real-time strategy with Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition.
We'd love to hear what you've been playing, chime in on the comments below!

The notion of Respawn Entertainment diving into the Star Wars universe seemed like a perfect fit. With the excellent (but under-appreciated) Titanfall 2, Respawn proved it could make an engaging shooter campaign in an era obsessed with multiplayer shooters. Star Wars, meanwhile, was ripe for a new single-player experience, especially after the disastrous launch of Battlefront II. So it comes as no surprise that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the best gaming experiences of the year. It could use a bit more polish, but for fans of the franchise, it's still incredibly rewarding.
As we covered in our preview, Fallen Order puts you in the boots of Cal Kestis, a Padawan who's in hiding after the Empire wiped out most of the Jedi. Taking place after the events of Revenge of the Sith, but long before the original Star Wars, the game focuses on one of the darkest periods in the franchise. Cal isn't just a reluctant hero, he's living with the childhood scars of seeing his master and other Jedi brutally murdered in front of him. Before A New Hope, there really doesn't seem to be any hope at all.
But it's not too long before Cal starts to find his way, thanks to the help of another former Jedi, Cere Junda, and their ornery alien pilot, Greez Dritus. It wouldn't be a Star Wars game without notable baddies -- in Fallen Order, the most intriguing one is the Second Sister, a Jedi-hunting Inquisitor for the Empire. While the general thrust of the story might seem familiar, Respawn's writing team manages to explore new territory with these characters. Cal, Cere and even the Second Sister are shackled by lives filled with suffering and regret -- what makes them interesting is how they deal with that.
Fallen Order is clearly inspired by the Souls games -- combat is methodical, and it's very easy to get wiped out by weak enemies if you're not paying attention. Still, this is one area where the game falters a bit. Parrying and dodging attacks isn't nearly as precise as From Software's Sekiro and Bloodborne, which makes the higher difficulties feel unnecessarily punishing. Crowd control gets a bit easier as you acquire more force powers -- I particularly enjoyed pushing loudmouth tough guys to their doom. At its best, Fallen Order manages to make you feel like a light saber-toting Jedi Master, I just wish it did that more consistently.
The game's exploration is baffling as well: your map clearly lays out new paths to follow as you gain new powers. But there's no fast travel, so if you see a new door available on the other end of a planet, you'll have to hoof it there on foot. There are a few shortcuts to make life easier, but it's still no replacement for fast travel. At one point, I found myself deep in the wreckage of a fallen Star Destroyer, and I just quit the game out of frustration to avoid dealing with the trek back to my ship.
It's easy to feel inundated with Star Wars today, with The Rise of the Skywalker coming at the end of the month, and the Mandalorian on Disney+ making Baby Yoda a new viral icon. But Fallen Order is a reminder there are still rewarding ways to explore this universe. And hopefully in a follow up, Respawn will have more time to refine its use of the force.

Irish comedian Dara Ó Briain has a routine that sums up a lot of my frustration with the state of modern video gaming. "You cannot be bad at watching a movie," he says, "but you can be bad at a video game." "And the video game will punish you [for being bad] and deny you access to the rest of the video game," he added. He was talking about his frustration with how Guitar Hero actively thwarts your attempts to play at being a rockstar. Because you need to work through the game's discography, song by song, as if you were paying your dues in the music industry.
It's a pursuit of realism that is both laudable and frustrating if you've little time or patience for the 60-hour grind-a-thons most games have become. Doubly so if you're tasked with grooming or dressing your character as a way of stretching out the entertainment even further. I want games to snip out the dull components of life and just let me get to the exciting, daft bits. That's the point of a video game that exists for our entertainment, as a preferable alternative to real life.
Which brings me around to FIFA 18, a game that sees you handing money to two of the world's most beloved institutions: EA and FIFA. The title was the first FIFA game I'd bought since FIFA 13, which I'd played fairly religiously on my Xbox 360 since it came out -- to the point where the Career Mode team I had lovingly developed since the start were now successful internationals.
Obviously I'd missed the FIFA games coded on EA's Ignite engine, and 18 was built in Frostbite. I knew that there would be some differences in gameplay, but what upset me the most was how entertainment had been sacrificed on the altar of fidelity. It made me not want to play the game, which now seemed designed to actively thwart my dreams of having fun.
Previously when playing Career Mode, you were able to look through a player's statistics and data to see how good a player they were. That meant if you were in the market for someone new, you were able to spend some time looking for someone who fitted in with your playing style. That database was easily searched and quick to rifle through, making it great for when you wanted to get nerdy.
But because in the real world, where there's no guarantee that the player you're going to sign will turn out to be Eden Hazard or Eden Massouema, the spreadsheet is gone in FIFA 18. In its place, there's a process of hiring scouts to look at each player you may decide to look at, which can take weeks, or months. And then it's mostly down to the accuracy and reliability of the scout.
It's a similar situation when it comes to negotiating transfers and contracts with players, now with added theater. Rather than simply offering them a price and a duration, you have to endure a branching, RPG-style cut scene with dramatic music. The player's agent basically insists on whatever they say, and there's no point negotiating with them because they always say no.
In one regard, I get it -- in the real world, players won't simply take a pay cut in exchange for more bonuses, or more playing time. Not that I necessarily want to do that -- but I would like to give all of my first teamers the same flat salary. After all, in my football utopia, that's how it would work, especially at the cash-strapped club I'm currently managing.
"Ah Dan," you may rightly say, "but this is about realism and bringing a true and accurate version of the football world to your home." But were that the case, then surely as soon as I put the disc in, the game would refuse to play, given that I haven't studied for the UEFA A-License. Playing FIFA isn't about the grinding mundanity of football if you don't want it to be, and I don't.
It's also irritating when a player complains about being dropped from a single game, saying they're not getting enough game time. Especially when they've played every minute in a league so far, and I was only resting them for the big cup tie three days later. The game has no sense of internal logic to understand why and how you would rotate players... which is surely more realistic?
And then there's the UI, which is far too busy, overcomplicated and badly laid out compared to its five-year predecessor. Why is player contracts, a seemingly crucial part of the game, buried in the squad hub rather than in transfers? Why do you have to shortlist a player and then go back out of search and into transfers to make an approach, rather than doing it there?
Why, rather than an easily-navigable squad selection, does everything involve so much extra scrolling? Player selection in FIFA 13 was so much better and easier than it is now, and I'm baffled that EA thinks this is somehow better.
Of course I'm still playing it, if only because of the better graphical fidelity and the fact FIFA 13 isn't available on the PS4. But I'm still gonna grouse about it.

In between all the high-profile releases this fall, you may have missed the fact Microsoft released Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, a part remaster, part remake of one of the best real-time strategy games ever made. Recreating a masterpiece is fraught with all sorts of downsides, and it's especially tricky with a game like Age of Empires II that has so much history behind it.
Definitive Edition is technically the game's second re-release. Back in 2013, Forgotten Empires, one of the studios involved in Definitive Edition, updated the game and its excellent Age of Conquerors expansion with high-definition graphics, releasing the package as Age of Empires II: HD Edition. It was a serviceable if uninspired update to a classic. In the intervening years, however, Forgotten Empires continued to work on the game, creating new expansions that add additional playable civilizations and single-player campaigns.
And so Definitive Edition feels like the work of a group of people who have spent the better part of a decade devoted to a game they love, and it shows. The beauty of this re-release is that it stays true to what made Age of Empires II great in the first place, while adding a new level polish. Take the game's presentation, for example. By standards of most modern games, a lot of what Age of Empires II offers on that front is modest. For example, the briefings that play before each campaign mission are a simple affair, with just some drawings and a lone voice to guide you through to the next scenario. And yet they do an excellent job of setting the stage and establishing the stakes.
Forgotten Empires didn't try to reinvent the wheel here; instead, the team gave the briefings (and everything else, for that matter) a fresh coat of paint. The sum total of all these enhancements is that Definitive Edition feels both just as good and better than you remember it, and that is a rare feat for a remaster to achieve.

Because you need to work through the game's discography, song by song, as if you were paying your dues in the music industry.
It's a pursuit of realism that is both laudable and frustrating if you've little time or patience for the 60-hour grind-a-thons most games have become. Doubly so if you're tasked with grooming or dressing your character as a way of stretching out the entertainment even further. I want games to snip out the dull components of life and just let me get to the exciting, daft bits. That's the point of a video game that exists for our entertainment, as a preferable alternative to real life.
Which brings me around to FIFA 18, a game that sees you handing money to two of the world's most beloved institutions: EA and FIFA. The title was the first FIFA game I'd bought since FIFA 13, which I'd played fairly religiously on my Xbox 360 since it came out -- to the point where the Career Mode team I had lovingly developed since the start were now successful internationals.
Obviously I'd missed the FIFA games coded on EA's Ignite engine, and 18 was built in Frostbite. I knew that there would be some differences in gameplay, but what upset me the most was how entertainment had been sacrificed on the altar of fidelity. It made me not want to play the game, which now seemed designed to actively thwart my dreams of having fun.
Previously when playing Career Mode, you were able to look through a player's statistics and data to see how good a player they were. That meant if you were in the market for someone new, you were able to spend some time looking for someone who fitted in with your playing style. That database was easily searched and quick to rifle through, making it great for when you wanted to get nerdy.
But because in the real world, where there's no guarantee that the player you're going to sign will turn out to be Eden Hazard or Eden Massouema, the spreadsheet is gone in FIFA 18. In its place, there's a process of hiring scouts to look at each player you may decide to look at, which can take weeks, or months. And then it's mostly down to the accuracy and reliability of the scout.
It's a similar situation when it comes to negotiating transfers and contracts with players, now with added theater. Rather than simply offering them a price and a duration, you have to endure a branching, RPG-style cut scene with dramatic music. The player's agent basically insists on whatever they say, and there's no point negotiating with them because they always say no.
In one regard, I get it -- in the real world, players won't simply take a pay cut in exchange for more bonuses, or more playing time. Not that I necessarily want to do that -- but I would like to give all of my first teamers the same flat salary. After all, in my football utopia, that's how it would work, especially at the cash-strapped club I'm currently managing.
"Ah Dan," you may rightly say, "but this is about realism and bringing a true and accurate version of the football world to your home." But were that the case, then surely as soon as I put the disc in, the game would refuse to play, given that I haven't studied for the UEFA A-License. Playing FIFA isn't about the grinding mundanity of football if you don't want it to be, and I don't.
It's also irritating when a player complains about being dropped from a single game, saying they're not getting enough game time. Especially when they've played every minute in a league so far, and I was only resting them for the big cup tie three days later. The game has no sense of internal logic to understand why and how you would rotate players... which is surely more realistic?
And then there's the UI, which is far too busy, overcomplicated and badly laid out compared to its five-year predecessor. Why is player contracts, a seemingly crucial part of the game, buried in the squad hub rather than in transfers? Why do you have to shortlist a player and then go back out of search and into transfers to make an approach, rather than doing it there?
Why, rather than an easily-navigable squad selection, does everything involve so much extra scrolling? Player selection in FIFA 13 was so much better and easier than it is now, and I'm baffled that EA thinks this is somehow better.
Of course I'm still playing it, if only because of the better graphical fidelity and the fact FIFA 13 isn't available on the PS4. But I'm still gonna grouse about it.

In between all the high-profile releases this fall, you may have missed the fact Microsoft released Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, a part remaster, part remake of one of the best real-time strategy games ever made. Recreating a masterpiece is fraught with all sorts of downsides, and it's especially tricky with a game like Age of Empires II that has so much history behind it.
Definitive Edition is technically the game's second re-release. Back in 2013, Forgotten Empires, one of the studios involved in Definitive Edition, updated the game and its excellent Age of Conquerors expansion with high-definition graphics, releasing the package as Age of Empires II: HD Edition. It was a serviceable if uninspired update to a classic. In the intervening years, however, Forgotten Empires continued to work on the game, creating new expansions that add additional playable civilizations and single-player campaigns.
And so Definitive Edition feels like the work of a group of people who have spent the better part of a decade devoted to a game they love, and it shows. The beauty of this re-release is that it stays true to what made Age of Empires II great in the first place, while adding a new level polish. Take the game's presentation, for example. By standards of most modern games, a lot of what Age of Empires II offers on that front is modest. For example, the briefings that play before each campaign mission are a simple affair, with just some drawings and a lone voice to guide you through to the next scenario. And yet they do an excellent job of setting the stage and establishing the stakes.
Forgotten Empires didn't try to reinvent the wheel here; instead, the team gave the briefings (and everything else, for that matter) a fresh coat of paint. The sum total of all these enhancements is that Definitive Edition feels both just as good and better than you remember it, and that is a rare feat for a remaster to achieve.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman opens shop selling black dolls as a way to cope with grief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sanda Monero started making dolls as a form of therapy, during a time she was struggling.
After being inspired by the woman in her life, Sandra made black dolls with different shades and hairstyles.
What started as a hobby grew and grew and last year Sandra, from Stoke Newington, decided to open her own store called Monero Kids Boutique in Balls Pond Road.
As well as her ‘gratitude dolls’, Sandra, who has also worked in social care, also sells eco-friendly children’s clothing and educational books.
Sandra takes inspiration from her St Lucian heritage and upbringing in London and uses Caribbean and African fabrics such as Kente cloth in her work.
Currently, she has a range of dolls clothing in production with one for every Caribbean island.
Of course, there are thousands of islands, which would take forever to create so Sandra is sticking to approximately 26 dolls.
Her idea started when she lost her parents and her brother – something she still finds difficult to talk about – but she says that having the focus of creating doll clothes has helped to bring her happiness back.
She hopes to introduce two male dolls – one to represent her father and one for her older brother.
‘It is very important as [these dolls] represents little girls and boys’ Sandra told Metro.co.uk.
‘Growing up, I only knew about Barbie and Sindy and of course, I wanted to be like them.
‘But being a black child it was impossible as it did not represent me at all. I am so lucky, now, I am in a position to be able to share and showcase dolls for boys and girls that represent their colour tone.’
There are three main dolls in the Monero Doll collection –  Honey, Ellie and Harley D.
One of the dolls, Ellie, is named after Sandra’s mum who she describes as a ‘beautiful, graceful woman’.
She adds: ‘Honey, is named after a friend of mine called Yinka who has supported and helped me through my challenges.
‘Harley D is named after the Harley Davidson motorcycle as I have a passion for bikes. In addition, her character is partly built around myself and the daughter I would have had.’
She recalls one of her favourite memories in at the Boutique when a little white girl called Hannah came in.
‘She came in and bought the darkest doll,’ said Sandra. ‘When asked why she had chosen that one she said: “Mummy, she looks like my best friend Yemi”.’
If you want to visit Sandra’s store, you can find it in Dalston Junction at 26a Balls Pond Road, London N1 4AU.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cardi B denies snubbing meet-and-greet in Ghana to eat kebab</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cardi B hit the clubs in Ghana with T.I. this weekend, just as she was forced to hit back at claims she ‘snubbed’ a meet-and-greet to lounge by the pool eating a kebab.
The I Like It rapper flew out to Nigeria last week to begin her tour of West Africa before making the short trip over to Ghana for more events.
After touching down on her private jet, Cardi received a warm welcome at the airport in Accra where a large horde of fans and photographers were waiting to catch a glimpse of the rap superstar.
Cardi, 27, then settled into her luxurious hotel suite, which included a large bathroom with his and her sinks and a standalone bathtub, large corridors, several rooms and a stunning view with the ocean in the distance.
Hours later, Cardi then hit the club for her scheduled appearance at Livespot x Festival where T.I. and his wife Tiny just happened to be.
In an Instagram video, Cardi is seen dancing the VIP section as T.I. sips his drink while cuddling Tiny.
‘@tip and @tiny makin some big money moves out here!’ Cardi captioned the clip.
It came after Cardi was forced to defend herself after it was claimed she had snubbed a meet-and-greet earlier in the day.
The Bodak Yellow rapper shared an Instagram story of herself sitting by the hotel pool and eating a kebab, which is called Chinchinga in Ghana, at the same time the meet-and-greet was taking place.
However, Cardi argues she wasn’t aware the event was in her contract and she wasn’t told about it.
In an Instagram video, the Grammy-winning rapper explained: ‘First things first, I asked my booking agent “do I have a meet and greet today?” So a meet-and-greet wasn’t in my contract, right? I didn’t know I had a motherf****n meet and greet today. I know I had one in Nigeria, I was on time for that, I did all of that.
‘I didn’t know I had one today. When I woke up, I went downstairs at around 3pm to soak up some sun in the pool and my stomach started hurting, that was around 3pm, right? [sic].’
Cardi continued: ‘Then I woke up, I see this rage going on on f*****g social media, and everybody’s like yeah you gotta do a meet and greet.
‘I seen there was a lot of my fans there at the meet and greet, so I thought you know what, I don’t give a f**k if it’s not in my contract, I’m going downstairs [sic].’
Many Ghanianian celebrities were also at the meet-and-greet after being invited to meet the Money rapper, and slammed Cardi on social media believing she had snubbed them.
Reacting to their anger, Cardi said: ‘Then I guess a lot of artists were upset because they got invited to the meet and greet and I wasn’t there. For that I apologise but then again that wasn’t my fault because it wasn’t me who did that.
‘Let me tell you what I don’t f*****g like, I saw a bunch of females, they supposed to be artists from here and I didn’t know that [sic].’
She continued: ‘But when I was around the pool at around 3pm, which is the time when the meet and greet was supposed to be going on, I was in the pool and the same girls talking s**t about me, saying I’m this or I’m that, y’all saw me… so if you see me around the pool and I’m chilling, staring at me as if I have a piece of f*****g s**t on my eyes, why don’t you come up to me and say, “Welcome to Ghana”? [sic]’
After flying out of Ghana, Cardi wrote in another Instagram post: ‘I was in Ghana for less than 24 hours. Went thru a lil dilemma but I still had fun [sic].’

    <h5 class="mb-1">You need to watch Netflix's Norwegian rom-com series Home For Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix is a treasure trove for so-bad-it’s-good Christmas movies – shout out to The Princess Switch and the entire A Christmas Prince franchise.
But a new festive series has landed on the streaming platform that actually just falls into the good category.
It’s a Christmas miracle!
Norwegian mini-series Home For Christmas (Hjem til jul) is delighting binge-watchers thanks to its whip-smart humour and clever twist on all the Christmas rom-com tropes.
The six-episode series stars Ida Elise Broch as Johanne, a 30-year-old who is smashing it in her job as a nurse and is surrounded by brilliant friends.
But as it hits December, her family only want to know one thing – when is she going to get a boyfriend?
Johanne is already feeling insecure as the ‘single and childless’ are forced to pick up Christmas Eve shifts, her friends with babies bond over the new level of tiredness that only parents can feel, and she runs into her perfect ex who has gone on to get married and have a kid, but when her mother seats her between her twin nephews at the dinner table, enough is enough.
To shut her family up, Johanne lies and says she has a boyfriend who she will bring along to dinner on Christmas Eve – meaning she has 24 days to find a man.
With the help of her housemate, Johanne gets on the dating apps to find her Christmas bae, but between hooking up with a 19-year-old, entering an escape room with a ‘psychopath’ and injuring her crotch while spinning, it’s not all that easy.
While the whole ‘single at Christmas’ thing has been done, Home For Christmas is a fresh look at the pressures of dating at 30 – think Bridget Jones but with Tinder in Norway – and even mocks its inspiration with a Love Actually inspired moment that goes on to point out everything wrong with the Christmas classic.
And those who have discovered the Norwegian series (which comes with English subtitles) are obsessed:
Home For Christmas only dropped on 5 December, but thanks to the series’ ending, people are already wondering if 2020 will bring a second series of the show.
Please, Santa, we’ll be good!
Home For Christmas is now streaming on Netflix – and if you need more festive Netflix fare, here’s the best Christmassy content available.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity's Roman baffled as Lorraine asks saucy question about girlfriend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lorraine Kelly accidentally put her foot in it while grilling I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! star Roman Kemp about his first night with girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury.
The radio DJ came third behind Andy Whyment and Queen of The Jungle Jacqueline Jossa last night in another nail-biting finale which saw more than 11 million viewers vote to crown their champion. Although, no one welcomed him when he left the jungle.
Naturally, everyone wanted to know what Roman did immediately after bursting through the doors of his lavish suite at the Versace Hotel in Brisbane, only Lorraine got slightly flustered when she realised she may have gone too far.
‘Tell me, as soon as you got back to that hotel and you gave Anne-Sophie a hug, what else did you do?’ the host began before jumping off her seat to explain herself.
‘You don’t have to tell me as much! I meant food… and things like that,’ she squirmed.
Yeah Lorraine, come on’ Roman teased, rolling his eyes.
Actually, Roman revealed he just rubbed his hands through the carpet and lived out his dreams with a hot shower.
The 26-year-old also admitted he’s ‘flattered’ by flirtations from Love Island winner Amber Gill, but he’s more than happy with his ‘missus’.
‘I’m flattered but it was an amazing moment when I saw my missus, I missed her so much,’ he stressed.
Following his exit Roman told hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly: ‘I’ve never had more fun… I couldn’t be more grateful.’
He added: ‘It’s a strange place down there, it’s an unnatural thing that forms a family within three weeks.’
Jacqueline is the first I’m A Celebrity winner to snub all interviews following her victory. During her stay in the jungle, it was reported she spoke to husband Dan Osborne in unaired scenes over allegations he cheated on the former EastEnders actress with Love Island’s Gabby Allen.
He was also accused of enjoying a threesome with his Celebrity Big Brother co-stars Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling. He’s denied both reports.
I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! is available to stream on ITV Hub. Lorraine airs weekdays at 8.30am on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I’m A Celebrity….Get Me Out Of Here crowns 2019 winner</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The final was a battle of the soap stars.
Jacqueline Jossa has won I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here after defeating Andy Whyment.
The final became a battle of the soap stars after the former EastEnders actress trumped the Coronation Street actor and radio DJ Roman Kemp came third.
After she was named queen of the jungle, she said: “I have no words.”
Before she won, she told hosts Ant & Dec: “It was not what I expected.
“It was a lot harder. I didn’t think it would be such a turning point in life, I went in as one person, I feel like I have come out as a different person.
“I’ve grown in confidence and found who I am as a person.”
She added: “I think it’s so easy to care so much what other people think of you, trolls, people who say nasty things for the sake of it and I try to change their opinion.
“Here you have no choice, you have to be you. Here I have different people bigging me up of different ages, I can’t really work out what is happening.
“I’ve always been known as Lauren from EastEnders, or a doormat, or whatever you want to call it, and coming here I have actually proved myself.”
While she was in the jungle, she hit the headlines after campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly told her that her husband Dan Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.
Former The Only Way Is Essex star Osborne and Allen were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.
It was reported that Jossa threatened to quit the show and was allowed by bosses to leave Osborne a voice message about Stephenson’s claims.
Osborne flew to Australia with their children to be there when she left the show, and after she left the jungle she was seen embracing Osborne before they posed for photographs.
Earlier in the episode, all three contestants took part in a final bushtucker trial.
Jossa faced the Stake Out, where she had to lie on a giant star on the floor with her legs and arms tied down as different insects were left to crawl over her body.
These included mealworms, crickets, scorpions and cockroaches, before she had to hold a spider in her mouth for the final minute.
After she finished, she joked to Ant and Dec: “You’re out of order.”
By successfully completing the trial, she scored starters for everyone, a drink and a surprise treat.
Whyment had to take part in the bushtucker bonanza, where he was given the choice between classic bushtucker dishes and more appetising options, but the tastier plates came at the expense of a star.
He chose witchetty grub over a prawn cocktail, a camel’s hoof over a roast chicken dinner, a whole scorpion over a sticky toffee pudding with custard, a pig’s testicle over a Bacardi and diet coke and a crocodile anus over a plate of chocolate biscuits.
After securing main courses for everyone, as well as as drink a treat, he said: “I’m so glad I’ve done it and got five stars.
“It’s been an amazing experiences and I still can’t believe I’m here, I’m a super fan so to get to the final I’m really chuffed. Come on guys give us a cuddle.”
Kemp was tasked with facing the panic pit, where he was strapped into an underground chamber and snakes crawled over his body.
As the lights went out, he said he could feel the tongues of the snakes on his skin and admitted it was “absolutely terrifying”.
His success scored him a pudding for everyone in camp, as well as a drink and a treat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Industry-backed campaign encourages gamers to vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the UK general election just four days away, a new campaign has been launched to encourage gamers to vote.
Founded by video game presenter and voice actor Elle Osili-Wood, the Gamechangers Giveaway has received support from across the industry.
AAA studios like Bethesda, Activision, and Ubisoft are joined by indie developers like Frontier, Spilt Milk Studios, and Raw Fury, along with PR agencies Indigo Pearl, Dead Good Media, and Renaissance PR, plus EGX and Insert Coin Clothing.
The Gamechangers Giveaway includes over two hundred video game prizes, which voters can win by tweeting a picture of themselves outside their polling station, using the Twitter hashtag #GamechangersGiveaway.
One winner will take home over 20 games, tickets to EGX Rezzed, £50 voucher for Insert Coin, a Dungeons & Dragons kit, and a range of game merchandise.
"It's never been more important to vote -- it's time to step up and be a gamechanger," said Osili-Wood. "With 85% of UK adults under 35 regularly playing video games, gamers are a significant demographic in the upcoming election, so I'm thrilled to see the games industry come together to get out the vote."
After nearly a decade of austerity and the Brexit still hanging in the balance, this year's general election -- called just two years after former prime minster Theresa May's disastrous attempt to secure a landslide majority -- has been described as the most important vote in a generation.
Since the 1997 general election, voter turnout in the UK hasn't risen above 70%. However, since falling to 59% in 2001, the figures have been steadily increasing. In 2017, voter turnout was at its highest in nearly 20 years.
The Gamechangers Giveaway will go live on Thursday, when polls open, and can be found by on Osili-Wood's Twitter, or by following the Twitter hashtag #GamechangersGiveaway.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netflix dominates Golden Globes nominations while Apple lands its first</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has announced the nominees for the 2020 Golden Globes, and this could be a milestone year for streaming. Netflix is even more of a frontrunner among streaming services than it was last year, with 17 TV network nominations and a flood of nods for movies like Marriage Story (six), The Irishman (five) and The Two Popes (four). In some cases, it's even the dominant force -- in both the best picture and best supporting actor categories, three out of five nominees are Netflix projects.
This is also a defining moment for Apple TV+, which is scoring its first Golden Globe nominations just weeks after its debut and mere hours after it got its first nomination for any award. The Morning Show received a best TV series drama nomination as well as two best TV actress nominations for its leads Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. While this won't give Netflix reason to panic, it's evident that Apple's big investments are paying off.
Amazon and Hulu also fared well with five TV network nominations apiece for titles like Fleabag, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Catch-22.
The flurry of nominations won't guarantee victory when the awards ceremony takes place on January 5th, 2020. It does suggest that streaming productions will take home at least some awards, though. And remember, the Golden Globes outcome is frequently considered a predictor for the Oscars. It's entirely possible that you'll see movies like Marriage Story and The Irishman receive more critical acclaim.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Marriage Story' leads Golden Globe nominations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK -- A Netflix wave swept over the 77th Golden Globe nominations, where the streaming company dominated with 34 total nominations, including four films up for best picture and four series nominated for the top television awards.
Noah Baumbach's divorce drama "Marriage Story" led all films with six nominations including best picture, drama, and acting nods for its two leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, in nominations announced Monday by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in Beverly Hills, California. "Marriage Story," which landed on Netflix on Friday after a three-week run in theatres, also earned nods for Baumbach's script, Laura Dern's supporting performance and Randy Newman's score. The only notable category it missed on was Baumbach for best director.
Three other Netflix films landed best picture nods, chief among them Martin Scorsese's mob epic "The Irishman," which landed five nominations including best drama picture, best director for Scorsese and supporting acting nods for Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Surprisingly left out was its lead, Robert De Niro.
Quentin Tarantino's 1960s Los Angeles fable "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," a Sony Pictures release, also scored five nominations, including best film comedy or musical and nods for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Tarantino is also up for best director. In a statement, DiCaprio called it "a love letter to Los Angeles" and "a celebration of cinema."
But the degree to which cinema -- that word that Scorsese has passionately argued over this season -- is changing was overwhelming apparent in Monday's nominations. Just as it is girding for battle with a host of new streaming services, Netflix flexed its muscles across all categories. HBO Max and NBCUniversal's Peacock are set to join the streaming fray next year, on the heels of the launch of Apple TV-Plus and Disney-Plus.
But for now, Hollywood belongs to Netflix. It also scored best picture nods for the Vatican bromance "The Two Popes" in the drama category (along with nominations for its stars, Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins); and the Eddie Murphy-led "Dolemite Is My Name" in the comedy category (along with an acting nod for Murphy).
Before landing four on Monday, Netflix had never earned a Golden Globes best picture nomination.
Two Netflix series tied HBO's "Chernobyl" with the most nominations on the TV side with four nods: "The Crown" and "Unbelievable." Netflix's "The Kominsky Method" and "The Politician" additionally landed best series, comedy or musical, nominations alongside Emmy favourites "Fleabag," from Amazon, and HBO's "Barry."
Led by "Succession," "Big Little Lies" and "Chernobyl," HBO still had a strong showing with 15 nods overall, second to Netflix's 17 television nominations -- even if the final season of "Game of Thrones" failed to make it into the best drama series category.
Montreal filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee's Crazyrose Productions is named in the "Big Little Lies" nomination. He directed the first season of the HBO series but not the second one, however he is an executive producer on the show.
But streaming services made greater inroads to one of Hollywood's premier parties than ever before, reflecting the industry's quickening realignment. Amazon had eight nominations in total, boosted by "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" and "Fleabag." The recently launched Apple TV Plus scored its first Globes nominations with "The Morning Show," including nods for Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Broadcast networks were shut out entirely.
But shed a tear for Baby Yoda. Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian" didn't make the cut.
Yet if the Globes nominations gave a snapshot of the changing media landscape, some saw a notable lack of progress in other areas. The press association again fielded an all-male directing category, nominating Scorsese, Tarantino, Bong Joon Ho ("Parasite"), Sam Mendes (whose World War I thriller "1917" was also nominated for best picture, drama) and Todd Phillips ("Joker").
Among those left out were Greta Gerwig ("Little Women"), Lulu Wang ("The Farewell") and Marielle Heller ("A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"). The Globes have only ever nominated five women for best director. At the 2017 awards, Natalie Portman pointedly introduced the category's "all-male nominees."
None of this year's 10 nominees for best picture were directed by women, either. Most notably overlooked was Gerwig's upcoming Louisa May Alcott adaptation "Little Women," which was nominated for Saoirse Ronan's lead performance and Alexandre Desplat's score. Adding to the trend was the omission, on the TV side, of Ava DuVernay's acclaimed Central Park Five miniseries "When They See Us."
Alma Ha'rel, director of the acclaimed "Honey Boy," writing on Twitter on Monday listed nine female filmmakers whose movies touched audiences, including Lorene Scafaria ("Hustlers") and Melina Matsoukas ("Queen & Slim"). She wrote: "That's our awards. No one can take that away."
In a statement, Ronan emphasized with her director: "My performance in this film belongs to Greta as much as it does to myself and I share the recognition completely with her."
The awards campaign of "Joker" got a lift Monday, also landing nods for best film, drama, and for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. With more than $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales, it's easily the biggest blockbuster to crash the Globes.
A handful of likely best-actress Oscar contenders nabbed a nomination, including Renee Zellweger ("Judy"), Charlize Theron ("Bombshell") and Cynthia Erivo ("Harriet"). Jennifer Lopez ("Hustlers") secured her expected nod for best supporting actress, as did Tom Hanks, for best supporting actor, for his Mister Rogers in "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
It was a good day for crowdpleasers, including Rian Johnson's star-studded whodunit "Knives Out" (best picture, comedy or musical; acting nods for Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas), the Elton John biopic "Rocketman" (best picture, comedy or musical; best actor for Taron Egerton); and the madcap Nazi Germany coming-of-age tale "Jojo Rabbit" (best picture, comedy or musical; best actor for its young star, Roman Griffin Davis). James Mangold's racing drama "Ford v Ferrari," though, could have used a bigger boost from the press association; it landed a sole nomination for Christian Bale.
"There are only two things I let interrupt my beauty sleep: fire alarms and the Golden Globes nominations," said "Jojo Rabbit" writer-director Taika Waititi. "Thank you HFPA for acknowledging that comedy can be a powerful tool against hate and supporting `Jojo Rabbit."'
The nominees for best foreign language film went to "The Farewell," which also earned a best actress earned for Awkwafina; Pedro Almodovar's "Pain and Glory," for which Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor; Bong's "Parasite"; Ladj Ly's French police thriller "Les Miserables"; and Celine Sciamma's period romance "Portrait of a Lady on Fire."
Several possible Academy Awards favourites weren't eligible in the Globes' top categories. Even though the press association is a group of foreign journalists based in Los Angeles, they don't nominate international films for best drama or best comedy/musical. That ruled out Bong's social satire "Parasite" (which the Los Angeles Film Critics Association voted the year's best on Sunday) and Wang's family drama "The Farewell." Both are expected to be in the Oscar mix.
"I was already aware of those regulations and I respect that every awards ceremony, they all have their own traditions, so for me foreign language film is best picture," Bong said by phone. ""Directors like Almodovar and Scorsese, who are nominated for best director, I've studied them since I was young, so just to be among them was an honour, regardless of the category. Because Almodovar is also only nominated for best foreign language film, it makes it an honour for me."
Vying for best animated feature are: "Frozen 2," "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World," "The Lion King," "Missing Link," and "Toy Story 4." The award wasn't necessarily one sought by "The Lion King." Disney has argued that Jon Favreau's remake, made largely with computer generated imagery, is live-action.
Dean DeBlois of Aylmer, Que., wrote and directed "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World," which is the final instalment in the Oscar-nominated animated film trilogy. Montreal-raised actor Jay Baruchel voices the lead character, a young Viking named Hiccup.
The Globes, with 87 voting members, differ wildly from the Academy Awards, which are decided by 9,000 industry professionals. But the press association's choices sometimes line up with the academy's, like last year when "Green Book" (entered as a comedy at the Globes) triumphed at both.
This year could give the Globes slightly more sway because the awards season is especially truncated. The Academy Awards are being held several weeks early, on Feb. 9, giving Oscar campaigns less time to find momentum.
Ricky Gervais will host the Globes, broadcast on NBC, for the fifth time on January 5. In addition to being a supporting acting nominee, Hanks will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award. The Carol Burnett Award will go to Ellen DeGeneres.
One movie that didn't scratch out much love Monday: "Cats." Press association members screened Tom Hooper's upcoming, much-memed adaptation of the Broadway musical but rewarded it with only a nod for the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Taylor Swift song "Beautiful Ghosts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lenny Bruce From ‘Marvelous Mrs Maisel’ Was a Real Comedian, and His Life Was as Drama-Filled as the Show Depicts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’stitular character, Midge, is fictional, but the New York City of the 1960s that she lives in is very, very real. The sights, the sounds, the Gaslight—they’re all representative of the city during that time. Another very real part of this show? Lenny Bruce (played on the show by Luke Kirby), Midge’s comedy BFF and the guy voted most likely to bail her out of jail. Lenny and Midge have a very unexpected friendship, and all the arrests and drama and controversy that Lenny Bruce found himself in the show also happened IRL. Here's what we know.
According to his website, Leonard Alfred Schneider was born on Long Island, in Mineola, New York, on October 13, 1925. (A Libra! Naturally!) His mother was an actress and stage performer and his dad was a shoe clerk—luckily, for the entirety of American culture, Lenny took after his mother and dedicated himself to a life on the stage.
His first controversial performance came when he dressed in drag for his naval shipmates when he was stationed in Italy during World War II. After an honorable discharge in 1945, Bruce moved to New York City to make it as a comedian, eventually settling on Lenny Bruce as his stage name. He spent years honing his act, and was, as his website says, dubbed a “sick” comedian because he didn’t shy away from ranting about religion, patriotism, race, drugs, abortions, you name it—he had strong opinions and he wasn’t about to be quiet about them.

Which ‘Maisel’ Characters Are Based on IRL People?
Bruce cleaned up his act for television appearances—that “All Alone” bit on The Steve Allen Show from Season 2 actually happened, and you can watch it on YouTube.
Bruce was arrested on obscenity charges in real life just as he was on Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. He was charged with violating obscenity laws all over the world, and that speech he gave Midge at the end of Season 1 talking about all the money he’s giving lawyers? That was true, too, because he had run out of places that would allow him to play. In 1964, he was arrested, charged, and brought to trial on an obscenity charge in New York City following a particularly dirty set at Cafe Au Go Go.
Ephraim London, then one of the country’s best First Amendment lawyers, represented Bruce, who was ultimately convicted (although he was posthumously pardoned by Governor George Pataki in 2003). By 1966, Bruce couldn’t find anywhere to play because no club wanted to deal with being slapped with an obscenity charge for hosting his act.
Bruce struggled with addiction, and he died on August 3, 1966, following an accidental morphine overdose in his Los Angeles home. He’s buried in Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.
Right now, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is set at the beginning of the 1960s, so there are a handful of years to go before Bruce’s death. As Bruce is such a central character on the show at the moment (according to Vanity Fair, Bruce’s daughter, Kitty, visited the set of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel to help Kirby in playing her father), it will be particularly sad to watch Midge’s star rise while Bruce’s starts to fall.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple TV Plus goes head to head with Netflix
(Image credit: Apple )
If the goal of Apple TV Plus was to achieve critical recognition, then it has succeeded; Apple's streaming platform has been given its first awards nomination just over a month after its launch (in November 2019). 
Billy Crudup of The Morning Show, Apple TV Plus' flagship series, has been nominated for a Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, pitting him against the likes of Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage and Tim Blake Nelson of Watchmen. 
The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carrell, and Reese Witherspoon, examines the complicated power dynamics between men and women in a bustling morning news show, amid a scandal concerning Carrell's character. 
Securing an awards nomination within weeks of launch is undoubtably impressive, but Apple TV Plus is still firmly in the shadow of Netflix, which has dominated the Critics' Choice Awards nominations list. 
In fact, 14 nominations alone are for the Martin Scorsese epic, The Irishman, with debuted on Netflix in late November.
Netflix will no doubt be hoping that The Irishman rakes in the awards over the coming months; a reported $160 million budget (much of which was spent on de-aging its cast with impressive visual effects) makes it one of the streaming platform's most expensive ventures. 
Other Netflix Critics' Choice nominees include The Crown (Best Drama Series), One Day at a Time (Best Comedy Series), and El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (Best Movie Made For Television). 
While Netflix is raking in far more nominations that Apple TV Plus, it's worth remembering that the streaming platform had to wait years before it was taken seriously by critics.
Fellow streaming newcomer Disney Plus, didn't receive any nominations for original shows like Star Wars spin-off, The Mandalorian.
That Apple has managed to do it in mere weeks is testament both to the quality of its shows, and the increasing authority of streaming platforms as content creators, as well as curators.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nagarjuna, Chiranjeevi, S S Rajamouli support the fifth Film Preservation and Restoration Workshop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Film Preservation and Restoration Workshop 2019 began in Hyderabad with a formal inauguration on Sunday evening that witnessed the presence of several A-listers from Telugu cinema. The fifth in its series of workshops conducted by Film Heritage Foundation (FHF) and the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) in collaboration with Martin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation (TFF), Adobe Inc, Tata Trust, Viacom 18 and others, the week-long workshop will have participating students learning the technicalities of film and photography restoration and preservation. The workshop is on in the vicinity of Annapurna College of Film & Media.
Filmmaker and the founder-director of FHF, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, is pleased with the response from the Telugu film industry towards the workshop, and film preservation in the larger scheme of things. He reveals that so far, film negatives of nearly 50 to 55 movies from Akkineni Nageswara Rao’s family members and Prasad Labs are being worked upon for restoration and preservation. “We have conducted the workshop in other cities before. What makes the Hyderabad workshop special is the interest shown by superstars like Akkineni Nagarjuna and Chiranjeevi; both of them came forward to attend a few sessions and understand the art of film restoration,” he says.
Shivendra reveals that Annapurna Studios is eager that all the film negatives of ANR, Nagarjuna and others be restored and preserved. The Foundation has worked on archival photographic material of Ramanaidu Studios and is in talks with other production houses and labs. “This one-week workshop is just the beginning. It’s heartening when people like (producer) Shobu Yarlagadda and director Rajamouli tell us that they want to come and know what happens in the workshop,” says Shivendra.
The applications for those who want to learn the basic or advanced preservation and restoration workshops was announced earlier this year and the chosen candidates are now being taught by the best of international faculty. Some of the faculty members who are in the city for the workshop includes photo conservationist Nora Kennedy representing Metropolitan Museum of Art, Rob Byrne of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, and David Walsh of FIAF, among many others.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nick Cannon Calls Out Kim, Hailie & Alaina On Suge Knight-Led Eminem Diss Track 'The Invitation'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles, CA – The nonstop war of words between Eminem and Nick Cannon has just elevated to yet another level.
Following Slim Shady’s latest retort towards the Power 106 radio host’s family via Fat Joe’s “Lord Above,” Cannon has fired back his own shots with his new diss record “The Invitation” — and he didn’t mince words.
“Call Kim, somebody get Hailie/And that other kid you raisin’ that ain’t even your baby (Daddy)/Took a page out of Drake book/This might get a Grammy/We going back to back ’til you respond on the family,” Cannon spewed on the track, a direct jab at his famous foe’s family members.
The Hitmaka-produced diss also features contributions from Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips and Prince Eazy, as well as an instigating intro from none other than the incarcerated former music mogul, Suge Knight, who risked getting a demerit with his vulgar phone time.
“Eminem’s a bitch,” Knight, who is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence for manslaughter, quips during the opening soundscape.
On the aforementioned record “Lord Above,” Eminem unleashed a lyrical fury in Cannon’s direction when he spit, “I know me and Mariah didn’t end on a high note/But that other dude’s whipped, that pussy got him neutered/Tryna tell him his chicks a nut ‘fore he got his jewels clipped/Almost got my caboose kicked/Fool, quit, you not gon’ do shit/I let her chop my balls off too before I lost to you, Nick.”
Cannon initially felt the insults weren’t worthy of a response but during his official reaction to the track, listeners could see the emotions brewing, hence “The Invitation” was born.
Listen to Cannon’s latest comeback above and read the lyrics below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wonder Woman 1984 first trailer: Gal Gadot is back – this time with Kristen Wiig</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“We wanted to bring Wonder Woman into the modern world,” Patty Jenkins said before introducing the first trailer for Wonder Woman 1984, her new film, at CCXP, the Comic Con Experience convention in Brazil, on Sunday.
The 2017 film Wonder Woman was largely set during the first World War, but as the title superheroine, played by Gal Gadot, is immortal, she doesn’t appear to have aged in the sequel, set during the cold war. How her love interest, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) – who died, or seemed to, in the previous movie – figures in the new story remains a mystery, but he’s prominently featured in the trailer. “I promise you it’s not a gimmick,” Jenkins told fans at CCXP. “He’s integral to the story.”
The clip also focuses on a pair of new characters: Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal), a ruthless infomercial king, and Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who starts out as a friend of Wonder Woman’s alter ego, Diana Prince, but transforms into the villainous Cheetah.
Wonder Woman shows off some of her signature moves in the trailer, batting away bullets with her bracelets and throwing her golden lasso. She also shows off a new look: an all-gold suit that features a pair of wings. – New York Times
Wonder Woman 1984 is scheduled to hit cinemas on June 5th, 2020

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reggie's Game Awards Appearance With Xbox And PlayStation Bosses Almost Didn't Happen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the highlights of last year's Game Awards was right at the very beginning of the show, as Nintendo of America's president at the time, Reggie Fils-Aimé, shared the stage with Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and ex-PlayStation boss Shawn Layden. It was a humbling display of solidarity between gaming's major rivals, something which has made its way into games themselves in the form of a rise in cross-platform play.
As it happens, though, the special moment wasn't a particularly easy one to create. The show's host and creator Geoff Keighley recently spoke with fans on Reddit, answering their questions on this year's upcoming event. He revealed that it took "months of negotiations", and that just days before the show he thought it wasn't going to happen at all.
Here's the moment in question if you need a reminder:
In the very same Reddit session, Keighley also announced that this year's show - taking place later this week - will reveal "around 10 new games". It might be worth a watch.
Do you remember this taking place last year? Would you like to see Nintendo of America's new president, Doug Bowser, take the stage this year? Tell us below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Trick Lets You Defeat Calamity Ganon With Just One Hit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We often describe The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as the game that keeps on giving, with new tricks, glitches, speedrun revelations and plenty more besides still regularly being found almost three years since the game first launched. Today, we have another one to share with you, and this one's a biggie.
As you'd expect, the game's final boss, Calamity Ganon, isn't usually the easiest of foes to take down. With one very precisely timed pull on your bow, however, that can all change.
The video below shows the trick in action; essentially, shooting an Ancient Arrow just before Ganon's cutscene begins will finish him off the moment the battle begins. Check it out (the arrow is fired at the very beginning, and Ganon suddenly falls to his doom as soon as the fight starts at around 3:20):
So why on Earth does that happen? Well, according to the video's creator, Gaming Reinvented, it would appear that bosses can take damage during cutscenes. We imagine this was completely unintentional on Nintendo's part, but characters - including Link - seem to take continuous damage during cutscenes. So that single arrow was slowly but surely taking away Ganon's health the whole time.
Here's another example, this time against Windblight Ganon. Notice how he just explodes the moment the fight begins.
That certainly makes things easier, huh?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The finalists for this year's I'm a Celebrity were barely out of the jungle before rumours started about their successors in 2020.
And it was a big name who joked that he would be willing to appear in 12 months' time.
Robbie Williams teased that he hopes to bag a record appearance fee of millions to sign up for next year.
Appearing on Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show on ITV, Robbie chatted to jungle hosts Ant & Dec via video link.
The one-time X Factor judge asked: "What about the next series? Any guests lined up?"
He jokingly added: "So a really famous singer will get paid millions for going on I'm A Celeb right?"
He added: "Those bugs are so disgusting but I am going to eat them anyway to make really good prime time television."
Pushing to be invited, he added: "Boys what do you say?
"How am I looking for the next series?"
Robbie is used to slimming down and explained all about his recent weight loss - and how he has keeps the pounds off.
"When I smoke, I'm half smoke, half man," he said. "I'm a man of extremes. And the wife said, you got to give up smoking. January the 1st. And in May, that sounded like a good deal.
"And also, I didn't want to do the death, the early death. So I was like, yeah, OK. Then it got to November. And I was like, remember January the 1st?
“And I just thought, hang on, maybe I can just view this differently.
"This whole process, not only could I give up smoking, but I could be fit and healthy and have a clean head and a clean vision of how I want my future. And I found that moment to be very, very powerful."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who is I’m A Celebrity…. winner Jacqueline Jossa?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">She defeated Andrew Whyment in the final.
Jacqueline Jossa shot to fame as Lauren Branning in EastEnders, but has hit the headlines in recent years for her personal life.
The actress is married to former The Only Way Is Essex star Dan Osborne, with whom she has two daughters, Ella, four, and Mia, one.
The pair briefly split last year, less than 12 months after getting married, but reconciled after Osborne took part in Celebrity Big Brother just over a year ago.
Jossa joined EastEnders in 2010 and played the role in 2018, taking over from Madeline Duggan.
It was announced she was leaving the BBC soap in 2017, alongside her on-screen sister Lorna Fitzgerald and her last scenes aired in February 2018.
Before she went in the jungle, she said she expected her former co-stars to be surprised she was taking part.
She said: “I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat.
“I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best.”
Jossa and Osborne have been tabloid fixtures amid rumours of his infidelity.
While they were in the jungle, her campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly claimed to her that Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.
Osborne and Allen were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.
After the reports emerged, Osborne tweeted: “No matter how much they try breaking us, we are and will always remain a team. Keep smashing it in that jungle and I can not wait to see you when you get out @jacquelineMjos.”
Jossa said the most difficult part of being in I’m A Celebrity was being herself rather than acting a role, as she has never done that before.
Before she went on the show, she said: “My old colleagues on EastEnders are going to be shocked,” she said. “I don’t think they can imagine me in there. I don’t like creatures. It is not my thing.”
Asked how it would feel to win, she said: “Obviously I would love to win but you don’t go into it wanting to.
“This is one of those shows where you come out feeling proud of what you have done. If doing this programme opens doors for me then that would be so exciting.
“There are loads of things I would love to do, both acting and presenting.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year's annual "WestJet Christmas Miracle" video showcases families as they decide whether to give or receive.
The video was filmed at a Christmas market in Toronto where guests were given the opportunity to enter a giant Santa hat.
The video showcases a holographic Blue Santa along with Ebenezer Scrooge as they let families decide to give away or walk away with the gifts they find.
“The conversation around giving and receiving is a powerful one, and this year’s video finds inspiration in both sides of the story,” said Richard Bartrem, WestJet vice-president of marketing communications.
“The authentic reactions and emotions ... make this year’s Christmas Miracle truly heartwarming.”
The gifts included a $2,500 WestJet gift card, beach vacations and more, and the choice was left up to the people to either keep the gift or give it to a family with sick children who are staying at a Ronald McDonald House.
Touching moments were captured, and Santa made it clear there were no wrong answers.
Those who gave away their gifts were invited to a celebration at the Ronald McDonald House in Hamilton, Ont.
"For over 10 years, our incredible partners at WestJet have helped us keep families from across Canada close together during a very difficult time in their lives,” said Cathy Loblaw, CEO of RMHC Canada.
“We are so humbled by the generosity of Canadian families who chose to donate their gifts to Ronald McDonald House families this holiday season, giving them the greatest gift of all – family.”
The magical holographs in the video were created by ARHT Media Inc.

Adding Personal Perspective To Interactive Travel Literature
Wanderlust Travel Stories is an anthology of interactive travel literature we published in fall 2019, and it’s the first release of our small studio called Different Tales. Before going indie, my business partner Jacek and I worked in lead roles on both AAA and mobile titles, and applying the things we learned over the last dozen years to our own product was an experience both fascinating and humbling.
In this article, I’ll share how we used context and personal perspective to make choices relevant for the player and easier to implement.
In May 2018 we decided to make a story game about travel. We wanted to keep it real, introspective and minimalistic.
To make a game grounded in real experiences we took on board a team of travel journalists, writers, and anthropologists, and put a lot of effort into research, interviews, photographic documentation, etc. This gave us a solid framework for the story, but also limited the possible choice-space.
We wanted to show not the, sometimes boring, logistics of travel but, above all, the feelings and emotions of a traveler. To do this we constructed a cast of characters representing very different ideas about traveling and wrote a collection of stories from their personal perspectives—a kind of interactive memoirs.
Wanderlust Travel Stories is a literary experience, and we made sure nothing distracts you away from the text. The static photos and illustrative soundscapes are there just to bring back memories or stir your imagination. The user interface is also very basic, its most important elements are stress, fatigue, and mood—showing the emotional state of the character and its influence on the story. This mechanism is described in the next sections of this text.
In the heart of every good scene is a dilemma the hero must face. By observing the hero in action we learn who they really are. The action changes the situation and creates consequences, often resulting in another dilemma.
What makes games unique, is that the designers set up a dilemma, but it is the player who makes the decision and is responsible for who the hero turns out to be. To make an informed choice the player has to be able to imagine possible outcomes. In well-written stories, the player can also compare the projected consequences with what really happened, and learn.
If this topic interests you, I wholeheartedly recommend John Yorke’s book Into the Woods, on how the learning process in our brain coexist with and shapes the stories we tell.
If we stick to the above-mentioned rules, every scene should include such elements:
If we want to make the story interactive, the first thing that usually comes to mind is to present more options. But they branch into many consequences, exponentially exploding the story tree. There are many industry standards to deal with the problem (ex. this great article by Emily Short), and we knew that we needed something very streamlined. Our time, budget and research, gave us a very tight set of constraints. We decided to focus less on shaping the world, and more on experiencing it.
That brings us to a crucial element of any decision-making process: context. Do you want a glass of water? There are two simple ways to answer, to default options: yes and no. Yet the answer would heavily depend on whether you are in a desert, dying of thirst, or on an important meeting, and really needing to go to the loo. There are moments when the context is everything.
So, we decided to highlight the subjective and personal nature of travel, to modify and multiply rather the contexts than the options. To do this, we reached for emotions.
As many travelers would tell you, sometimes the world is what it is, but usually emotions color the perception. When tired or stressed you experience the world differently.
Wanting to show how stress and fatigue influence how we feel about the places we visit, we implemented a very simple emotional simulator. It was based on a model described in Christophe André’s book about moods called "Les États d'âme : Un apprentissage de la sérénité."
We simplified the model a bit, and this is how it works in Wanderlust Travel Stories:
The player’s decisions, apart from branching the story from time to time, usually influenced stress and fatigue. The resulting mood was being fed back to the story, modifying the context of every following decision.
The idea was to have every scene opening and summary written in at least three (up to nine) versions, reflecting the character’s possible moods. The more important the scene was to the main story arc, the higher emotional fidelity it had. Additionally, some options were available only in certain moods. We did not always manage to do that, but that was what we aimed for.
As an example, I chose a scene in Paris, one that is not spoilery and designed well enough to dissect in the public. Our hero steps off the train and has his first experience with the capital of France. What he sees and what options are available depends on his stress and fatigue.
The way players approach the available options, depends on the context they were given, or at least that was the idea behind the design.
When the character is peaceful, he sees Paris “as it is,” just another European city near a train station. The main choice in this scene is how to proceed, whether to take a taxi or walk. Because Tomek is fatigued, an extra option appears “I was hungry.” We can expect that most players will eat something (to regain some strength) and then decide whether to walk or call a taxi.
The situation changes when the character is hopeless. High stress and high fatigue render the world hostile, and the character focus on possible dangers: drunks, shouting, a reeking dumpster. The main call-a-taxi-or-walk choice remains the same, and there are two extra options: “I was hungry,” and “I needed a drink,” the later triggered by high stress. Eating is still a valid option gameplay-wise, but in the presence of a smelly dumpster, many players lose their appetite and just call a taxi to get out of that awful place.
When a character is calm the place looks normal and the choice boils down to picking the best way to proceed. Curious players will probably take a walk, while the “optimizers” would probably call a taxi to save their strength for the future.
An optimistic character sees the city in its most glamorous form, full of light and excitement. It looks inviting, making the taxi seem like a less interesting choice.
The graph of the scene looks like this:
As far as the branching goes, the situation is quite simple—we make a decision, and at the end of the scene we either walk down one branch or sit in a taxi going down another branch of the story tree. Sometimes there are extra diversions available, in the form of short scenes in a bar and/or in a bistro, but they feed back to the main choice.
But when we look at the mood-dependent contexts, the situation gets more interesting. Although the number of outcomes stays the same, the number of personal situations framing the decision multiply. Taking a taxi to escape a hostile environment is a different decision than giving up on an otherwise alluring walk to save strength for another day. A quick snack before a night stroll is something different than a forced meal in a dive near a smelly dumpster.
We learned the nuances of this technique as we went, so not all instances you’ll find in the game, work perfectly, but we found it a great production tool. It allowed us to save on extensive (and expensive) branching we were prone to, and to keep the story within our research-based limits, while allowing for extensive personalization of the events. We set most scenes in the mood-depending context, and as a result, the number of personal decision-making situations available to players became much higher than the actual scene count.
The mood simulator was just a specific, and the most universal, case when we used variables to personalize the story. In short, it worked like this: the main decision in a scene branched the story, but some of the decisions also changed a variable value (be it fatigue, the strength of a relationship with another character, or just noting that a certain event took place). The variable then fed back to scenes down the story-tree, no matter which of the branches we explored.
We used this simple and effective mechanism both to personalize small details of the stories and to decide about the outcomes of whole character arcs.
The details can be as small as whether Henriette is a tea or a coffee person. The first choice the player makes about their favorite beverage reflects on the whole long sailing to Antarctica—with a steaming cup of tea (or coffee) in hand. Sometimes the changes are about people. Depending on how the player directs Adília’s relation with her husband, she talks about him using his name “Jose” or coldly calls him “the husband.” The mechanism is crucial in the story’s finale, when the available options that shape Adília’s future, are gated by variables reflecting her relationships with various people in her life.
We wanted to tell stories that were real and personal, and we knew that we would be working in a small team and within the limits set by our research. Those factors advised against extensive branching of the story (which was our first idea), yet we wanted to keep the experience varied among different players, and we wanted it to feel personal.
The solution we reached for, was to use the player’s decision points not only to branch the story but also to set different variables, which then fed back to the following scenes, modifying them to reflect how the player directed the character.
The most universal and crucial of the variables, were stress and fatigue, which we used to track the mood of the characters. The mood then influenced how surroundings were described, providing changing and personal context for every decision. Thanks to this, using a limited number of story branching points, we aimed to create a significantly higher number of unique decision situations.
We learned how to use the mechanisms as the production progressed, so the implementation is not perfect, but we believed the idea was interesting enough to share it with you.
If you have similar (or totally different) experiences from your productions, I would love to share stories.
And, while you're here, you might be interested in my post on Slow Gaming, a philosophy we try to put in motion in our games.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Fury marked the start of his sizzling spa day by stripping off for a half-naked snap.
The Love Island runner up, 21, left little to the imagination as he shared a cheeky photo with his 2.9 million Instagram followers on Sunday afternoon.
The professional boxer appeared to be enjoying a relaxing day in the spa, and it seems he wanted to show off his extremely toned physique and bulging muscles - sending pulses racing.
The hunky reality star is currently preparing for his highly-anticipated return to the ring after he took to social media to announce his comeback fight with a video captioned: "Are you ready 21.12.19."
The fight, with his opponent still unknown, will take place at the Copper Box Arena in London on 'The Fight Before Christmas' card on BT Sport.
Tommy's latest snap proves the TV star has been training hard in the gym with his chiseled six pack, defined shoulders and huge biceps stealing the photo's attention.
He captioned the snap, writing: "Spa nights."
The handsome star's Love Island girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague complimented her beau's recent snap with a hint of PDA as she took to Instagram to post on his pic.
Teasing her approval of Tommy's snap, the blonde bombshell, 20, replied: "Wowwww."
Meanwhile, Tommy's saucy snap also caught the attention of his fellow Love Island contestant Michel Griffiths.
The former firefighter, 28, recognised Tommy's gym success, commenting: "Abs coming through there son."
Tommy's post-Love Island schedule has been hectic, with the star also busy filming for The Boxer & the Ballroom Dancer, alongside best pal Curtis Pritchard .
Love Island 2019's favourite mates have teamed up for a new spin-off of the hit ITV2 show which sees the boys switch their day jobs, and it will consist of three 60-minute episodes which highlight their unbreakable bromance.
Curtis, 23, will put on the boxing gloves as Tommy learns to cut some moves on the dancefloor.
As a surprise, their girlfriends Maura Higgins and Molly-Mae will star in the series along the way as they root for their boyfriends with support.
*The Boxer & the Ballroom Dancer will air on ITV2 later this year.

Weeks after having gushed about her excitement for their big day in September 2020, Danielle spoke of her heartache.
"It isn't just cancelling a wedding, it's saying goodbye to the vision you had for the rest of your life after that day," she wrote.
"The venue, the laughter, the family members and the start of a journey with someone who you love and who will love you for the rest of your life, no matter what, for better or worse. The places you would live and the things you would see together."
She went on: "I am not posting this for sympathy but for my own closure. I’m saying goodbye to the girl in this dress, I’m saying goodbye to her for good. It's been pretty traumatising for me having to come to terms with everything lol but I'm only looking forward from now on. God has a different plan for my life - I hope the next chapter is the best one yet."
As fans flocked to ask what went wrong, Danielle returned to her caption to add: "The details are between Jonny & I. We have some amazing beautiful memories together which I will always cherish and I wish him nothing but happiness and success with everything he does in his life."
But a pal told Mirror Online Danielle had been worried that Jonny, also 28, had been cheating on her behind her back.
"She's utterly heartbroken. She's already moved out of the home they bought together," said the source.
"She had to cancel the wedding - they couldn't go on like this. She's done with their relationship, there's no hope of a reconciliation whatsoever.
"He's just not the man she thought he was."
The couple found love in February 2018, after Jonny's messy split from Stephanie Pratt.
Danielle, who was previously in a relationship with TOWIE's Elliott Wright, confirmed they were engaged in December last year, after Jonny popped the question during a romantic break in Switzerland.
"It sounds clichè, but I knew from the first time I met this girl that I was going to marry her," Jonny wrote on Instagram to announce the news.
"I probably would've proposed to her within the first month of knowing her if it wasn't totally weird! She's basically the girl version of me and gets me in every way humanly possible.. She's a beautiful, caring soul inside and out."
Since their split, believed to be at the end of November, Jonny has been sharing snaps of himself lapping up the sun in Bali and boarding a private jet.
"My ideal New years' resolution 2020: 1. Jet off to a remote island in the middle of nowhere. 2. Never come back," he wrote cryptically earlier this month.
Mirror Online has contacted Jonny's rep for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jacqueline Jossa and Dan Osborne get very close hours after jungle win despite threesome slurs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jacqueline Jossa and her hunky husband Dan Osborne looked super cosy on the beach after she was crowned the Queen of the Jungle.
The pair shrugged off all circulating rumours of Dan's infidelity to his former EastEnders actress wife.
Former Towie star Dan, 28, was pictured making his wife, 27, laugh while he goes in for a hug after the pair were apart for three weeks.
They enjoyed some family time with their children on a very crowded and busy beach.
Jac looked stunning in a frilly floral print dress and her long brunette hair falling over her shoulders, while Dan got his abs out and went shirtless to show off his tattooed body.
He was seen cupping her face in one snap and leaning in towards her for what looks like a cheeky kiss.
It comes after the couple - who have been married just over two years - faced trouble after threesome slurs.
Model Chloe Ayling came forward to say she had a threesome with Dan and CBB star Natalie Nunn after a wild night out.
The model said she wanted to confess because she felt bad for Dan's wife Jacqueline who will be unaware of the new claims.
She claimed to The Sun that after a night of boozing and partying - which saw the stars papped together - they went back to a hotel and engaged in sexual activity together.
Chloe claims that she watched Dan have full sex with Natalie, who was married to Jacob at the time, before kissing and performing a sex act on Chloe.
Dan has also faced a number of cheating claims in the past, including rumours that he hooked up with former Love Island babe Gabby Allen , but he has always protested his innocence, as has Gabby.
It has also been reported that Myles told Jacqueline in unaired scenes that he believed something had happened between his ex-girlfriend Gabby and Dan.
He recently told us: "I've got nothing to worry about.
"Listen, she is my wife, I have got nothing to think about. I am just coming out to support her and that is the only reason I am here.
"I am just excited to see her and the last person on my mind is Myles [Stephenson] or anyone else. I have got nothing to say to him or anything else, only my wife."

    <h5 class="mb-1">EastEnders confirms first look at Lee Carter return as disaster strikes Walford</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EastEnders has confirmed details about Lee Carter's big return to Walford, over two years on from his exit from the BBC soap.
Actor Danny Hatchard is reprising the role for a guest stint, as part of on-screen mum Linda Carter's devastating new storyline.
Linda's battle with alcohol will escalate in the coming scenes, leaving her in danger - and leaving her family including husband Mick distraught.
As she continues to act out, unable to stop drinking, she ends up clashing with residents including Ruby Allen.
But when the character goes missing, her family including son Lee are worried.
On Christmas Eve, Linda will head out of the pub to the Square gardens where she drinks alone.
Falling asleep in the freezing conditions, will she be okay?
It comes after Mick's attempts to stop his wife drinking leave her exploding at him.
The following day she hits rock bottom, while it's clear she doesn't return to the pub as the Carters panic.
As the day goes on with Linda nowhere to be seen, her family grow seriously worried for her.
Lee makes his return unaware of the unfolding situation at first, making his comeback for the festive period.
But events soon take their toll, with Mick suffering from a panic attack.
Recent spoilers confirmed Linda would "spiral dangerously out of control" this Christmas, leaving her in a desperate situation.
There was also pictures from filming on location, that appeared to show the character being kidnapped by Martin Fowler, who was shown waving a gun around.
No details about the storyline have been confirmed, so viewers will have to stay tuned.
EastEnders airs Mondays an Fridays at 8pm, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity's Roman Kemp 'knew' Jacqueline Jossa would win after 'wobble'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa had it in the bag from day five, according to her campmate Roman Kemp.
Roman finished in third place on the series on Sunday, with Jacqueline being crowned Queen of the Jungle.
But it was no surprise to Roman that the EastEnders star went all the way to victory.
In fact, he predicted it on day five and secretly told Jacqueline she could win it after she considered quitting the show.
After a "wobble" in camp, with the first few days being extremely tough, Roman urged her to stay in the jungle.
Speaking on Lorraine on Monday morning, Roman confessed: "I said to her from day five!
"She had a bit of a wobble and was missing home. She'd come back from Snake Rock and had been sleeping on the floor.
"I gave her a hug and pulled her aside, cos I didn't want the others to hear, and I whispered in her ear, 'If you can stay you’ll win it, you will'."
Roman then confessed that when the winner was announced, the pair looked at each other with him telling her "I told you".
It comes after the news that Jacqueline has skipped all live TV interviews in the wake of her win.
Jacqueline has chosen to spend time with her family, amid filming with ITV for the Coming Out show this week.
A source close to Jacqueline told Mirror Online: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.
"Jacqueline and Dan spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."
Runner-up Andy Whyment also discussed Jacqueline's win on the show, sharing she had a "tough time" in the jungle.
Andy commented that she was doing "fine" since arriving back at the hotel, pleased for her taking the crown.
I'm A Celebrity's Coming Out show airs Thursday night at 9pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scottish war artist Peter Howson unveils new work to commemorate massacre in Bosnia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Scottish artist Peter Howson, who is best known for his haunting images of the war in Bosnia, has created a new work depicting a mass genocide which claimed the lives of more than 8000 men and boys.
The Massacre of Srebrenica will be on display at the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art in Glasgow for the next three years after being created by the painter to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Europe’s biggest mass murder after the Second World War.
Howson, who was Britain’s official war artist during the civil war in Bosnia, said today he was still haunted by scenes he could only describe as “hell on earth.”
The Glasgow School of Art graduate was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum to produce work in the former Yugoslavia. Much of his work then has addressed themes of conflict, destruction, human suffering and redemption.
The 61-year-old, who has spoken previously about the impact his experiences had on his mental health and the eventual break-up of his marriage, said his new painting was intended to capture “a moment in Europe’s history.”Glasgow Museums chiefs hope that the public display of the painting will help younger generations “recognise the signs of intolerance and the violence it generates.
Howson said: “It is difficult to put into words the horror of the massacre of over 8,000 men and boys in the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian civil war. I was there as a war artist during this time and witnessed what I can only describe as hell on earth.
"The experience caused me many years of illness and the breakup of my family. I still have memories too painful to talk about, but painting these terrible events helps me to try and understand why we do such evil things to each other.
"This painting records a moment in European history; a memory in my mind’s eye of what happened that day. It portrays people who are dead and people, many of whom are young boys, ready to die.
"I tried to capture the fear on their faces and the twisting contortions of bodies awaiting execution with a bullet. Very little film of the prelude to death is recorded. It would have been different if it happened today in the age of the smartphone.
"The perpetrators show no emotion, just a will to get the job done. The beauty of the countryside is a chilling juxtaposition to the horror of the scene.
"The whole thing is witnessed by a little girl who has climbed a tree. There is not much more you can say. Did the soldiers really believe they were pleasing their God by doing this?"
Howson unveiled his new painting alongside his depiction of Jesus as a homeless man, which he created in 2018 in response to a sculpture by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz for St George’s Tron Parish Church in Glasgow.
Howson, from Prestwick, in Ayrshire, said his portrayal of Jesus was intended to show the isolation and loneliness of a “champion to the outcast and friend of the homeless.”
Harry Dunlop, learning and access curator with Glasgow Museums, said: "War and persecution motivated by religious and ethnic hatred continues to force hundreds of thousands of people from their homelands.
‘St Mungo Museum’s founding principle is to further understanding and respect between people of different faiths and those of none.
"We are hugely indebted to Peter Howson for loaning this extremely powerful and challenging painting to Glasgow Museums.
"It hangs in the museum's most prominent space because we hope it, together with other works on show, will raise awareness of the need to recognise prejudice, extremism and exclusion and the hatred it creates, and ultimately take action to end it.
"Peter’s work is difficult to look at, but that is the point of having it at St Mungos. We must continue to learn from past atrocities and ensure younger generations know how to recognise the signs of intolerance and the violence it generates wherever in the world it occurs and take action to stop it."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Who doesn't like a free PlayStation 4 theme every now and again? This one almost completely passed us by, but it's always worth checking these freebies out. Activision has released a new dynamic theme, focusing on the main characters of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. It's available to download now in Europe and North America, and it'll cost you zero pennies.
As you can see from the above clip, it's pretty straightforward. Some cool character art is paired with the game's moody music in this basic dynamic theme. Not bad for a freebie, right?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Have you ever played a Five Nights at Freddy's game?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five Nights at Freddy's really falls into that "single developer" category that's been so prevalent in the 2010s.
Scott Cawthon is responsible for a multi-million-dollar empire, alongside of recent solo studio names like Matt Thorson, Toby Fox and Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. It really is amazing when you think about it, but a recent string of Switch eShop releases got me thinking: how much of the general public plays Five Nights?
Me? I like to dabble in a bit of everything. Some of it's for research, and the rest I just have no excuse: I love games of all shapes and sizes. Also, I have young cousins and neighbors who constantly ask me if I play it (and Minecraft/Fortnite/Roblox) so I like to have an answer ready.
You've probably seen the merch at some point (or the above Fazbear/friends face), but let us know if you've ever played a Five Nights game before.

On December 9 KST, the two singers dropped the music video for the song "First Winter," a sentimental love song reflecting the emotions of a couple celebrating their first Christmas together. The music video follows a couple separately making their way through scenic parts of Seoul before meeting up in front of a large illuminated Christmas tree in the center of town to exchange wrapped gifts.
The single is the second time the two artists have collaborated together, having previously released the duet "It's You" together back in 2010.
Meanwhile, Sung Si Kyung will be holding encore performances of his 2019 'Song' concert on December 20 and 21 at Jamsil Arena in Seoul.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crisis: Watch Every DC Cameo from Part 1 of the Arrowverse Crossover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"Crisis on Infinite Earths" viewers anxious to see the various cameo appearances from DC characters didn't have to wait very long once the event began.
Part one of the Arrowverse crossover aired on Sunday's episode of Supergirl, and the introduction wasted little time delivering the promised appearances. After a short recap featuring the Arrowverse's known characters, the cameos began rolling. The first to appear is Robert Wuhl reprising his role as newspaper reporter Alexander Knox from the 1989 Batman film. The world is appropriately designated as Earth-89.
Next up is Curran Walters and Alan Ritchson as Jason Todd/Robin and Hank Hall/Hawk, respectively, from Earth-9 -- home of DC Universe's Titans streaming series. Russell Tovey, as The Ray from Earth-X, follows. The character appeared as a member of the Freedom Fighters on last season's "Crisis on Earth-X" event.
One of the most anticipated appearances wraps up the intro, showing Burt Ward as a civilian Dick Grayson, albeit in a Robin-colored sweater, exclaiming "Holy crimson skies of death!" as crimson skies do indeed descend on, what else, Earth-66 -- home of the 1966 Batman TV series.
The anti-matter wave that inevitably comes in the wake of the sinister looking skies appears to claim Earth-9 and Earth-X specifically, so further appearances from those characters are unlikely.
"Crisis on Infinite Earths" continues in Batwoman on Monday, Dec. 9, and then picks up in The Flash on Tuesday, Dec. 10. After a winter hiatus, the crossover concludes on Tuesday, Jan. 14 on both Arrow and DC's Legends of Tomorrow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Steven Universe Future Reveals Pink Diamond Was Even Worse Than We Thought</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WARNING: The following contains spoilers for the Steven Universe Future episode "Volleyball."
It's been obvious to longtime Steven Universe viewers that Pink Diamond/Rose Quartz was a complicated character, to say the least. While she was the beloved leader of the Crystal Gems, she was also a manipulative liar who kept humans in zoos and cruelly abandoned friends. The Steven Universe Future episode "Volleyball" contains even bigger revelations about her sordid past and the crimes she never answered for but her loved ones now have the burden of dealing with.
Simply put, Pink Diamond was a domestic abuser. That isn't even presented through the guise of some sort of fantasy metaphor like most of the other times Steven Universe has dealt with upsetting adult themes. Pink had a horrible temper (something already hinted at in the dream sequence in "Jungle Moon"), and she would beat up her original Pearl so badly that not even Steven's healing spit can heal her physically manifesting psychological wounds.

The Crystal Gems' Pearl had a very different, and mostly more positive, relationship with Pink/Rose. If Pink couldn't control her emotions around her original Pearl (whom Steven nicknames "Volleyball" in this episode for ease of distinguishing between the two), she was too secretive and emotionally withholding around her later Pearl. Because of this, Pearl initially doesn't believe Volleyball's claims, and their argument frustrates Steven so much that, with his newly activating powers, he accidentally traps the two Pearls in a regenerator, a scary parallel for how his mother could "accidentally" brutalize others in her anger.
Trapped together, Pearl apologizes to Volleyball for disbelieving her, accepting that just because she knew one side of Pink/Rose doesn't mean she couldn't have behaved different at other times with other people. Together, they escape the regenerator by forming a giant fusion. It's notable that the Pearl fusion is designed to look like a fusion between Utena and Anthy from Revolutionary Girl Utena, an anime about overcoming abuse that's been a significant influence on Steven Universe.
Volleyball's story is only the most dramatic example of Pink Diamond's big, consistent problem of treating other intelligent beings as lesser-than and disposable. Beating up Volleyball, abandoning Spinel and enslaving humans are  different examples of her exhibiting the same pathology as the other Diamonds. As Rose Quartz, she might have changed her behavior, but unlearning these attitudes was a lifetime struggle (even with the love of her life Greg Universe, it took effort for her to see him as an equal). Actually facing the consequences of her past sins was something she avoided, which has caused constant trouble for her son Steven.
Steven Universe isn't a show that really does traditional villains. Everyone has been shown to be redeemable, even the Diamonds. Whether or not redemption is possible, however, there is still the question of whether forgiveness is always achievable or deserved. Even with Volleyball now dealing with her trauma, Pink Diamond's left scars that might not ever heal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crisis: Black Lightning Promo Includes Familiar Clues for CW Crossover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new promo for the next episode of Black Lightning features clues for the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover event.
The promo for "The Book Of Resistance: Chapter Four" focuses on China Anne McClain's Jennifer Pierce, who appears to be having issues with her growing powers. The first scene shows three different Jennifers: one in her Lightning costume, another in a Blackbird suit and the other in an all-white ensemble worn by prisoners of the ASA's Pit. As the skies above Freeland turn to red, Gambi tells Jefferson Pierce and Lynn Stewart that they're dealing with parallel universes.
More scenes feature Jennifer battling her doppelgangers, Jefferson and Lynn arguing, white-clothed Jennifer being taken out of the Pierce household by ASA agents, and finally, Jennifer and Jefferson fighting one-on-one with their lightning powers.
While "Crisis on Infinite Earths" will not have an episode dedicated to Black Lightning, this promo may reveal how the hero will be brought into the massive crossover. "Crisis on Infinite Earths" marks the first Arrowverse crossover to include Black Lightning, with Cress Williams reprising his role in hours three and five, according to the crossover event's showrunner and executive producer, Marc Guggenheim.
Guggenheim previously revealed that Black Lightning's inclusion was a late decision for "Crisis" due to the distance between the crossover's filming location in Vancouver and the Black Lightning series filming location in Atlanta. However, the writing team on Black Lightning was able to reduce Williams' role in several episodes to accommodate his appearance in "Crisis."
Airing Mondays at 9 pm ET on The CW, Black Lightning stars Cress Williams as Jefferson Pierce/Black Lightning, China Anne McClain as Jennifer Pierce, Nafessa Williams as Anissa Pierce/Thunder, Christine Adams as Lynn Stewart, Marvin "Krondon" Jones III as Tobias Whale, Damon Gupton as Billy Henderson and James Remar as Peter Gambi.
"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Supergirl, then continues in Batwoman on Monday, Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in The Flash on Tuesday, Dec. 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. After the winter hiatus, the crossover will conclude on Tuesday, Jan. 14 in Arrow at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in DC's Legends of Tomorrow at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE's Shawn Michaels Reacts to Joker/HBK Theme Mash-Up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following the release of Todd Phillips' Joker, the internet had some fun with the iconic scene in which Joaquin Phoenix's Clown Prince of Crime dances down a flight of stairs to "Rock and Roll Part 2" towards the end of the film -- recutting it with various different songs.
A recent instance of this meme saw Phoenix's Joker dancing to "Sexy Boy," the theme song used by WWE legend Shawn Michaels. After being posted online, this particular clip caught the eye of none other than Michaels himself, with WWE's first Grand Slam Champion giving it his seal of approval.
The video was shared to Twitter by WWE/NXT superstar Keith Lee. "The internet deserves this," Lee wrote. "This was shown to me by one of my favorite people. To whoever created this masterpiece... thank you. To the interwebs... you're welcome."
Before too long, the clip found its way to the Heartbreak Kid, who quote-tweeted Lee's post. "I give it 9 out of 10 on the HBK rating scale," Michaels wrote.
Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. It will be available on digital HD on Dec. 17 and Blu-ray and DVD on Jan. 7.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Marauders #3, by Gerry Duggan, Michele Bandini, Elisabetta D’Amico, Federico Blee, VC’s Cory Petit and Tom Muller, on sale now.
The Hellfire Club is one of the most exclusive, influential groups in the X-Men’s corner of the Marvel Universe, and it’s recruiting. While the Hellfire Club is usually a secret cabal of elite, influential mutants that tries to reshape the world from behind the scenes, the current iteration of the club, the Hellfire Trading Company, is a relatively more philanthropic operation.
Since the late Charles Xavier reorganized the X-Men and the rest of mutantkind on the living island Krakoa, the Hellfire Company has represented the economic interests of mutants to the rest of the world. Led by Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw and Kate -- not Kitty -- Pryde, the new Hellfire is concerned with the legal and black market global distribution of Krakoan medicine and bringing endangered mutants to Krakoa.
Click the button below to start this article in quick view.
Without a single leader over the entire operation, the Hellfire Company has a new hierarchy that theoretically gives Frost’s White Queen, Shaw’s Black King and Pryde’s Red Queen equal power and the right to name a Bishop and a Knight to serve under them. While Frost’s little-seen brother Christian will serve as her White Bishop, Marauders #3 sees Shinobi Shaw resurrected and join his father as the Black Bishop.
Although Shinobi was never a famous as his father, the younger Shaw was a semi-regular thorn in the X-Men’s sides for a few years following his 1991 debut in Jim Lee, Whilce Portacio and Chris Claremont’s X-Factor #67. With density-manipulating powers that alternatively made him intangible and unbreakable, Shinobi led a version of the Hellfire Club and was a member of the Upstarts, a murderous team of young mutant villains.
While Sebastian and Shinobi have both tried to kill each other in the past, the younger Shaw took his own life earlier this year in Uncanny X-Men.
However, Sebastian hides that fact from a newly-resurrected Shinobi and tells him that Frost and Pryde were behind his death. With his lie, Sebastian positions himself as his son’s only ally in the Hellfire Company, which seems to have as much infighting and backstabbing as any iteration of the Hellfire Club.
If the Black King had his way, Shinobi would’ve joined Hellfire as the Red King, but Frost gave that position to Pryde before that could happen. Even though Shinobi spends most of this issue in a Red King’s crimson wardrobe, he joins the Hellfire Company as the Black Bishop.
While both Shaws have been members of the Hellfire Club in the past, this marks the first time that both have been members of the same Hellfire organization at the same time. Since Frost and her brother currently make up another branch of the organization, Hellfire’s Inner Circle is more insular than its been in years.
Traditionally, membership in the Hellfire Club has been hereditary. X-Men like Archangel, Sunspot, Psylocke and Captain Britain have all been welcomed into the Club since their privileged, upper-class ancestors were members. In its current form, the Hellfire Company doubles down on that idea by concentrating mutant wealth and economic power in a few wealthy families.
However, Pryde’s presence in the Hellfire Company seems to counter this idea. As the sea-faring savior of lost mutants, she already embodies Hellfire’s most altruistic impulses, and she has a relatively normal middle-class background that makes her a solid ambassador for the rest of mutantkind’s interests.
Perhaps as a further counter to the other members’ entrenched sense of privilege, Pryde tries to recruit the X-Men’s Bishop as her Red Bishop. Despite the obvious pun, Bishop handily refuses Kitty’s offer. While his time growing up in a broken future world would’ve brought a fresh perspective to Hellfire, Bishop usually gravitates towards semi-independent missions or mysteries that require his full attention.
Even with the concentration of Shaws and Frosts in the Hellfire Company, both Pryde and Emma Frost still seem genuinely concerned about the plight of other mutants. As the newest pawn in Sebastian’s power struggle against those two X-Men, Shinobi may end up finding himself in the middle of Krakoa’s first civil war.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Persona 5 Royal Is Coming To ... The Chrono Trigger Writer's Mobile JRPG</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's still no Persona 5 on the Switch, and God only knows when Atlus are porting Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal to PC, but at least Joker and co are making an appearance in another Japanese RPG.
That game is Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space, the mobile RPG created by Masato Kato, the writer behind the majority of Chrono Trigger. We've checked out Another Edenwhen it launched at the beginning of the year. It's purely a solo RPG, so despite the small element of gacha that's inevitable in mobile JRPGs, Ethan found there wasn't a fight he couldn't beat for free and the game was genuinely story-driven.
Now, that mobile JRPG is getting its own piece of Persona 5. The Phantom Thieves and Joker will be added to the game as part of a simultaneous worldwide update for Another Eden. It's called Bound Wills and the Hollow Puppeteer, and players will be able to enjoy the chapter's prologue after finishing the second chapter of Another Eden's main story, with the rest of the story accessible after finishing Another Eden's 13th chapter.
There's a lot of similar beats between Another Eden and Chrono Trigger, with characters asking getting philosophical about shaping the future and travelling 800 years into the future after a boss fight. Each character has their own class and special abilities, with new fighters accessible through Chronos Stones, a currency you earn from in-game challenges or just straight out paying real-world money for. You'll get enough Stones in the first hour to buy your first character.
If you want to get a sense of what you're in for, here's a chunk of gameplay from the beginning on Android. Another Eden is available on Android, iOS and iPad now, with the free Personal 5: Royal crossover being patched into the game from December 11 for all users.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disney Unveils First Stills From 'Falcon and Winter Soldier' & 'WandaVision'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marvel and Disney has unveiled the first images of the upcoming Falcon and Winter Soldier and WandaVision at São Paulo’s 2019 Comic-Con Experience, which took place over the last weekend.
The first two stills depict Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, both reprising their roles as Falcon and Winter Soldier respectively. The duo are seen out of their combat uniforms and dressed instead in civilian clothing. While there’s not much more information about what the plot would entail, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige has confirmed that it will follow from Avengers: Endgame and see Falcon donning Captain America’s shield. We also know that Daniel Bruhl will be returning as Baron Zemo, the villain in Civil War, with Emily VanCamp also reprising her role as Sharon Carter. Wyatt Russell will be joining as the new character John Walker.
Second, comes a black and white still from the upcoming WandaVision series, which will see Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda transform into the formidable Scarlet Witch, with Paul Bettany starring alongside her as Vision. The image depicts the duo seemingly in a happy marriage, with the aesthetic of a sitcom from the ’50s. Feige has also confirmed that the series will have a significant impact on the “entire future Phase 4 of the MCU” and follows from Endgame, so it remains a mystery how Vision — who was killed in Infinity War — will play into the show. Joining Olsen and Bettany are Kat Dennings and Randall Park, reprising their roles as Darcy Louis (from Thor) and Jimmy Woo (from Ant-Man and the Wasp).
Take a closer look at the stills below, and for more entertainment news, Peter Sarsgaard is joining the cast of Matt Reeves’ The Batman.

The festive season is a busy time for Santa Claus. The whole world, one night, a f*ck-load of presents – how does he keep the energy up?
Well, if Walmart’s adult-themed yuletide jumpers are anything to go by, it isn’t thanks to milk and cookies. No no, Santa favours ‘quality, grade A, Colombian snow’.
Advertisements
Walmart Canada has now issued an apology after some controversial (and hilarious) sweaters were listed for sale on their website.
A Walmart spokesperson told Global News: 
Of all the jumpers, the highlight is one featuring a wide-eyed Father Christmas, sitting in front of three lines of a white substance – I’m guessing it’s not sugar.
Created by clothing company FUN Wear, and called the ‘Let It Snow Ugly Christmas Sweater’, it had Twitter users in stitches.

The product description, now taken down from the website, read: 
While some weren’t exactly pleased about this narcotics-loving Santa, others loved it. One Twitter user wrote: ‘This is the best ugly Christmas sweater copy ever written.’
There were other jumpers too: one featured St. Nick ‘roasting his chesnuts on an open fire’, another saw Santa lying on a table with his pants down as an alien prepares to probe him.

The product description for the latter read: 
We all love a bit of fun around Christmas, but you need to draw the line somewhere.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scarlet Witch Will Finally Get Her Big Title In WandaVision</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This weekend is CCXP, Comic Con Experience São Paulo, and during a recent panel there MCU head honcho Kevin Feige dropped some fascinating details about Marvel’s upcoming slate of programming and movies. Alongside some exclusive footage that hasn’t yet been released online, there was some interesting conversation about WandaVision, the Disney+ series that will star Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and the Vision (Paul Bettany) in some version of marital bliss.
Speaking to Collider, Feige explained how this show would be an opportunity to greatly expand and deepen the characterisation of Wanda, and offer a chance to turn her into the larger-than-life Marvel juggernaut that comic fans know and love.
“[We have] the opportunity to tell their story, and show more of what Wanda can do, more of what makes Vision, Vision, and most importantly, reveal a name that I’m not even sure we’ve said in the MCU yet, but we make a big deal of in the show, is the fact that Wanda is the Scarlet Witch,” Feige said. “And what does that mean, that she is the Scarlet Witch? That’s what we play into with this show in ways that are entirely fun, entirely funny, somewhat scary, and will have repercussions for the entire future of Phase 4 of the MCU.”
Wanda’s always been an important character, but this is something new. It suggests Wanda’s power, and her importance to the universe, being taken to a whole new level. And it’s satisfying, too; “Scarlet Witch” is just such a good name for a character. It rolls off the tongue, and has a strong set of associations.
Feige also commented that the introduction of the multiverse would continue to shape the storytelling of the Disney+ shows and the MCU at large, saying, “The multiverse is the next step in the evolution of the MCU, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is gonna crack it wide open in ways that will have repercussions for a Disney+ series just before it, that’s not WandaVision, and for movies just after it in a big, fun way.”
While this doesn’t make it clear that Wanda will be mucking around with the multiverse herself, it certainly leaves the door open for the idea.
WandaVision is set for Disney+ in 2021.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It has been the highlight of Derby’s Christmas celebrations for many years - the annual lights switch-on in the Market Place.
A colourful parade headed by no other than Father Christmas winding its way through the city centre and the fun-filled musical extravaganza which culminated in the big moment when the Market Place and surrounding streets were flooded with a sparkling lights display.
There have been many different versions of the event over the years but one thing has never changed, the excitement of the crowds who have packed into the square to witness the spectacle.
These fabulous photos from our archive show some of the switch-on events in the Noughties and the celebrities who have done the honours, including everyone from entertainer Lionel Blair and Coronation Street and Benidorm actress Sherrie Hewson to X-Factor finalists and Britain’s Got Talent winner George Sampson.
Were you in the crowds?

“I am totally obsessed,” Waller Bridge said. “I have never been so excited about writing anything.”
Her comments came at an event at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night to discuss her new book based on the hit TV show – Fleabag: The Scriptures.
It would not be Waller-Bridge’s first film credit. She was brought in to help polish off the script for the forthcoming Bond movie.
She also revealed a desire to write another play.
Fleabag was originally staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013 before being adapted for a BBC series three years later.
The second series introduced a character widely referred to as the “hot priest” by fans, who becomes a love interest for Fleabag – the show’s unnamed protagonist.
But Ms Waller-Bridge said she did not invent the term to refer to the character played by Andrew Scott.
“He is very much just ‘priest’ in the script – Twitter created ‘hot priest’, I believe,” she said.
But Waller-Bridge, who also stars as Fleabag, said she was nervous about writing the character.
“I was worried about writing a priest, especially a comedy priest,” she said, revealing that she was afraid of falling into some traps.
Published last month, Fleabag: The Scriptures contains the show’s script and new writing from Waller-Bridge.
The show started life as a 10-minute monologue at the Leicester Square Theatre in London, but was made into a full Edinburgh show after Waller-Bridge was accosted by a member of the audience afterwards.
The writer revealed that an “absolutely hammered” woman came up to her to demand she turn the short piece into a full-length play.
“That was so f****** good, you’ve got to take it to Edinburgh,” the woman said, according to Waller Bridge. “I was like ‘yeah, yeah’,” she said. “The next day Francesca (Moody, Fleabag’s producer) contacted the Underbelly.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juice WRLD: Rapper dies following medical emergency at Chicago airport</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rapper and singer Juice WRLD has died in Chicago, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said Sunday.
Juice, who was born Jarad Anthony Higgins, turned 21 on December 2.
The rapper suffered a medical emergency shortly after arriving at Chicago's Midway International Airport, according to people who were traveling with him, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email to CNN. The rapper died shortly after at a nearby hospital, according to police.
"There were no signs of foul play and all individuals aboard the aircraft are cooperating with CPD and have given all of their information," Guglielmi said.
Police are waiting for the medical examiner to determine cause and manner of death, he said.
An autopsy hasn't been performed and no cause of death has been determined, Cook County Medical Examiner's Office spokeswoman Natalia Derevyanny said.
"Juice made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time," the artist's label, Interscope Records, said in a statement . "He was a gentle soul, whose creativity knew no bounds, an exceptional human being and artist who loved and cared for his fans above everything else."
Juice was signed to Interscope Records in March 2018 after scoring hits on SoundCloud with "Lucid Dreams" and "All Girls Are the Same," according to Billboard magazine , which profiled the artist in March.
SoundCloud says Juice was the most streamed, liked, and reposted artist on its platform in 2018 and "Lucid Dreams" notched the most plays of any song last year.
Juice WRLD was named Top New Artist at the Billboard Music Awards in May.
Billboard said his songs reached its Hot 100 chart 25 times in less than two years. Juice was included on three songs on the Hot 100 ranking as of Saturday, Billboard said, including two as lead artist.
Music world stunned by the sudden death
Several of Juice's fellow artists reacted to the news of his death on social media, including Drake.
"I would like to see all the younger talent live longer," he wrote on Instagram, "and I hate waking up hearing another story filled with blessings was cut short."
Fellow artist Lil Yachty, who featured Juice on his song "Yacht Club," expressed his shock on Twitter. "Wow, I can not believe this. Rip my brother juice world," he wrote.
Singer Ellie Goulding collaborated with Juice on the song "Hate Me" earlier this year. She shared photos of them together and said he was a "sweet soul."
"You had so much further to go, you were just getting started. You'll be missed Juice," she wrote.
Chart topper Lil Nas X paid tribute on Twitter, saying it's "so sad how often this is happening" to up-and-coming artists.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Top Irish Christmas traditions that make the season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here are just a few of Ireland’s favorite things at Christmas – some old, some new, but all activities and aspects that make Christmas in Ireland particularly special.  
In Ireland, Christmas lasts for about two weeks and is joyfully celebrated as a respite from the winter. Christmas really brings out the best in Ireland and the Irish, from cheerful festivities to wild acts of machismo, happy reunions, musical celebrations in church, and partying for weeks. These are the top Irish Christmas traditions. 
If you’re looking for a Church packed to the rafters, look no further than any church in Ireland at midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. This is a huge social gathering where family, friends, and neighbors who you may not have seen all year come together and celebrate Christmas.
With Christmas carols being sung and, often, live music being played, midnight Mass in Ireland is a great place to catch up with old friends and get in touch with the local community at Christmas.
St. Stephen is the patron saint of horses, but I am almost positive that this is not the reason that horse races on St. Stephen’s Day have become a tradition in Ireland. The races in Leopardstown in south Dublin, attract almost 20,000 people every year, but I think this has little to do with the old Germanic tradition of racing horses on St. Stephen’s Day to honor the saint.
In Ireland, heading off to the races is a chance to get out of the house, stretch your legs, perhaps have a flutter on the horses and have a drink with friends.
Christmas day swims take place all over Ireland on Christmas morning, but probably most famously at the Forty Foot Rock, just south of Dublin. On Christmas Day, hundreds of people can be seen jumping off the rock into the Irish Sea wearing only their bathing suits.
The water in the Irish Sea on Christmas Day is usually around 50F / 10C. Unfortunately, the temperature outside the water is usually far below that, making the experience bracing, to say the least. This is certainly not for the faint of heart but is a proven hangover cure, and participants often receive sponsorship for charities.
"The Dead" is a short story from James Joyce’s collection "Dubliners." A group of Dubliners gathers together for a post-Christmas celebration in James Joyce's transcendent tale of the banality and magic in life and death.
This tale has rather become like an Irish version of "The Christmas Carol," a tale of reflection on our past, our present, and our future.
This started off with aunties, grandmothers and relatives handing over hideous sweaters as presents for Christmas, but somehow Christmas sweaters have turned into a competition on the streets of Ireland. The woolier, hairier, and more ridiculously decorated the better. In fact, this year I spotted a gentleman with fake robins, bells and fairy lights all on one sweater.
During penal times, a group of soldiers was about to be ambushed. They had been surrounded, but a group of wrens pecked on their drums and woke them. The wren became known as “The Devil’s Bird.” To remember this, on St. Stephen’s Day people have a procession and go door-to-door wearing old clothes, blackened faces, and carrying a dead (now more often fake) wren on top of the pole. Then, crowds of "strawboys" dressed in straw suits and masks march to celebrate the wren.
This later evolved into a caroling event. Although people no longer go door-to-door, or at least very rarely, carolers can be heard on many main streets over Christmas raising money for charity. It there’s one thing the Irish love doing is making music and Christmas is the perfect excuse to make some noise.
Recently, I saw an Irish comic speak about USA biscuits for five minutes straight. It was only then that I realized that everyone I knew had a tin of biscuits in the house over Christmas when I was growing up.
Although there were the traditional mince pieces, pudding, and chocolates too, the biscuits and the rules about the tin are something that everyone I’ve spoken to remember. There were about ten types of biscuits in each layer of the tin but you were not allowed to break through to the second layer without finishing the first layer. This would cause at least one fight a day among the family. The tins were also filled with old-fashioned biscuits like pink wafers and bourbon creams.
Christmas decorations in Ireland traditionally were just a wreath of holly on the front door of the house. However, National Lampoon’s “Christmas Vacation” seems to have been a blueprint for many Irish households as they are now lit up like Rockefeller Center.
Also traditionally, decorations would go up on December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and come down on Little Christmas, January 6. However, this year I spotted full Christmas decorations on some houses in the first week of November. What can we say? The Irish love Christmas.
Most stores are closed Christmas and Stephen’s Day, but a brand new tradition sees more and more stores now opening after Christmas Day for exchanges and tempting deals.
January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, is traditionally when the Irish finish celebrating Christmas. It is also known as Nollaig na mBan in Irish (Women’s Christmas).
Tradition has it that women get the day off and the men of the house get to do the housework, cooking and take down the Christmas decorations. Women meet up, have a day out and treat themselves.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Sarsgaard Has Been Cast in The Batman in an Unknown Role</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Though fans have a guess… or two.
Matt Reeves made Bat-waves yesterday when he posted a simple tweet. Only three words, and one gif. The words? “Oh… Hi, Peter…” Oh, and there was also a Bat emoji. That part is pretty important.
That’s right, it appears Sarsgaard is next in line to join the franklyincredible cast of The Batman, alongside Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, and Paul Dano. Only problem is, Reeves didn’t divulge what might be the most important detail: who he’s playing. Fans have a guess, though, based on rumours about the film and some hints posted online.
One such hint might come from the Instagram of Sarsgaard’s wife, former Bat-star herself Maggie Gyllenhaal, who, concurrent with the announcement, posted an image of Sarsgaard mid-shave. Which is to say, solidly halfway through it.

Yep, that, along with the weird second face in the Sarsgaard gif chosen by Reeves, and just general rumours that the film might be taking inspiration from The Long Halloween, a lot of fans are assuming that Sarsgaard is going to be playing Harvey Dent, Two-Face himself. Is this true? I have no idea. But I think it would be neat!
For more The Batman news, stay tuned to Gizmodo. The movie is scheduled to hit cinemas on 25th June 2021, with filming starting next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rapper Juice Wrld dies at 21 after seizure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juice Wrld, the fast-rising young American rapper best known for his 2018 hit Lucid Dreams, has died shortly after suffering a seizure at Chicago’s Midway Airport. He was 21 years old.
A statement from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said that Jarad A. Higgins had died on Sunday, according to The New York Times. The statement did not give a cause of death.
The news was first reported by TMZ, which cited law enforcement sources saying that the rapper experienced a seizure while walking through the airport, and was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after.
Born and raised in Chicago, Juice had enjoyed a rapid ascension since he first began posting his songs to SoundCloud as a teenager in 2015, working in a style that blended elements of emo and rock with hip-hop.
His independently-released 2017 track Lucid Dreams proved to be a career-maker, rising steadily until an official single release in 2018 broke him on to the pop charts, where the song would peak at No. 2.
Signing to Interscope Records in early 2018, Juice released his debut album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, almost immediately after, which was certified platinum before the end of the year, and contained yet another No. 2 single in All Girls Are the Same.
His busy year continued with a summer in memoriam EP dedicated to late fellow SoundCloud rappers XXXTentacion and Lil Peep; a collaborative album with Future, Wrld on Drugs, which reached No. 2 on the album chart in October; and an original song on the soundtrack for the film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
Juice released his second album, Death Race for Love, earlier this year. It was his first effort to reach No. 1 on the album chart. Also this year, he toured Europe with Nicki Minaj on a co-headlining bill.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Korean actress Jeon Hye-bin holds private wedding ceremony in Bali</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Put your thumb and index finger together and make the “finger heart” gesture, for South Korean actress/singer Jeon Hye-bin has tied the knot and held a private wedding ceremony right here in Bali. 
After having announced earlier this month that she would marry her boyfriend, who remains unnamed, the 36-year-old shared on Instagram that she they finally married at a private ceremony in Bali on Saturday in front of their family members and close friends. 
Jeon Hye-bin kept details about the event closely guarded, so it’s unclear exactly where in Bali the ceremony took place.
The caption of her post reads as follows, as translated by K-pop news outlet Soompi: 
Hello, this is Jeon Hye Bin.
This year has been so special for me. With many things going on, I met a person I love and am now making an eternal promise with him, he has a great character and personality, and he is able to connect with me deeply. We are much happier and more stable when we are together, so we decided to get married and live for each other.
With the sudden wedding announcement, I was not able to even tell those around me. I was worried that it would interfere with my drama, and I was worried that it would cause a disturbance to the family who will be welcoming me. Please understand and I hope you will still be willing to give your congratulations.
I will become a bride who can take care of him, always make him happy and lucky. We will be a couple who can share with each other and experience good things.
Please watch over us with love.
Jeon Hye-bin began her career in showbiz as a singer in 2002, becoming a member of the short-lived three-member girl group called LUV, which was disbanded after just six months due to their lack of popularity. After that, she released her first solo album titled Love Somebody and then ventured into acting through popular K-drama Sang Doo! Let’s Go to School in 2003 — starring K-pop superstar Rain — and a horror film titled Dead Friend in 2004. 
Jeon Hye-bin found mainstream success in 2005 thanks to her second album, In My Fantasy, after the release of which she decided to focus on her acting career instead. She has starred in various K-dramas such as Insu, The Queen Mother (2011), Gunman in Joseon (2014), Another Oh Hae-young (2016), Life on Mars (2018), Liver or Die (2019), with the most recent one being Leverage, the remake of an American TV series of the same title.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David Bermantook his own life in August just days before his new project Purple Mountains were to have started their first-ever tour. There has been an outpouring of love since, with tributes and benefit shows, most recently William Tyler’s in Nashville that featured a number of other former Silver Jews live members (including Berman’s widow, Cassie).
For those in NYC, there will be a Berman tribute/benefit happening at Union Pool on January 4, which would’ve been his 53rd birthday. Dubbed “DCBday,” the night will feature members of Silver Jews and Purple Mountains and proceeds go to Musicares and the NYC chapter of The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Tickets are on sale now.
The full lineup hasn’t been announced yet, but the bands for the night — The Blue Arrangements, The Wild Kindness, Peers in the Punklight and Birds of Virginia — will include Silver Jews players Steve West (who is also in Pavement) and Matt Hunter (also of New Radiant Storm King), and Purple Mountains player Kyle Forester (also of Woods). Singers include Patrick Stickles (Titus Andronicus) with lots more to be announced. Boston’s Hallelujah the Hills will also be on the bill, comedian/musician Chris Crofton will MC the night, and Union Pool will be decorated by artist and album cover designer Steve Keene.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Column: From ‘Sabre Dance’ to ‘We're Gonna Win That Cup’, music elevates Sabres fans' experience</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the Buffalo Sabres celebrate their 50th year as an NHL franchise in a city and surrounding environs rightly revered collectively as a serious “hockey town,” let's ruminate on the marriage of music and sport.
This phenomenon might not be unique to Buffalo, but as Sabres in-game organist Curtis Cook points out, there are clear inherent connections between sports and the arts in our local culture.
“Buffalonians certainly love their sports and the arts,” Cook said. “I'm lucky enough to be one of the people that help blend those two things together.”
Music has been used to dramatic effect from our team’s beginnings, when an excerpt from composer Aram Khachaturian’s 1942 ballet “Gayane” became the Sabres’ clarion call as they took the ice. That excerpt, known as “Sabre Dance,” has been pumping up the heart rates of players and fans alike virtually without pause since 1970. That tradition will continue Tuesday night in KeyBank Center, as the Sabres return from a Western road trip to host the St. Louis Blues.
(The piece was placed on hiatus briefly in the early 2000s, and the Scorpions’ “Rock You Like A Hurricane” filled the gap, but “Sabre Dance” returned in 2011, and has stayed since.)
“There has been so much influential music throughout the 50 years of this franchise's history,” Cook said. “Everyone knows about ‘Sabre Dance,’ which I still play on the organ at least once a game, at the beginning of a period. I think it's a unique and diverse piece of music and it's been associated with the team for so long that fans of every age can identify it immediately.”
Khachaturian’s piece, which was a huge radio hit in 1948, has gone on to be covered, interpreted, reinterpreted, and reassembled myriad times over the years, in virtually any genre imaginable. Everyone from Woody Herman and Liberace to composer Danny Elfman, vocalist Nina Hagen, violinist Vanessa Maye, and the Brian Setzer Orchestra has taken a swing at the high-energy piece.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg, according to Cook.
“The original ‘Sabre Dance’ with full orchestration is the version that everyone knows, but a lot of people don't realize that it has been covered by more contemporary groups over the years.
"For example, a Belgian group named the Jokers covered it, as did a group called Love Sculpture, featuring Welsh singer/songwriter/guitarist Dave Edmunds in it. Both of those groups covered the song without an orchestra and with more modern instrumentation – electric guitars, electric bass, drums – and I think those versions sound awesome, too.”
Sabres announcer Dan Dunleavy, a self-taught guitarist with a deep and abiding love for music, recently had a dream about "Sabre Dance."
"I quite literally had a dream where I was playing a heavy, riff-y version of 'Sabre Dance' on guitar from the booth as the team takes the ice," he laughed. "I mean, how cool would that be? Maybe someday."
Of course, "Sabre Dance," as invigorating as it remains, doesn’t tell the whole story. Over the years, tunes by artists as diverse as Led Zeppelin (“The Immigrant Song”), DJ Kool (goal song “Let Me Clear My Throat”), Metallica (“Fuel”), Flo Rida (“Low (featuring T-Pain”) and the Who (“Baba O’Riley”) have blasted from the rafters of the old Aud and KeyBank Center between play.
The hometown Goo Goo Dolls' "Better Days" became an anthem for the Sabres' 2007 playoff run.
There have also been locally produced novelty theme songs, many of which have jumped several generation gaps by this point.
“Through the decades, there's been such a connection between fans and songs like 'We're Gonna Win That Cup' (written by Tommy Calandra and performed by Donna McDaniel) from the Sabres’ Stanley Cup run in '75, the radio jingle 'Rock 'em Sabres,' and the (Buffalo Chamber of Commerce-commissioned) 'Buffalo Talkin' Proud' jingle of the '80s,” Cook said.
Maria Sebastian's remake of "We're Gonna Win That Cup" was played frequently during the Sabres' run to the Stanley Cup final in 1999.
“I still play a lot of these songs on the organ," Cook said. "Every time I do, I always have people tweeting me or coming up to me at the game saying that hearing any of those songs I mentioned brought back a certain memory. I love hearing people's stories on how they connect a memory with a certain piece of music.”
“I love ‘Sabre Dance’ and hope it always has some place within their presentation, even if it's just accompanying old highlights or something like that,” WGR 550 AM’s Chris “Bulldog” Parker said. “But I think the team ought to let a different player pick the entrance song each night. Make it a part of the intro, maybe even have the player on the Jumbotron introducing the song and, if they're comfortable enough, saying something about why they chose the song.”
Dunleavy went whole-hog on anthemic arena-rock when asked what song he’d be thrilled to hear as the team takes the ice.
“Queen’s ‘One Vision,’” Dunleavy said, citing the lyrics’ encapsulation of the Sabres fan experience. “'One goal, one fight, one true religion’ – that, for Buffalo, being their Sabres and hockey in general.
"That song represents the Sabres, for sure, but it also represents something that I truly feel is unique about Buffalo. Here, everyone is all-in on everything relating to Buffalo – whether that's the Bills, the Sabres, the development of Main Street, what might happen as Canalside grows, what's gonna become of the Skyway – it doesn't matter the topic, and it doesn't matter if we disagree.
"Having lived in Toronto and traveled to so many different cities, I can say for sure that it's not like that everywhere. From music culture to politics to sports, even if we disagree around here, we all care."
In the end, a winning season comes down to much more than the right song, the right sound, the right lyric and the right fan attitude. The team, of course, needs to do the work. The right music can, at the least, help set the mood and frame the experience for the fans.
“I'm certainly still a fan when I’m working,” Cook said. “I think to be a successful sports organist, you really need to be a fan yourself. You're essentially a cheerleader for 19,000 people, so as a live musician, I can change the mood of the music instantly and in turn, help get the crowd going.
“For example, if play stops and I begin to play a song in a major key that's upbeat and then players start pushing and shoving, I can instantly modulate into a minor key and make the organ music sound like villainous chase music from an old silent film to fit the mood of what is going on down on the ice.”
How is Cook feeling about the Sabres' chances this year?
“I am the eternal optimist,” he said. “No matter what happens, I am always all-in on the Sabres. They were my team even before I started working for them and they always will be my team, no matter what. I always hope we can get to the playoffs, year after year. I always look forward to hockey season starting and getting back to the arena to work and cheer for the guys on the ice.
“I’ve lived here all my life, and I can say for certain that Buffalo has an incredibly, and unusually, loyal fan base.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">South African Zozibini Tunzi crowned Miss Universe 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An African was crowned Miss Universe 2019 over the weekend and she was in the person of South African Zozibini Tunzi. She emerged top of the pack after a night of colourful displays and gruelling aptitude events.
She incorporated colours of the South African flag in her costumes scaling through the different rounds till she was eventually crowned. She was handed the crown by out gone queen Catriona Gray.
Gray, 2018 winner, sandwiches Zozibini and another South African former winner Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters who won the crown in 2017.
The final took place at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, GA USA. Runners-up were Miss Puerto Rico, Madison Anderson and Miss Mexico, Sofía Aragón.
The brief biography of the 26-year-old winner who is from Tsolo read: “Zozibini Tunzi is a passionate activist and engaged in the fight against gender based violence.
“She has devoted her social media campaign to changing the narrative around gender stereotypes. She is a proud advocate for natural beauty and encourages women to love themselves the way they are.”
Ms Tunzi had been a strong voice in campaigning against gender-based violence, GBV, in South Africa. She had at a point urged South African men to write what she described as love letters to the country’s women.
The country has some of the highest rates of GBV figures across Africa. In her response to what young girls needed most in growing up, she cited leadership.
“It’s something that has been lacking in young girls and women for a very long time not because we don’t want to but because of what society has labelled women to be. I think we are the most powerful beings in the world,” she said.
The Miss Universe Organization (MUO) is a global, inclusive organization that celebrates women of all cultures and backgrounds and empowers them to realize their goals through experiences that build self- confidence and create opportunities for success.
They are the organizers of three main pageants: MISS UNIVERSE, MISS USA and MISS TEEN USA which according to their website provides the approximately 10,000 women who participate annually an international platform to effect positive change personally, professionally and philanthropically as inspirational leaders and role models.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tap to listen to this article instead: 🔊 Listen to Post
There are many ethnicities of Asian people across the world including Malays, Chinese, Indians, Thais, Vietnamese, Japanese and so forth. With these variations also come different practices but one culture stands strong as the one thing all Asians do. They don’t wear shoes in their homes.
Hence, it’s only normal for guests who visit Asian households to remove their shoes along with their hosts as a sign of understanding and respect for their culture, right?
Right.
But one woman named Margaret has decided that it’s rude for those who have implemented this culture into their households to have their guests adhere to the same rules. She even went so far as to write an article titled ‘I Think It’s Rude To Ask Guests To Take Off Their Shoes – Here’s Why‘, about a year ago. And get this. Her reason as to why it’s rude?
Because her outfit would not look complete without her shoes.
Now, the article has resurfaced and is making its rounds online – and Asians are not having it. Here are just some of their responses.
And the best part, not only is removing your shoes before entering a home an Asian thing, but other cultures from around the globe have adopted the practice and are also giving Margaret a piece of their mind.
Hence, Margaret; if you’re reading this, many around the world are now practising the no-shoe policy in their households and it’s only normal for guests to understand and follow along. In fact, it’s rude if you don’t.
And if you can’t accept that, then be prepared for your own guests to track in mud, dirt, dog poop and whatever else they probably stepped on, on their way to your home.
You’ll understand when it happens to you and you’re left to sweep, mop and clean up the filth that’s left behind once everyone leaves.
Rude.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I promise this isn’t supposed to be an insult: The members of NYC quartet Loose Buttons were toddlers when Is This It came out, but they remind me of one of those post-Strokes bubblegum rock bands that would jockey for placement in O.C. episodes and iPod commercials. They are kids playing a cleaned-up and ultra-catchy version of hip downtown rock ‘n’ roll, like Phantom Planet fronted by a young, winsomely sneering Alex Turner. I like it!
Not long ago Loose Buttons shared the title track from their debut album Something Better. Today they’ve got another single out. The new one, “Fell Into A Hole,” is a bit like Tokyo Police Club doing their best to evoke “Left Of The Dial.” It features guest vocals from Ava Trilling of Forth Wanderers fame. The bridge has big Julian Casablancas energy, and the ending even kind of disappears into a void.
Singer Eric Nizgretsky has this to say:

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 10 Best Country Albums Of 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you ask Twitter — or your teenage nephew in Los Angeles — the story of country music in 2019 was Lil Nas X and “Old Town Road,” the song that became infamous both for breaking chart records and being booted off one, too. For those outside of the sphere of Nashville, the trajectory of the TikTok star embodied everything they needed to know about the genre’s seemingly exclusionary, insular world, where Lil Nas X couldn’t be accepted as “country” even with Billy Ray Cyrus in tow. It was a good scapegoat for the outside world to once again hone in on Nashville’s myopia, warranted or not.
But as fun a story (and a bop) as “Old Town Road” is, it’s not truly the picture of country music in 2019, a year rich with developments both bold and subtle, and with so many great albums that collecting only 10 is a near impossible feat. “Old Town Road” wasn’t the most captivating country moment, and it wasn’t even it’s most interesting cross collaboration: Maren Morris’ year, for one, saw her funneling the steam of a massive pop hit, “The Middle,” into her sophomore album GIRL and then taking a hard left turn into the Highwomen, where she harmonized on pure country songs alongside Amanda Shires, a brilliant artist much more known to the Americana and indie rock worlds. This, truly, is where things really got interesting and fruitful, breaking down lines not just between genres but also within them, and the boundaries we’re supposed to accept.
Country music — always in that battle between mainstream (radio-friendly) output and the independent world — took many steps like this towards a new era where collaboration, and cross-pollination, meant something different. Luke Combs, arguably the biggest mainstream breakout in country in the past two years, played at Willie Nelson’s ranch (and made a good album too). Tyler Childers signed a major record deal and snagged a Grammy. Artists like Midland and Jon Pardi embraced country so twangy and traditional it’s almost more Americana than country radio.
Brandi Carlile became an omnipresent force: as a part of the Highwomen, on Maren Morris and Zac Brown’s albums, and co-producing Tanya Tucker’s triumphant return, While I’m Livin’. So universally beloved and so genuinely good — both in heart and in talent — Carlile’s almost becoming the Dolly Parton heir apparent. (Just look at Newport Folk Festival this past summer, where they sang together.) A leader for the genre who is openly lesbian, dedicated to charity work, speaks her mind freely, and still snags an invite to the CMAs? Yeah, sign us up for that future.
Country radio aside, the genre’s as rich and interesting as it’s ever been, particularly from its independent voices: That scene birthed excellent records from Kelsey Waldon, Michaela Anne, Caroline Spence, Erin Enderlin, Emily Scott Robinson, Dori Freeman, Ian Noe, Kelleigh Bannen, Kalie Shorr, Gabe Lee, Charles Wesley Godwin and many more from Texas to Canada to New York and back. It bred fantastic EPs, too, from Hailey Whitters, Charlie Marie, and Ruston Kelly. Some blended in singer-songwriter approaches, some were deeply traditional, some conjured up emo influences that worked shockingly well with the direct nature of country lyricism. (Kelly’s cover of Dashboard Confessional’s “Screaming Infidelities” is a gift).
The best albums this year, though, proved just how diverse the palate of country music can be, even when it exists well within genre walls. They toyed with expectations and rules: with how country is supposed to sound, how teams are supposed to only play amongst themselves, of the narratives that the genre is supposed to tell. They elevated women’s stories, stories of Appalachia and rural America, of love from all angles and the boundaries of who gets to participate in the genre to begin with. But, most of all, they told the truth.
Kalie Shorr could easily become a pop sensation if she wanted to. She understands the dynamics of hooks, how to connect with a fanbase, and pure saccharine fun just as good as the best. But she’s too damn honest, too damn country for that game. “I’ve never been worse, thanks for asking,” she sings on the first track of Open Book, “Too Much To Say,” which is the answer song to any “how are you” question that never really expected an answer, or wanted to hear it if it came. But you want to listen to Shorr — singing about pain and drug addiction and loss and sex in such a no-bullshit way that it never feels like you’re being asked to carry her emotional baggage — you’re just invited to drop yours along too. Country music needs this kind of fire.

It’s so hard to pigeonhole Michaela Anne — there’s a strong singer-songwriter thread, a well-versed instrumentalist, an Americana faithful, and a true lover ’90s greats (Shania Twain, for one). It gives her a perspective so uniquely her own on Desert Dove, an album that paints a story of a life lived on her own terms (“By Our Design,” a song sure to spark your own longing for a personal rulebook), of a woman who won’t take any of your shit (“If I Wanted Your Opinion”), and of the importance of being kind to those that are suffering (“Be Easy”). Anne’s vocals make the lessons go down easily, and her writing makes them impossible to forget.

“There’s nothing that I cannot do with a double latte and dry shampoo,” sings Emily Scott Robinson on one of Traveling Mercies’ lighter moments, “White Hot Country Mess.” It’s a universal truth, though, that feeling of making it through anything with a little push of caffeine and some no-shower cover. That’s what Robinson continually captures perfectly: monogamy that gets better over time (“The way we fight a little less now,” she sings on “Better With Time,” “make love a little more”), the toil of going town to town, just trying to make a living on “Borrowed Rooms And Old Wood Floors,” the hopelessness of working to win back someone who will never return the feeling (“Pie Song”). The album’s centerpiece is “The Dress,” a song that encompasses the impossibly complex mix of emotions that linger in the mind of a rape survivor in one brilliantly haunting line: “Was it the dress I wore?” she asks. No sexual assault is ever the fault of the victim, but that carried guilt, that shame, that self-blame is as heavy a weight on the shoulders as anything.

It’s the anthem we knew we needed but had not yet been delivered: “GIRL,” the title track from Maren Morris’ second LP, became a rallying cry for every woman in 2019 who felt under-appreciated, over-compared, run down, and discouraged. That’s the kind of inertia that starts GIRL, with a whole load of permission for both the audience and Morris herself to take a ride free of judgment.
That’s how Morris operates, too, when she’s making music. She has a rich ear for a country lyric (“We took a hard left, but we’re all right”), a huge grasp of a hopelessly fun melodies, and a fearlessness when it comes to never landing her songs in one box or another. Co-produced with the late Busbee, GIRL bucks any and all conventions, with Morris singing about bridging political divides and recruiting Carlile for a duet on “Common,” getting sultry as hell on “RSVP,” and writing a classic ode to keeping a relationship strong on “The Bones.” Coupled with her work with the Highwomen, she’s one of the most versatile artists in any genre, let alone country.

Tyler Childers’ follow-up to his breakthrough debut, Purgatory, came with little surprises for his devoted fans. That’s because every single song of Country Squire was worked out and played on the road, tested and developed in front of real, live humans. For that reason, it’s almost easy to take its greatness for granted — but that would be a damn shame. In nine tight country-ass tracks, written to precision, Childers sings of passion and small town life and remaining devoted on the road — sure, “Ever Lovin’ Hand” is about masturbation, but it’s really about the struggle to stay true to the ones we love — in his high-lonesome howl, so young and so aged all at once. And it’s wonderful to hear Childers, who is so strongly connected with that classic country, mountain sound, show that there’s not much of a line between Motown ballads of adoration and his own point of view on “All Your’n.”

John Prine’s label, Oh Boy, hadn’t signed anyone in 15 years when it announced it would be adding Kelsey Waldon to its roster. Those who had never heard of the Nashville-based, Kentucky-born Waldon figured this had to be something good: You don’t wait a decade and a half for mediocre. And those who had been listening to Waldon for years knew something even more certain: That it was about damn time someone snagged her. Waldon writes with detail and humanity, thoroughly connected to the roots of the genre, and her own roots, but always moving forward. Songs like “Kentucky, 1988″ tell her story so vibrantly you can see the knotty pines, the aging trailer and the plains, and feel the struggle of trying to love a father for all his imperfections. White Noise/White Lines is a fully realized album, flowing like one long journey into what keeps Waldon up at night, and what made her who she is.

Addiction, checkered pasts, personal struggle — for the men of country music, specifically the “outlaws,” those are the things that build “character,” a story of redemption or edginess or authenticity or however you want to fold it. For women, particularly older women, though, those things are often career-ending. It’s the same formula that had many dismissing Tanya Tucker for good, a singer so influential that she’s shaped everyone from Miranda Lambert to Margo Price to Brandi Carlile — the latter of whom teamed up with Shooter Jennings to producer Tucker’s new album, While I’m Livin’. There’s no album from a “veteran” of the genre that sounds so fresh this year, maybe even this decade. From the mischievous boogie of “Hard Luck” to the priceless lessons of “Bring My Flowers Now,” it feels like Tucker’s just getting started — again.

Many artists before have tried their hands at country-soul, but no one’s done it quite like Yola, who hails from Bristol, England and not the American south. It takes approximately one minute into her debut LP, the Dan Auerbach-produced Walk Through Fire, to know that this is no usual songwriter, and no usual voice. That song is “Faraway Look,” which has now been nominated for a Grammy and bursts with longing, passion, and a goose bump-inducing wall of sound. Only Yola can pack all of this superhuman stuff into a track that also reminds you she’s very human — lyrics like “Nobody moves the way you do, walking ’round the grocery store” shoot you so directly back into everyday life, it’s nearly unsettling — or take a retro spin through heartbreak on “Ride Out In The Country.” There’s no more exciting new Americana artist out there, full stop.

“Is happiness on the highway,” sings Miranda Lambert on “Settling Down,” “Or is it parked in the driveway?” No one can pack as much into a simple phrase as Lambert, nor sing so personally about things so universal. On Wildcard, her first album produced by Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Brothers Osborne), Lambert’s digging deep into her own very human conflicts. How do you choose love, when you love the road? How do you change when everyone knows your history? (Answer: You wash that shit out with a Tide Stick.) How do you honor the roots of country music while continually expanding your worldview, the way an artist should?
Lambert works through all of these on Wildcard, ending up with some of the most potent country songs of the year (“Bluebird,” “How Dare You Love”) while also having plenty of fun, too. And just when you think you know Lambert, she throws a curveball: There’s nothing as thirst-quenching as hearing her take those world-class vocals all gritty on the country gospel “Holy Water.” It makes you want to sin just so you can take a sip.

When news broke that Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris, Natalie Hemby, and Amanda Shires would be forming a project together, the internet dissolved into a near panic. When? Where? How? There have been country supergroups before — the Highwaymen, of course, and on to Pistol Annies and beyond — but this was something different. A movement meant to directly confront country radio with women’s stories, stories rarely heard on the airwaves in a sea of beer songs.
Part of the joy of the Highwomen is how selfless it felt in nature: Morris, one of the few female country artists who actually gets spins, taking attention and time away from her solo career to make an album that includes a lesbian love long? Shires, who released such an excellent, very non-country album To The Sunset last year, pivoting back to her roots for the sake of equality? Word-class writer Hemby, who could probably cook up 10 number-one hits in a day if she wanted, digging so deep and personal it’s hard to listen to her words without crying? And Carlile, on the crest of a career tidal wave, making her next move out of Grammy glory a battle for the unheard? Even Jason Isbell happily agreed to noodle away in the background, and out of the limelight. The Highwomen didn’t just feel like a group gathering. It felt like a calling.
All that powerful stuff aside, it’s the music that matters most. A key element here is empathy. Right out of the gate, their stunning rewrite of the classic Highwaymen anthem isn’t just Johnny Cash riding around inexplicably on a spaceship, it’s stories of the forgotten women who died in sacrifice for others, for her children, for human rights, for her neighbor. There’s empathy in songs like “My Name Can’t Be Mama Today,” a raucous slice of truth in a world of mombloggers painting parenting as constant perfection — this one gives permission to say it’s OK to, just for a minute, dream of not having that extra mouth to feed or bed to make. There’s empathy in “My Only Child,” Hemby’s gut-wrenchingly honest tribute to both great disappointment and great, great love, where Shires’ fiddle cries gorgeously on her shoulder. There’s empathy for the aging, in Shires’ exquisite “Cocktail And A Song,” and for those who live on after loss.
But there’s deep, deep power too. Power in “Redesigning Women,” the band’s radio single that hits on every corner of the modern woman (is there a better feminist rallying cry than “Some of us are saints and some of us are surgeons?”), power in the unity of “Crowded Table,” in Morris’ kiss-off “Loose Change,” in “Wheels Of Laredo,” a classic being made in real time. And there’s power in these voices: Morris’ unparalleled and raw riffing at the end of “Old Soul,” Shires’ Parton-like warble intimate and warm, Hemby’s mournful howl for the child she never had on “My Only Child,” and Carlile, who can sing literally anything better than, well, anyone, using her spotlight moments to transmit twangy country passion on “If She Ever Leaves Me.”
Some critics took issue with the group’s unison singing, but, in truth, it actually works perfectly. Democracy’s the point, and anyone can chant along here. Sure, this foursome could tackle the most complex of harmonies, but then these couldn’t be sung around campfires, couldn’t rotate different ranges and tones with ease. It makes the “sound” of the Highwomen more important, and more accessible, than any of the individual parts. (It sure helps, though, when the individual parts are extraordinary.) And it makes it able to live forever, in the voices of anyone who joins along. These songs will.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vicki Cornell, the widow of the late Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, is suing the surviving members of Soundgarden. TMZ reports that Vicky Cornell has filed legal documents claiming that her husband’s bandmates are withholding thousands of dollars in owed royalties and disputing the rights to seven unreleased songs.
In the legal documents, Vicky claims that these seven songs were “solely authored by Chris; contain Chris’ own vocal tracks; and were bequeathed to Chris’ Estate.” She wants to release the songs, and she says that she’s offered to share the recordings with Soundgarden. She would like to finish the releases in a way that Chris would have wanted, and she claims that the band has refused. The documents call Soundgarden’s refusal an “unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris’ Estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away.”
Vicky also claims that Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil has falsely claimed that she, Vicky, is the main obstacle to the release of a final Soundgarden album, which misleads Soundgarden’s “loyal, rabid fan base.” According to TMZ, the band disputes the claim that Chris Cornell worked on all seven songs solo. They say that they were working on the song files collaboratively and that Soundgarden members are attempting to claim co-writing credits on five of the seven songs.
Chris Cornell died by suicide in 2017 in a Detroit hotel room; he’d performed with Soundgarden in the city earlier that night. Cornell’s family has already sued Cornell’s doctor, claiming that the doctor overprescribed drugs to Cornell.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lizzo – “Good As Hell” Video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Right now, Lizzo is enjoying one of the weirdest pop-star breakout years I have ever witnessed. Months ago, Lizzo released her much-hyped major-label album Cuz I Love You, which was specifically engineered to turn her into a major figure. It didn’t happen. Instead, the two-year-old song “Truth Hurts” caught fire after showing up in a Netflix romantic comedy, finally ascending to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 later in the year. And now something similar seems likely to happen with an even older Lizzo song.
Lizzo first recorded the breezy empowerment jam “Good As Hell” for the soundtrack of the 2016 movie Barbershop: The Next Cut. Since then, it’s been in a whole lot of soundtracks: A Bad Moms Christmas, Blockers, I Feel Pretty, Brittany Runs A Marathon. In the wake of “Truth Hurts,” the song started to get its own streaming traction, and Lizzo’s label Atlantic started giving it a push. Ariana Grande appeared on a “Good As Hell” remix last month. And now, with “Good As Hell” sitting at #3 on the Hot 100, we’re getting a new music video, seemingly intended to push it over the top.
“Good As Hell” already had a music video, but the new one is glitzier and not at all related to the movie Barbershop: The Next Cut. In the clip, we see Lizzo practicing and performing with the marching band and the dancers from Southern University, the Baton Rouge HBCU. Lizzo herself started playing flute in marching band in eighth grade, and she went on to study flute at the University Of Houston, so the whole HBCU tradition is important to her. Check out the video below.
“Good As Hell” and “Truth Hurts” have both been added to deluxe editions of Cuz I Love You, and they’re out now on Atlantic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kanye West covers entire body in silver for new opera, 'Mary'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Kanye West debuted the new original opera Mary at the Miami Marine Stadium on Sunday, 8 December while covering his body in silver.
The opera, directed by Vanessa Beecroft, follows on the heels of Nebuchadnezzar, Kanye's first opera, which premiered last month at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.
For the rapper, the opera is a new medium through which to express his commitment to faith and his ever-expanding musical and visual palette according to a statement released to the press.
Mary is an original opera, based on the biblical story of the miraculous events surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ. The Books of Matthew and Luke recount the story of Mary, who was divinely chosen by God to bring forth the Messiah. 
Mary brings together elements from different worlds - including opera, fine art, modern dance, and gospel music - to create a new visual interpretation and innovative performance structure. The stage production is performed by the Sunday Service collective, a ministry formed in January of 2019, in collaboration with Access Opera.
With the Sunday Service Collective working alongside a cast of professional opera singers, Mary represents an innovative interpretation of Kanye's own music, gospel standards, and traditional opera alike.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Strictly's Bruno Tonioli 'reshoots' line over fears he would offend the audience</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the final three couples announced for the Strictly Come Dancing Grand Final next week, there was heartbreak when comedian Chris Ramsey and his pro partner Karen Hauer were eliminated from this weekend's semi-final.
But during last night's results show (8.12.19), judge Bruno Tonioli had to stop and reshoot a line because he feared he would offend the audience.

Chris and Karen - along with Karim Zeroual and his partner Amy Dowden - competed in the dance-off.
As Chris and Karen prepared to re-dance the rumba, The Sun reports that Bruno offered some advice: "It’s not over until the fat lady sings," he said.
But he reportedly asked for a re-shoot, saying: "Oh, I can’t say that any more. You can’t say ‘fat’ on TV."
The publication quotes a source as saying: "Bruno is just conscious about offending people.
"It’s the last thing he’d want to do so it’s better just to be safe.
"The BBC are incredibly sensitive right now. Obviously it’s filtering down to its stars. The audience didn’t have any issue but accepted it’s the new world we’re living in."
ED! has contacted the BBC for comment.

Unfortunately for Chris, 33, the judges unanimously voted to keep Karim and Amy and send them into next week's final.
Already there was EastEnders' Emma Barton and her pro partner Anton Du Beke - making only his second final in 15 years - and ex-Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher and his partner, Oti Mabuse.
Paying tribute to his partner Karen, Chris said: "I'm very proud of myself. I had genuinely no expectations. I thought I'd be gone by week two.
"I've got to thank [Karen]... she's amazing, the best teacher. She's so good at her job, and so patient. So patient!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm A Celebrity: Roman Kemp breaks down watching message from Mum and Dad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An emotional Roman Kemp welled up during I'm A Celebrity's final Extra Camp of the 2019 series as his parents Martin Kemp and Shirlie Holliman paid a loving tribute to their darling son.
Singing star Martin, 58, hailed Roman’s efforts on the ITV jungle reality show as ‘the best television experience’ of his life in a touching moment that left third-placed Roman smiling but overwhelmed.
The Capital Radio DJ put his fist in front of his mouth as he became choked up during his folks' brief address in a short video on the ITV2 spin-off show, with runner up Andy Whyment immediately giving him a hug as Roman took it all in.
"Listen, Ro - we are so proud of you. You have made us laugh, cry. You've just been incredible," his mum began, as both she and Martin beamed with pride.

Spandau Ballet star Martin continued: "You’ve given us such anxiety, too - I can’t tell you. It has been the best television experience of my life."
"We love you so much, Ro. And we can’t wait to see you," added Shirlie.
And as they signed off and Martin raised a hand to salute his son, he added: "Love you, big boy."
On Twitter, Martin had championed his son’s drive for votes to win on Instagram and Twitter throughout Sunday by sharing two heartwarming videos showing Roman as a young boy.

"Congratulations @romankemp so so proud of you!!!" he wrote.
"And thank you so much to EVERYONE who voted for him!!!!"
And after Roman's bronze medal position was confirmed, he made it clear how made up he was for his lad, also thanking fans for their dedicated support.
Talking to Ant and Dec following his departure from the camp, Roman said his stint in the jungle Down Under had been the most moving time he has ever known.
He said: "I’ve never had more fun, I’ve never had so much emotion in my life.
"And it’s a really strange place down there, it’s a really unnatural thing that forms a family within three weeks."
His last day in camp saw him take on his personal biggest fear - which, along with a water-based trial, he had been dreading his entire stay on the show - as he endured the Panic Pit Bushtucker trial.
Buried in an underground chamber, Roman shared the confined space with nearly 60 snakes for ten minutes to win stars for three puddings and a drink as Queen of the Jungle Jac Jossa, Andy and he enjoyed a final slap up meal.
"That was absolutely terrifying," he admitted.

The big winner on the night was acrylic painter ‘Lavish Too Nice’, a talented artist with a brush who won three awards on the night. A few months ago he did a painting of Enzo Ishall on a pair of sneakers that he gave to the Zimdancehall artist when he came to the UK for a show.

Lavish has also won acknowledgement from the likes of UK rappers Stormzy, Michael Dapaah (Big Shaq), Coach K, Krept, Sneakbo among others. Another winner was Zimbabwean music producer Rodney ‘Rymez’ Hwingwiri who has made hits for British rapper/singer Stefflon Don.
The awards, which last year brought singer Baba Harare as their headline performer, were set up to celebrate and recognise exceptional young Zimbabweans in the UK.
The award for Upcoming Musician of the Year was shared between ZimChild and Vimbai Rose, the daughter of the late singer Culture T, (member of reggae outfit Transit Crew). Culture T died in the UK in 2006 and Vimbai’s mother used the time for her speech to remind the crowd of his legacy.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is finally over and Jacqueline Jossa crowned Queen of the Jungle.
In emotional scenes last night (09.12.19), the former EastEnders actress beat Coronation Street's Andy Whyment and radio DJ Roman Kemp to become the winner.

The episode mostly stuck to the usual I'm A Celebrity final format, putting each of the finalists through a last Bushtucker Trial before revealing who had come in third place.
Once Roman had said his goodbyes and done his exit interview, Jac and Andy were brought in for a chat with hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly before the winner was revealed.
But viewers noticed that there were several key changes to the format of the final this year.
Most notably, the remaining celebs didn't get to meet their loved ones in the camp.
Usually, the contestants get to see family members before a winner is crowned and, as it usually makes for emotional viewing, the absence was felt among viewers at home.
Similarly, the way the celebrities exited the jungle appeared to have been switched up.
When Jacqueline walked across the bridge holding her wooden sceptre and wearing her laurel crown, she rushed tearfully into the arms of her husband, Dan Osborne.
But when Roman crossed the bridge, viewers didn't get to see him greeted by a loved one, while the scene of Andy walking across wasn't shown at all.
On Twitter, viewers wondered why the key scenes appeared to have been cut from the final episode.
One said: "No one met Roman at the end of the bridge? I'm sure the majority of lasses in the UK would have #ImACeleb."
Another wrote: "If I knew no one was going to meet Roman at the end of the bridge, I could have taken their place #ImACeleb."
A third tweeted, "Andy doesn't get his walk off across the bridge?" with a sad face emoji.
Someone else said: "This whole experience meant so much to Andy and he doesn't even get to walk over the bridge because he came second."
"Gutted that the families didn't go into I'm A Celeb this year," wrote a fifth.
Another said: "Feel like the final's been quite rushed this year, they didn't even have their families surprise them in the jungle #ImACeleb."
"Just realised that none of the celebs got to see their families a few days before they would've finished," said someone else, adding for clarity: "You know, when they get surprised?"
ED! contacted ITV for comment and an I'm A Celebrity spokesperson said: "Families entering the jungle is a show format point that we don't do every year, unlike letters from home and celebrity cyclone."

There was another key change to the final format that viewers didn't seem happy about.
After Jacqueline was named Queen of the Jungle, fans of the show were naturally expecting last year's King, football manager Harry Redknapp, to hand the crown over to the new winner.
But instead, Extra Camp hosts Emily Atack, Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas brought it out.

For many, it must be appalling, even more, repulsive that South African born, Zozibini Tunzi, is currently the reigning Miss Universe.‘ Why?’
Since time immemorial, being light-skinned and having straight long hair has been the archetype of what beauty is,. Consequently, many enterprises have profiteered from the misconstrued belief and thus, pumping the African markets with skin lightening and hair straightening products to reinforce the stereotype of beauty.  Blame this on colonisation. but that is a conversation for another day.
So it wouldn’t seem bonkers to be surprised how the South African black beauty, who, rocking her short kinky hair, clenched the crown at the worlds largest pageant show.
This was even echoed in her speech made at the Tyler Perry  Studios, Georgia, America, where the Pageant was held.
Check out some photos of the women Zozibini was up against, This was no easy feat as these women are very beautiful in their own ways.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leyland community hub reopens to public with free Christmas dinners for the over 65s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A group of Leyland charity trustees are celebrating the revival of a vital community hub by serving up free Christmas dinners for the over 65s.
They will host the celebration on Saturday, December 14, at Moss Side Community Centre in Dunkirk Lane, Leyland, from noon to 4pm.
The Moss Side Community Forum took over the reigns of the building at the end of last month and plan to use it to serve the needs of the community and bring people together.
Trustee Loretta Whiteley said: "It needs to be the heart of the community again, especially as we have a fractured society.
"There are so many lonely people out there and it absolutely breaks my heart. When I was growing up, there were a lot of elderly people but they were never alone. Time's have changed and somewhere along the line we've lost that but there's so much we can do.
"I know if a resident was in trouble there'd be a rally cry so that community spirit is certainly there. It just needs strengthening."
The team decided to host the free dinners to reach out to elderly residents in the area.
"We don't want them to feel lonely. We want to get to know them and cover every facet of the community, from toddlers to the elderly. For us, this is a great way to open the centre," Loretta added.
A singer and raffle will entertain the diners while a two-course meal will be served up.
The centre has been closed for four and a half months but during that time it remained the home to several groups, including Scouts, folk dancers and a drama academy.
But Loretta said the trustees plan to serve as many people as possible. They hope to become involved with Alzheimer Society's Dementia Friends programme and South Ribble Borough Council's "holiday hunger" scheme.
They are also exploring the possibility of opening the hub on weekends to offer a community cafe where people struggling with loneliness can make new friends.
"It has so much potential that's never been tapped into as there's never been a lot of events going on there historically. In the four years since I moved back here from London, I've walked past it everyday and I didn't know until recently that it was a community centre," Loretta said.
"We just want to create a hub where everyone can feel welcome, regardless of their age, race or gender."
She added: "Since we received the keys it's been absolute bedlam but a lovely bedlam. It's a great feeling to be back in there and I've never been more proud to sign my name against something.
"It's an honour to be part of this project - we're not doing it for the glory. It's just so exciting. We're like a bunch of giddy children and the future of the building is so bright."
To book a Christmas meal, ring Loretta on 01772 624126.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Image Source: Tarah Chieffi
Legend says that the town of Santa Claus, IN, got its name during a town meeting more than 150 years ago. While debating what the town should be called, a gust of wind blew open the doors of the building where the townspeople were gathered and the sound of bells was heard. A child yelled, "It's Santa Claus," and the name stuck. It may take a sliver of faith to believe that story, but that is just what Pat Koch, Chief Elf of Santa Claus, IN, thinks we need a little more of in this world. That is why, each year, Pat and her team of volunteer elves spend countless hours answering the tens of thousands of letters to Santa that come in to the Santa Claus Post Office from all around the world.
Children's letters to Santa have been routed to the Santa Claus Post Office since the early 1900s, with Postmaster James Martin being the first person on record to answer the letters back in 1914. Years later, Pat's father, Jim Yellig (who also played Santa at the local theme park and other regional and national events), took over the growing responsibility of responding to kids' Christmas hopes and wishes. Today, the family legacy has been passed down to Pat, who, at 88 years old, can't bear to see even one letter to Santa go unanswered.

With upwards of 25,000 letters received to the Santa Claus Post Office each year, Pat relies heavily on a team of volunteers and donors to keep the program running. "With Thanksgiving being late in the month this year, we already have a stack of 3,000 letters waiting to be answered. It varies by day, but in total we have close to 100 volunteers who help respond to the letters," Pat told POPSUGAR. There are regular volunteers and individuals who come in when they have time, but there are also a number of local businesses, school clubs, and charitable organizations who volunteer year to year to ensure every single letter is read and responded to with a personalized note "so they know that Santa read their letter." Letters comes in from as far as Germany, Sweden, China, and even Russia. For these, Pat's team turns to local foreign exchange students who can read and respond to the letters in each child's native language.
With so many letters passing through, there are always common themes that stand out. Pat said, "Last year, everybody wanted Hatchimals and slime. Some of our younger volunteers help keep us up-to-date on the newest toys that kids are asking for." Children also have a lot of questions for Santa. "They want to know his favorite color, which cookies he likes best, and even what he does when he needs a restroom break on Christmas Eve."

These letters give everybody a good laugh, but there are always a handful of letters from kids questioning whether Santa is even real. "You can tell these children want to believe. It would be horrible to see these letters go unanswered. To see that children still have faith, belief, awe, and wonder is what keeps us going," Pat said. "With so much drama in life, we could all use a little more faith and happiness. Even adults write to Santa asking for family togetherness, peace, and love. We have so much fun answering these letters and helping to bring a little more joy and peace into the world."
Even with the overwhelming number of letters they already have on their hands, Pat and her elves are happy to answer as many letters as they receive. If you happen to be in the Santa Claus, IN, area, you can stop by the original Santa Claus Post Office and have your kids write and deliver their letters onsite. If not, you can send your letter to Santa Claus, P.O. Box 1, Santa Claus, IN, 47579. While they do receive generous monetary donations each year, they welcome any small donation of money, stamps, or a self-addressed stamped envelope that you'd like to include with your letter. In order to receive a response before Christmas, they ask that all letters be received by Dec. 20, and if you have a large group or class that would like to participate, the sooner you can send them the better.

By the looks of it, this workshop won't be shutting down anytime soon. Pat's own daughter and grandchildren are already joining in to keep the tradition going. What's possibly most magical about all of this, Pat told us, is that "If our town wasn't called Santa Claus, this wouldn't be happening." Whether or not those were Santa's bells ringing outside that town meeting so many years ago, children the world over are lucky that one little girl believed.

The late Big Bird puppeteer died on the same day 'Sesame Street' became the first TV series ever to receive the award for lifetime achievement in the arts.
Caroll Spinney was remembered by his Sesame Street co-stars at the 42nd Annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in Washington, D.C., on Sunday. The late children’s television legend, best known as the voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, died at age 85 on the same day Sesame Street became the first television series to receive the award for lifetime achievement in the arts.
Sesame Workshop co-founders Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett were on hand to accept the prestigious award during the bittersweet ceremony. The duo accepted the honor on behalf of Muppets creator Jim Henson, puppeteers Caroll Spinney and Frank Oz, and all the other artists who have worked on the show, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Cast members from the series also honored Spinney, who was a fixture on the long-running PBS children’s show from 1969 until his retirement last year. Iconic Sesame Street Muppets Ernie and Bert, as well as Big Bird (portrayed by Matt Vogel since 2018), appeared at the event, according to Page Six.
Vogel paid tribute to his mentor Spinney in a touching Instagram post hours before he headed to the ceremony.
In a poignant tribute, Sesame Street cast members David Rudman (Cookie Monster), Leslie Carrara-Rudolph (Abby Cadabby), Ryan Dillon (Elmo), Peter Linz (Ernie) and Eric Jacobson (Bert) wore yellow feathers pinned to their chests as they attended the prestigious ceremony with their puppets in hand.
In addition, Sesame Street veteran Sonia Manzano, who played Maria on Sesame Street from 1971 to 2015, expressed sadness over the death of her longtime friend and co-star.
“I’m heartbroken that this happened on this particular day,” Manzano said. “But I’m glad we’re all together.”
On the red carpet, Elmo puppeteer Ryan Dillon described Spinney as “an incredible person” and his biggest inspiration.
“We’re still reeling a little bit and I think the world is going to miss what he brought to it,” the Sesame Street puppeteer said. “He’s here tonight. He’s here tonight.”
Rudman said he knew Spinney for 20 years and that he was a “genius” and a “sweet man.” The Cookie Monster voice actor praised his late Sesame Street co-star’s talent and said he will always miss him.

Kennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein addressed Spinney’s death before the second half of the awards presentation.
“We are all saddened by his loss and the tribute tonight to Sesame Street is in his honor,” Rubenstein told the audience.
CBS’s upcoming Kennedy Center Honors television special will include a special segment in honor of Caroll Spinney, per the Los Angeles Times. CBS entertainment vice president Jack Sussman said a special tribute to the late Sesame Street icon will be produced and added to the TV broadcast set to air on December 15.

What's up witches, Netflix have revealed Chilling Adventures of Sabrina will return for its third season on January 24.
They announced the news on the show's official Twitter account over the weekend.
"Knock knock knock on the gates of hell. See you Jan 24, witches."
In case you've forgotten, season two saw Sabrina trap Lucifer in Nick's body - sending him back to hell.
According to Entertainment Weekly, the new season will see Sabrina attempt to save her beloved boyfriend Nick.
Now that the Dark Lord has been unseated, there's nobody sitting on hell's throne and people are beginning to fight for the position, with Sabrina becoming one of them.
 Sabrina must assume the title of Queen against the Prince of Hell Caliban.
While that's happening in hell, the people of Greendale are facing their own demons.
The show's description reads: "A mysterious carnival rolls into town, bringing with it a threat to the Spellmans and the coven: A tribe of pagans looking to resurrect an ancient evil."
Just 46 days to go.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What an achievement. 
Thanks to a record number of billion dollar blockbusters, Disney has become the first studio in history to surpass $10 billion at the worldwide box office.
Variety are reporting that Disney is imminently set to become the first studio to move beyond the $10 billion mark.
As of Sunday, the current total is at around $9.997 billion, made up $3.28 billion in North America and $6.7 billion in the rest of the world.
This year's Avengers: Endgame ($2.798 billion global takings) and The Lion King live action remake ($1.656 billion) contributed a huge chunk to the milestone, which will be made official before Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens in the next fortnight.
Variety notes that recent Fox films - with that empire acquired by Disney in March - such as Dark Phoenix and Le Mans '66 don't count towards the overall total, otherwise they'd be up at around $11.9 billion.
2019 has been a colossal year for the studio, with five films crossing the billion dollar mark at the box office, Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and Captain Marvel.
As of last weekend, Frozen 2 has clocked in at $920 billion and will almost certainly make it a sixth. As noted, Star Wars is nearly here too.
Meanwhile, Disney have released a brand new trailer for the live action remake of Mulan.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This would be a tricky one for the Kop to blare out in unison, but how good would it sound?!
Andy Robertson’s current song is a pretty easy one to remember – and anyone who’s been to Anfield over the past 18 months will have head ‘Oh, Andy Andy!’ sung at one point…
But how about this remix of Gerry Cinnammon’s classic ‘Belter’ as seen in the video below?
It’s a quality song, and suits Robbo perfectly as the original singer is a very well-loved Scot, too.
“And when he plays the Blue Sh*te he will leave the elbow in, he’s Andy Robbo…” is a particular favourite line of ours! 
Props to the lad in the video:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rosanna Davison reveals meaning behind baby Sophia’s name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Miss World Rosanna Davison has revealed the meaning behind her newborn daughter’s adorable name.
Taking to Instagram, the new mother shared some more insight into her surrogacy journey after welcoming a baby girl in late November with husband Wes Quirke.
“It’s been 24 hours since we brought baby Sophia home from Kiev, she’s settled in really well & has been getting to know her grandparents & furry big brothers,” she wrote.
The 35-year-old revealed she began her journey to gestational surrogacy in Kiev, Ukraine.“Back when we began the medical & legal side of #oursurrogacyjourney in Feb 2018, we never dreamed that we’d be lucky enough to take our beautiful daughter home for Christmas the very next year.”Opening up about the process, Rosanna said it was “long, stressful and expensive.”“It’s a long, stressful, expensive process and there are no absolute guarantees.”
 At the beginning of this year, we spent a few weeks in Kiev for the egg retrieval process & stayed beside St. Sophia’s Cathedral,” she said, explaining her daughter’s namesake.
“The night before my procedure, we walked up to the cathedral in the freezing cold & Wes Quirke took this photo… we both loved the name & agreed that if we happened to have a baby girl, we’d name her Sophia as a nod to our long journey to become her parents (it also comes from the Greek word for wisdom!)”
Rosanna concluded her heartfelt post by thanking everyone who “supported, guided and helped” over the “past couple of years,” adding; “you know who you are.”
“So here we are! In a magical baby bubble at the most wonderful time of the year.”“We’ll be forever grateful to the many people who have supported, guided & helped us over the last couple of years – you know who you are.”
The couple returned home with their daughter over the weekend as they prepare for the upcoming Christmas holiday period.

During a recent performance at international rapper, Cardi B’s concert, in Lagos, Nigeria, Burna Boy pledged he would bring the award home and after that there would be a cause for celebration.
In his words, he said:
Burna’s album African Giant, was nominated in the World Best Music Album, alongside fellow African legendary singer, Angelique Kidjo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonakshi Sinha On Playing Female Dabangg: “There Aren’t Enough Producers To Take Such Risk”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha is gearing up for the release of Dabangg 3 alongside superstar Salman Khan. While she is busy promoting the film, she answered the biggest questio, to whether there will be a female Dabangg ever! Below is what she has to say.
During the promotions, Sonakshi spoke about how there are not enough producers who are willing to take risks with female-oriented films with the same budget as for a male one. This in turn led to the question of whether Dabangg will ever see a female cop.
“No. There’s still a long way to go. I’ve done so many solo lead films but the budgets are nowhere closer to what they are for the male superstars. Of course, that’s also because the returns that they get but then that depends on the audience,” Sonakshi told PTI
Sonakshi also stressed on how the audience also needs to bring in the change. If the audience is receptive of the films led by women the same way male ones enjoy, it is possible.
When asked if there are producers ready to bankroll such a film, Sonakshi said, “No there aren’t enough people to take that risk. Which is why it’s not happening.”
Talking about her character Rajjo, that she is rebooting for the third time, the actress said, “Rajjo will always be special to me because I began my career playing her. I can play Rajjo in my sleep. I just have to wear the saree, put on those flowers in my hair and I become her. I know the beats of Rajjo so well.”
Directed by Prabhudheva, Dabangg 3 starring Salman, Sonakshi and debutant Saiee Manjarekar and set to release on December 20 this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It came as a great shocker earlier this year when Dia Mirza called her relation off with her husband Sahil Sangha. She expressed her views on social media and didn’t forget to mention that the decision was mutual.
As soon Dia Mirza updated her followers about such an important decision of her life, there was a long list of speculations doing the rounds amongst netizens, spilling the reasons about the separation.
Now, in a recent interview with Hindustan Times, Dia opened up about her life post that ‘impactful’ decision. “Any major life change is challenging, painful and difficult but the work is cathartic. This is what helps you grow and keeps your pursuit of happiness alive,” she quotes.
Dia adds further quoting, “I am fortunate that the kind of work that I do gives me the opportunity to deal with the pain better. I want to just go out there and keep finding my voice and keep empowering myself and others.”
She also revealed her new production house titled One India Stories and told the story behind it. “I chose this name because one means everybody and India has my name. I want to backstories that connect to all of us, bring people together, influence and impact positive change to grow to learn and share that discovery and learning,” she quotes.
The former beauty queen also has a production company, Born Free Entertainment Private Limited, which she had launched along with her ex-husband Sahil Sangha in 2011.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Video: How angry fans threw bottles on stage at Cardi B’s concert</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was and still an uproar on social media following the so-called Ghanaian celebrities who were snubbed by American female rapper, Cardi B during her visit to Ghana over the weekend.
It wasn’t her inability to meet the so-called celebrities which were the disappointment of the day, the show also experienced some glitches and this got people who were eager to experience a lifetime concert.
Cardi B’s Livespot festival which was held at the Accra Sports Stadium experienced delays which compelled angry fans to throw bottles on the stage.
In videos making waves on the Internet, fans had to wait for over a period of 1 hour before the next performance and that led to the throwing of bottles on the stage.
Apparently, things were really not organised to meet the expectations of fans and music lovers who trooped into the stadium to watch various performances from top Ghanaian musicians as well as Cardi B.
Cardi B saved the night when she jumped on the stage and thrilled fans with her energetic performances with dancers.

The year was almost set to end on a high note. And yet yesterday, news broke that Chicago rapper Juice WRLD had passed away after suffering from a seizure at an airport. The sudden shock sent the entire music industry into disarray, with homages stemming from fans, friends, and collaborators alike. With circumstances surrounding his death remaining mysterious as of this moment, many looked to seek solace in his music. With a catalog ranging in different styles, some of his more melancholic and emotional-driven songs proved to be particularly powerful in retrospect.
In many ways, his response to XXXTentacion and Lil Peep's death "Legends" feels like a fitting tribute. Especially given the eerily accurate moments of foreshadowing, in which Juice reimagines the "27 Club" as the "21 Club," mirroring his own fate with startling accuracy. "We ain't making it past 21," he sings, over haunting production from TakeADayTrip and Russel Chen. Given the circumstances, it might not be easy to listen to "Legends," but it remains notable in its prophetic nature. Perhaps someone will pick up where he left off and pen a similar tribute in his honor. Rest in peace, Juice WRLD.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Ozzy Osbourne has offered a $25,000 reward for the return of his late friend Randy Rhoads’ stolen guitars.
The 71-year-old rocker took to social media to offer the reward for information leading to an arrest in the case and the return of the items, which were stolen from the Musonia School of Music in North Hollywood, California last month (November 2019), reports aceshowbiz.com.
Sharing photographs of the stolen instruments on Instagram, the Black Sabbath rocker wrote: “As many of you have heard, the Musonia School of Music in N. Hollywood, CA (the school where Randy Rhoads famously taught guitar) was viciously robbed on Thanksgiving night.”
“Musonia was run by Randy’s late mother, Delores, and after his death 37 years ago, the school became something of a pilgrimage to his fans from all over the world. It is a place where the Rhoads Family happily opened their hearts to share the life of Randy.”
“As you can imagine, the items that were stolen, including Randy’s first electric guitar, are irreplaceable to the Rhoads Family.”
Osbourne then shared he was personally “heartbroken” over the thefts and the damage caused at the school by the trespassing thieves.
Rhoads learned to play guitar at Musonia, which is now run by his brother, Kelle Rhoads. The school also doubles up as the Randy Rhoads Museum.
The young star was killed in 1982, at the age of 25, when the small plane in which he was a passenger crashed after clipping Osbourne’s tour bus in Leesburg, Florida. Two others died during the tragic incident.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Remembering Juice WRLD's Art Of Freestyling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday morning, the loss of Jarad Anthony Higgins, known to millions of fans as Juice WRLD, sent a ripple effect through the community. Fellow artists and listeners alike penned eulogies and homages, highlighting the impact of his creativity and content. For many, his emo-inspired take on rap bridged the gap between genre barriers, widening the scope of his impact to a variety of demographics. And while many of his more popular singles ranging from “Robbery,” “Lucid Dreams,” and “All Girls Are The Same” centered around melancholic melodies, Juice’s sensibilities as an emcee garnered a unique type of respect from his contemporaries.
In a heartfelt Instagram post, fellow lyricist YBN Cordae paid respects to his friend, highlighting a commonality between them. “We shared the same bus,(your bus lol) and never slept cuz we'd be up freestyling for HOURS,” he wrote. “Since then a lifelong brotherhood was built.” A bond forged through a mutual appreciation for hip-hop music and the art of lyricism, Juice WRLD and Cordae’s friendship served to highlight one of the former’s status as a student of the game. If it wasn’t always apparent from his musical choices, his admiration and aptitude for the act of freestyling was proof in itself. His sheer prowess in that department was enough to make a believer out of hip-hop media’s favorite stoic, Funkmaster Flex. The old-head archetype in his final form, Flex’s face could only contort with pleasure as Juice delivered bar-after-bar, many of which appeared to be rattled off-top.
While Juice WRLD’s prolific work ethic led to many musical memories preserved, perhaps none shine brighter than his impressive stop on Tim Westwood TV. In a clip that has since garnered over five million views, Juice WRLD rapped for fifty-two minutes straight over some of Eminem’s most popular beats, going completely off the dome. A feat that not many emcees would dare attempt, let alone pull off with quotables to match. For many, this video will serve as a reminder of Juice’s talent, of what separated him from others in his class. To be sitting on such keen lyrical instincts, using them sparingly and thus, making them all the more impressive. His preservation of a seemingly lost art--the unwritten freestyle--speaks to a mentality well beyond his years. Clearly, Juice WRLD held an appreciation for the culture’s foundational roots and his predecessors.
The aforementioned “hour-long freestyle” has been embedded below, a bittersweet reminder of the young man’s legacy. Between the flow-switches, eerily foreshadowing lyrics, the palpable sense of fun, and the endearing lulls as he concocts his next move, Juice’s freestyle clinic may very well stand as a defining artistic moment. Even when his lyrics bridge the topic of death, which certainly hurts given the circumstances, his clear sense of enjoyment is a strong enough counterweight. Rest in peace, Juice WRLD. One of the best freestylers we’ve seen in recent memory.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Controversial Screen goddess Rosemond Brown popularly known as Akuapem poloo finally had her prayers of meeting with American pop star Cardi B answered when the latter was in Ghana yesterday 8th December 2019.
Cardi B was slated to have a  meet and greet session with some Ghanaian celebrities at 2:30 pm yesterday ahead of her stadium concert but things didn’t go as planned.
This caused the celebrities to take to social media to vent out their displeasure of waiting in vain for the American star. The likes  of Afia Schwarzenegger, Hajia4real amongst others took a swipe at Cardi B for keeping them waiting while eating Khebab.
Cardi B finally came out to meet with the celebrities  and apologized for keeping them waiting explaining that she was not in the known that she had a meet and greet session.
As predictable as Akuapem poloo is, she didn’t hold back in showing off her twerking skills to Cardi B who joined her in dancing.
As the dancing was going on, Akuapem poloo’s wig came off and she quickly took it and run off causing a loud laughter among the audience present.
Well the most important thing is, Akuapem poloo finally had the chance to meet her mentor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brahmastra: This Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt Film DELAYED Yet AGAIN, To Now Release In Winter 2020; Know Why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like all the Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt fans will have to wait for a little longer as reports suggest that Brahmastra has been once again postponed to winter 2020
It looks like Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt’s upcoming fantasy drama – Brahmastra – is one highly jinxed project, and we aren’t just saying it. The film, which was initially slated to release in December this month, got pushed to summer 2020 citing some heavily pending VFX work. And now, if the recent report in Bollywood Hungama is anything to go by, Brahmastra has been postponed further to winter 2020, i.e., almost the end of next year.  A source close to the film’s development told the portal that this time, too, VFX is the cause behind the delay. (ALSO READ - Brahmastra: Lovebirds Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt Strike A Serious Pose In The Icy Hills Of Manali – PICS)
The source said, "A major chunk of VFX is still pending which includes the stuff shot with Shah Rukh Khan at a studio in Mumbai, and the plot that unfolds in Manali and Varanasi. The company working on the visual effects has conveyed to the producers that they won't be able to get the film ready by summer due to complexities in the visual effects, which have come across as a shock to everyone working on the film.” They added how Karan Johar and Ayan Mukerji aren’t keen on treating audiences with a half-baked product and hence giving their best to the film’s visual effects.
Further, the source stated how Karan and Ayan are confident that once Brahmastra’s trailer and the teaser are dropped online, fans will be blown away by its spectacular visuals. Once the team gets a thumbs up from the VFX department, they will be officially announcing Brahmastra’s new release date with a poster or a teaser. We wait!
Brahmastra also stars Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna and Mouni Roy in pivotal roles.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpotboyE.com has been bringing to you all the goss from inside the STAR Screen Awards 2019, which unfolded last night. Here's another one about Urvashi Rautela and Taapsee Pannu
Actresses and their cat fights form an integral part of Bollywood. While not even one openly accept that they have issues and usually give the "we're friends" tag, yet updates about things going sour between them don't stop coming. 
You may recall, a few days back, reports said that Taapsee Pannu feels Urvashi Rautela needs a new stylist. The comment made a lot of headlines and Urvashi's fans also got upset with Taapsee's statement, mocking the Paagalpani actress' fashion mantra. 
However, last night, something absolutely interesting happened at the STAR Screen Awards 2019. Who would have thought that the ladies will end up sitting next to each other at the function? We bring to you an EXCLUSIVE picture of the same.
That's right. When Urvashi walked in at the awards show, she was told that her seat is next to Taapsee's. Now, she did not make a fuss about it and quietly accepted to sit besides Taapsee, in spite of latter's comment on her styling. We don't know what the Pink actress was feeling about it though. 
Now, after seeing what Urvashi was wearing yesterday at the awards nite, we really hope Taapsee gave the same suggestion to her face to face.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kartik Aaryan is soaring high as his latest release Pati Patni Aur Woh is successfully entertaining the audience in theatres. The film is based on the lines of cheating and from what Kartik Aaryan has revealed in his latest interview, we think he doesn’t mind cheating on a person in real life as well.
Well, Kartik Aaryan made some shocking statements when asked about relationships that may leave you speechless as well. According to the Pati Patni Aur Woh star, it isn’t cheating if one finds some other girl cute while being in a relationship. He revealed that he has been attracted to someone else while he was dating a girl and he does not consider it to be cheating on her.
While interacting with Times Now, he said, “I have been in a relationship and I have got attracted to someone else? Yes, I have! Emotional cheating should never be the case. Physical cheating too shouldn’t be the case. But emotional is worse. So in attraction, it isn’t cheating because you feel she’s cute then it’s okay. It’s better if it doesn’t go beyond that.”
Well, this is not the first time we have seen Kartik make such shocking revelations about his personal life. Earlier he had said, “Acting and sex are like bread and butter. You can’t quit either. Acting and sex or love go hand in hand for me. I don’t like talking about my personal life but I don’t like hiding it also.”
On the work front, Kartik Aaryan will be next seen in Bhool Bhulaiyya 2. The film also stars Kiara Advani and Tabu in pivotal roles. Kartik has also been roped in for Dostana 2. The film stars Janhvi Kapoor and Lakshya.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serena O’Dwyer from Cashel receives Gold Gaisce Award</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The President of Ireland's award ceremony took place in Dublin Castle.
The awards were presented by President Michael D Higgins in a prestigious ceremony hosted by Sinead Burke.
Serena O’Dwyer received her bronze and silver award as a pupil of Cashel Community School and started her Gaisce journey to the gold award in sixth year under the guidance of her President Award Leader Irene Codd.
The Gold Award requires participants to undertake five challenges.
Serena volunteered in Uganda for the residential element.
For her adventure journey she undertook a four-day walk along the Wild Atlantic Way, she volunteered as a mentor in a Big Brother Big Sister program where she assisted a young lady from a disadvantaged background.
To keep fit for her physical section Serena chose dancing and finally for her personal skill she took singing lessons.
Cashel Community School would like to congratulate Serena on this fantastic achievement. Her tenacity to complete all the requirements of the award is to be commended.
The Gaisce Gold Award challenge is not an easy one – it demands motivation, determination and focus over a minimum of 52 weeks but in most cases takes a number of years to complete.
This achievement not only demonstrates a personal determination, but also a commitment to the service of her community.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American rapper, Cardi B’s arrival in the nation’s capital has really left most celebrities and Ghanaians alike in pains as some of them were snubbed in a supposed ‘meet and greet’ with her at the Kempinski hotel.
Self-acclaimed Ghanaian celebrities like Afia Schwarzenegger, Akuapem poloo, Hajia4real, and others who could not meet the international star after over five hours took to social media to express their displeasure but Cardi B in a response via Instagram live poured out her frustration after she was wrongly accused of being arrogant by the so-called slay queens disguised under the mask of celebrities.
During the ongoing brouhaha, Ghanaians trooped micro-blogging platform, Twitter to express their disappointment in the slayqueens for disgracing Ghana in such a manner.
Check out some social media reactions below:
The 27-year-old international star is widely known for her music hits like, ‘Bodak Yellow’, which topped Billboard Hot 100 charts.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Exes Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh are a part of Bigg Boss 13 and it is given that there will be clashes between the two. Today, we shall see them dragging their past and throwing some nasty accusations at each other
Chandrakanta stars Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh were once deeply in love with each other. However, they had a very nasty breakup and soon they turned enemies. They appeared on a dance reality show together as exes, and they couldn't stop screaming at each other. Now, the same has followed to Bigg Boss 13 house. Madhurima who entered as a wild card contestant last week will have a massive showdown with her ex Vishal Aditya Singh today. So much that they'll start screaming at each other and even start abusing.
In the promo shared, we see Madhurima confronting Vishal over how he treats women. She said that he did not treat his girlfriend right and that he has no right to advice others on how they should deal with women. Vishal then goes on to talk about how abusive Madhurima was while in a relationship and that she even slapped him in front of everyone. Vishal says she shouldn't have come to Bigg Boss as her entry has made him uncomfortable and that's when Madhuri says 'Tumhare Baap Ka Show Hai?' The lady calls Vishal 'fake' while he calls her 'worthless'. Watch the video below:
Well, this has left us pretty confused as just a few hours ago we saw Vikas Gupta trying to mend things between Vishal and Madhurima. In fact, in a video, we also saw the lady walking up to Vishal in the night with a motive to talk. We were hoping that things will get sorted between the two, but, now it seems highly unlikely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Myles Stephenson Reveals What He Said To Jacqueline In The Jungle & Admits He's 'Not Scared' Of Dan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm A Celeb's Myles Stephenson opens up about what was said between himself and Jacqueline Jossa in the jungle.
It's after reports emerged that he told her that he believes her husband Dan Osborne had an affair with his ex Gabby Allen.
The Sun reports that soon after, Dan allegedly told his friends that he wants to, 'knock [Myles'] head off.'
Myles' response to this is, 'I’ve grown up with much scarier people than Dan.'
The Rak-Su member opens up to The Sun following his I'm A Celeb eviction.
When told about Dan's alleged threats, Myles says, 'It’s an immature response.'
'If you know you’ve done no wrong, why would you want to knock someone’s head off?'
Myles continues, 'He shouldn’t get his back up. It makes him look bitter and stupid.'
'If he wants to come and try and knock my head off it won’t end well.'
'One of us is going to end up in the nick and nobody needs that.'
When this interview took place last week, Myles was staying in the same hotel as Dan in Australia.
At this point, they hadn't come face to face.
He tells the outlet, 'He’s got two kids here. He should be looking after them.'
The singer believes Dan should knock on his door and talk to him.
'He’s here. He knew I was coming out of the jungle and he could’ve knocked on my door.'
'I’d have let him in. I’ve grown up with much scarier people than Dan.'
'I’m not scared of a thing.'
He goes on, 'You can make threats, it means nothing. This isn’t a game. I’m sitting here with my family now.'
'If you’re walking around all heated, in the foyer, we’re going to cross paths.'
Myles reveals what he said to Jacqueline in the jungle.
'There was a moment in camp when Jac asked about the situation.'
'I said to her, ‘Look, we’re not going to talk about it now. We’re in front of about 150 cameras right now’.'
He explains that she quizzed him even further when they were on their way to a Bushtucker Trial.
'I spoke to her about it. I told her what I thought about the situation.'
And he admits, 'I told her what I’ve seen.'
He goes on, 'I told her, 'I’m only telling you because you’re already a sister to me.' If it was the other way, I’d want to know.'
'I also went on to tell her that, at the end of the day, I’m not a spiteful person.'
It sounds like the Rak-Su member has decided to take a step back.
'I spoke to Jac about it and said, ‘Whatever you decide to take from what I’ve told is down to you and Dan.''
'I’ve got nothing against him. I said to her that if he tried something with me, it could go sour.'
'I’m not going to stand there and take punches, I’m going to fight back, but if he wants to talk, we can talk.'
Thankfully, it looks like Myles and Dan have gotten past their differences.
A source tells MailOnline that they met and have, 'cleared the air of any misunderstandings that have been reported.'
In pictures obtained by the outlet, the pair were pictured laughing poolside in Australia.
These allegations are the least of Dan's worries.
He's fighting off claims he had a threesome with Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling last year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yash went on to become a much-popular name among Tamil cine buffs with KGF: Chapter 1, the blockbuster Kannada movie, which was well-accepted all across India. While audiences are looking forward to the sequel to the film, Yash fans are eager to know whether he will be dubbing for himself in the Tamil version of this upcoming movie.
At a recent award function in Chennai, the actor took to the stage and addressed the audience in Tamil. He asked the audiences whether his Tamil is fine and added whether he could dub for himself in KGF: Chapter 2. Rocking Star mentioned that he will be crazier in the sequel and there will be more madness. His words have given an assurance that KGF: Chapter 2 will be even more special. The actor's words regarding the upcoming movie has left the fans pretty much excited.
In KGF, Yash plays the role of the protagonist named Rocky Bhai. The star's fan base increased numerous folds with this movie, which tasted huge success in Tamil as well. His performance in the film was loved by one and all. Most recently, a report also had come in that KGF: Chapter 1 emerged as one among the most-viewed Tamil movies on Amazon Prime. This would rightly sum up the popularity the film has enjoyed among Tamil movie audiences.
KGF has been directed by Prasanth Neel. The shoot of the sequel is currently progressing and Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt has been roped in to play the main antagonist. There are humungous expectations on this movie, which is also one among the most-anticipated films among the Tamil movie audiences as well. The film is expected to release in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Earl of Yarmouth and his wife who were 'evicted' from the family's £85million estate by his aunt and parents reveals he 'regrets' the bitter row because his siblings are no longer speaking to him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Earl and Countess of Yarmouth have defended their decision to speak out against his family, after claiming they evicted him following a fallout in the summer.
William Francis Seymour, 26, revealed in July how his family asked him to leave the cottage on the estate called The Bothy that he was living in with his then-pregnant wife Kelsey Wells, a city high-flyer, 34.
As the firstborn son to Hugh Seymour, 8th Marquess of Hertford, William is heir to the £85m estate Ragley Hall, a magnificent Palladian mansion set in 5,000 acres, and has now said his three siblings have stopped speaking to him since his decision to speak about the family rift.
William, whose ancestors include Henry VIII’s third wife, Jane Seymour, has now said that he and his wife have no regrets about 'setting the record straight' over the reported campaign of hostility they reportedly faced, which peaked when his aunt Lady Carolyn called him a 'pompous a**' in her RSVP to the couple’s wedding in June last year - even correcting the font and coronet they  used.
Speaking to Tatler, William revealed how his his three siblings, Lady Gabriella Helen Seymour, 28, Lord Edward George Seymour, 24, and Lady Antonia Louisa Seymour, 21, have barely spoken to him in the months after he spoke out against his family. 
Revealing that he just received one brief message from one sister reading 'WTF' following the interview, he said: 'On a personal level one big regret I have about what has been going on with my parents is that it has got in the way of the relationship I could have had with my sisters and brother.'
Ensuring that his son's upbringing would be different from his own, he added: 'I really want to ensure that my son can talk to me about anything and everything.' 
Revealing why they spoke out about their situation, Kelsey, who reportedly gave birth this week, said: ‘The eviction of the Marquess of Hertford’s son from the family estate was not something that would go unnoticed, and rumours were beginning to circulate locally. 
‘We wanted to ensure that the historical record was accurate and felt it was appropriate to tell the real story.’ 
She added: 'I didn't ever see it as marrying into aristocracy. We should not define ourselves by the titles we have, or by association with an estate that one of us might have been fortunate enough to inherit. 
The couple briefly moved into Kelsey's parents' home after being evicted, before settling in a small cottage on the edge of the estate that William inherited from his grandfather. 
Speaking about the cottage they have, he joked: ‘You could fit the entire square footage of this cottage into the Great Hall at Ragley’. 
In July the couple told how the hostility began when William first started dating Kelsey, and his bedroom and car was reportedly lent to other staff members in an 'effort to keep them from seeing each other'.
Kelsey told how she felt as though the family's reported attitude towards her stemmed towards their fear of 'losing control of their son', and says they never warmed to her. 
They then revealed how his aunt had written an astonishing response to their 2018 wedding invite, replying: ‘[It’s] so embarrassingly awful, it’s almost laughable, if it weren’t so tragic. Since when do you start with the groom’s coronet on top of the page?
‘Moreover, you haven’t even used the Ragley blue nor the correct font. And since when does your name come before the bride?’
She went on to berate William for suggesting how guests might dress. ‘Good God, what are you? Little Lord Fauntleroy?’ She then beseeched him to teach his fiancee the rules of etiquette: ‘I am The Lady Carolyn Seymour,’ she said, before signing off: ‘You pompous a**/t**/p***k – take your pick… Your ever-so loving aunt’.
The couple now say they are following in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's footsteps and say they plan to 'thrive, not just survive', and hope to mend bridges with his family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Christmas at Sandringham is REALLY like: From 'viciously competitive' board games to Prince Philip's 'very strong' cocktails, experts reveal how the royal celebrations are 'wonderfully relaxed'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You might think that spending Christmas with the royal family would be a thoroughly formal affair.
But a documentary has revealed that royals celebrating Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham have a lot of fun, with the famous family enjoying 'very strong' cocktails mixed by Prince Philip, and fiercely competitive board games. 
Sandringham: The Queen at Christmas, which aired last night on Channel 5, revealed that the royals arrive at the Norfolk estate on Christmas Eve, with Prince Philip kicking off festivities when he hosts a drink reception at 7.30pm, pouring the tipples himself.  
Royal expert, Ingrid Seward, revealed that the drinks served by the Duke of Edinburgh are 'very strong'.
She said: 'I think the Queen likes a martini, other people would rather have champagne.
'Prince Philip isn't a great drinker, he always used to drink pale ale.
'So they're not great drinkers. But the drinks are very strong. 
'So any one that's a guest would be knocked out by these drinks.'
After the drinks reception, the family consume a candle-lit six-course meal, with the menu presented in French.
Ingrid added: 'Of course nobody goes to bed before the Queen, and of course when Princess Margaret was alive nobody went to bed before her either. So that meant two or three o'clock in the morning.
'There was  a lot of singing and if someone plays the piano well, like Princess Margaret did, they will be very popular.
The royals also take part in the German tradition of sharing gifts on Christmas Eve, a tradition started by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert. 
But rather than the grand gifts you might expect the royal family gifting each other, they in fact compete to buy one another the tackiest, silliest gifts. 
At 6pm precisely the royals are called into Sandringham's drawing room, where they have a 'holy evening' of gift giving and view the gifts as the 'jokier the better', the documentary revealed.
Over the years, the Queen has received a 'Big Mouth Billie Bass' the comical singing fish that hangs on walls, as well as a washing up apron as gifts from her family. 
One year, Prince Harry gifted his brother William a comb, making light of his hair loss, while The Duchess of Cambridge brought her brother-in-law a 'Grow Your Own Girlfriend' kit, before he met his wife Meghan.
The documentary revealed during her first visit at Sandringham, Princess Diana missed the memo and bought Princess Anne a cashmere jumper, only to receive a toilet roll holder in return.
She quickly learned her lesson though, and the following year purchased a leopard print bath mat for Sarah Ferguson. 
There's no lie in for royals after a late night on Christmas Eve, because they are up early on Christmas Day to attend church, with the eyes of the world on them.
But not before opening a stocking and also enjoying breakfast together, where 'everyone serves themselves'. 
All guests, including the Corgis, receive a stocking in the morning which has gifts and fruit from the Queen inside. 
Royal writer Richard Kay added: 'We all think it's a terribly formal, but really they have a  wonderful relaxed time at Sandringham like the rest of us.
He added the the family regularly play charades and party games.
'The Queen is a very good mimic and did a wonderful Margaret Thatcher impression years ago,' he continued. 
Claudia Joseph, Royal Author added: 'Prince Andrew once said they don't play monopoly as it gets too vicious, as they're all so competitive'.  
After church,  the royals head back to the main house and enjoy a full Christmas dinner with all the trimmings, including mashed potatoes with cream and butter, sauteed parsnips with Parmesan,  carrots, stuffing, gravy and Brussels sprouts served with onion and shredded bacon.
Following dinner, the whole family watches the Queen's Christmas message together.  
Most of the family leave on Boxing Day and make their way to see other parts of their family over the festive period, after taking part in the annual Boxing Day shoot.
The Queen and Prince Philip stay at the Norfolk Estate until early February, to mark the anniversary of George VI's death. 
The Queen's father died on the estate in 1952. 
While a lot of festive fun is had on the estate, the tradition begins before the royals arrive, with Prince Philip decorating the tree and strict pecking order dictating which royals arrive first.
The most junior royals are the first guest, followed by the higher-ranking family members, with Prince Charles and Camilla arriving last. 
While the Queen approves royal decorations at all official residences, Prince Philip will always put the gold star on top of the tree. 
Royal commentator Dickie Arbiter revealed: 'The tree is decorated in much the same way as people throughout the United Kingdom decorate their tree.
'You've got the baubles, the tinsel, the coloured lights.'  
Royal expert, Claudia Joseph, added: 'Prince Philip will always put the gold star on the top of the tree, and probably will continue to do so for the rest of his life.
'He's quite a stalwart and won't let other people take control.
'When any young children come they put their own decorations on.'  
The Queen also makes sure all her staff are looked after, and personally signs a Chrsitmas card to all staff.
Dickie added: 'The Queen signs every Christmas card she sends, as does Prince Philip.
'There's no stencilling or faxing or anything like that, and the card count runs into hundreds.
'All the staff get a card, then friends get a card.
'There are people you've got send cards to and people you want to send cards to, but every card is signed by both of them.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s all in front of us to see how caring and loving Venkatesh has been towards his nephew Naga Chaitanya and how he wants this movie to be a special one for not only him but give Chay the scope to be a better actor.
In an interview, Bobby revealed how Venkatesh was fully concerned when he heard the narration of the story for the first time. “Why did you tell less about Chaitanya?” he asked Bobby. The script was still in the development stage, then.
The senior star wanted more for his nephew and asked the same, to give something that gives memorable moments for Chaitanya and the audiences. According to Bobby, there were scenes where Chay has to perform while seniors like Venkatesh and Prakash Raj have to lie low.
Venkatesh was very supportive when such scenes were shot, and he was constantly discussing with Chay and encouraging his nephew.
Recently, Chay watched the full movie and was so impressed with it that he hugged his director and thanked him for making such a good film. Well, audiences are also awaiting to see the real-life uncle-nephew combo to create magic on the screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lori Harvey Knows Better Than Her Mom, Marjorie Harvey, According To This Video; And Future, Diddy, And Trey Songz Are Happy About That</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An old video clip showing Lori Harvey, the daughter of Marjorie and Steve Harvey, talking to her mother, regained popularity after some events in her wild love life took place over this year.
In the clip, dating from 2015, when Lori was just an 18-year-old college student, she had a discussion with Marjorie about how to behave appropriately once she was on her own and not living with her parents anymore.
Marjorie started her motherly pieces of advice by bringing up the topic of dating.
The concerned parent asked her daughter jokingly how they were going to handle the fact that she started dating earlier and continued by stating that she was not allowed to be involved with athletes, rappers, and men with similar professions.
It seems that even at such a young age, Lori had a clear opinion of how she was handling her romances as she commented that her mother had nothing to worry about when it comes to dating because she was sure she would make the right choices.
In the footage, Marjorie also gave her daughter the advice to never try to fit in, when God has created her to stand out and urged her to always behave like a lady.
Marjorie said: “I know you just started dating this year, so how are we going to handle that? No athletes, no rappers, we gon go down the list.”
She added: “Don’t ever try to fit in when God has clearly created you to stand out. Always be a lady, and always understand you are the prize. Don’t give yourself to anybody that is not going to be your husband. If they love you, if they really care about you, they’ll wait on it.”
Lori responded by: “When it comes to dating, my mom has nothing to worry about. I got this.”
However, it appears that the rule of dating no rappers does mot hold anymore since Lori has been rumored to be involved with a couple of rap performers in the past year.
Besides allegedly dating Sean “Diddy” Combs, Lori was also said to have been seeing Trey Songz and Future.
The young social media personality is one of the most sought-after dates in the entertainment industry.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vijay-Shankar Movie On Cards? Director Opens Up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of both Vijay and Shankar are eager to see them team up yet again for a film and of late, rumours have been doing the rounds regarding such a possible project. Now, according to reports, director Shankar himself has come up with a statement, which has further strengthened the belief that a film from Vijay-Shankar combo is definitely on cards.
It was during a recent award function that director Shankar opened up about the film with Vijay. When quizzed about such a project, the ace filmmaker mentioned that he and actor Vijay are ready for such a movie and the project might happen anytime soon.
Well, this response of the maverick filmmaker has left everyone quite excited. Earlier, Shankar and Vijay had teamed up for Nanban, the Tamil remake of the superhit Bollywood movie 3 Idiots, which had hit theatres in 2012. The movie turned out to be a huge success at the box office.
Meanwhile, Shankar is busy with the works of his next mega venture Indian 2, featuring Kamal Haasan in the lead role.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Star Trek' actor Rene Auberjonois dead at age 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles - Actor Rene Auberjonois, known for his television roles on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and the US sitcom "Benson," died Sunday in Los Angeles after a battle with cancer. He was 79.
"We are heartbroken to confirm that Rene passed away today," a statement on the actor's website said.
In his official biography, the cause given was metastatic lung cancer.
Auberjonois earned legions of fans for his role as Odo, the shape-shifting head of security on "Star Trek Deep Space Nine," one of the many spinoff series spawned by the legendary science fiction show.
He became a fan favorite at 'Star Trek' conventions for years, donating the proceeds from autographed items to charities, such as Doctors Without Borders.
"I have had my share of successes and my share of flops. But nothing has ever been like this. 'Deep Space Nine' is completely beyond anything that I have ever experienced," the actor once said.
But he also was known for his portrayal in the 1980s of Clayton Endicott III, the chief of staff to a governor on the long-running sitcom "Benson."
Other career highlights include his appearance in Robert Altman's 1970 film "MASH" as Father Mulcahy; a role on the quirky TV drama "Boston Legal"; and a host of voice roles in animated fare, including his performance as Chef Louis in Disney's "The Little Mermaid."
Auberjonois, the son of a writer, grew up in Paris and New York, where his family lived in an artists' colony.
After university, he broke into showbiz on the stage, and earned a Tony award for his first Broadway musical, "Coco" -- about the life of French fashion designer Coco Chanel -- opposite Katharine Hepburn in the title role.
'Star Trek' star William Shatner -- who worked with Auberjonois on "Boston Legal" -- led tributes on Twitter, remembering his "wonderful friendship" with the actor, and fellow series regular George Takei called it a "terrible loss."
"When I look out to the stars, I shall think of you, friend," Takei wrote.
Auberjonois is survived by his wife Judith and two children, Tessa and Remy-Luc.

Oatman mules look harmless enough but this old Arizona mining town on America's Route 66 is a rich seam of unlikely attractions for anyone on an epic road trip.
I've just arrived at Fast Fanny's store in Main Street where they offer everything from T-shirts to shotguns. It's the latest bizarre halt on my journey to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Easy Rider - one of Hollywood's most iconic road movies.
Oatman is a living ghost town that now thrives as an 'authentic Western experience'. It's also a Mecca for bikers. Easy Rider was a cult classic that turned lead actors Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper into the coolest superstars on the planet back in 1969 - their hippy-esque, free-wheeling film a box office sensation.
And inside Oatman's ramshackle motorcycle museum I've stumbled across a replica of Captain America - the film's famous chopper bike that came to represent the counter culture of Sixties America. It may be old but the chrome fittings still give off a rebellious sparkle.
Characters Wyatt and Billy rode their Harley-Davidsons almost 2,000 miles from Los Angeles to New Orleans in the movie. Their stash of money from an ill-fated drugs deal hidden in a fuel tank.
I've saddled up with photographer Richard Bradbury on two hired Harleys. Our week-long ride has been mapped out to follow some of the locations featured in the early part of the film.
Wyatt and Billy slept rough on their journey and got into all manner of scrapes. I'm looking for adventure but prefer more traditional accommodation - if only to ease the back pain of several days' hard riding.
Our trip started a week earlier, planning a route in the famous Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel. The upmarket restaurant is a favourite with the glitterati of Hollywood, and once a hide out for Hopper and Fonda, too. Our bikes have already been delivered to the nearby Waldorf Astoria usual form of hotel, where the transport is a limo.
The start point is Manhattan Beach, where leather-skinned locals vie for the best sunbathing.
It would be tempting to stay and soak up the Pacific breeze, but like Billy and Wyatt, we're on a journey. Soon our bikes are zooming north on Highway 14, past Palmdale and Lancaster to Mojave, near the gateway of Death Valley National Park.
The Oasis at Death Valley was once a tourist destination for wealthy Californians who wanted to experience the uniqueness of desert the desert, where temperatures have reached a record 56.7c.
The extreme climate means most travellers visit only in the winter. Death Valley was the location for many of the iconic scenes in Easy Rider, too. And with Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild soundtrack blasting through my helmet headphones, Bradbury and I are living the dream.
Cruising south again past 20 Mule Canyon and skirting the Nevada border, we stumble across the Amargosa Hotel. Back in the Sixties, the late Marta Becket created a fully operational opera house here, miles from anywhere. Lacking an audience, she hand-painted characters on the walls and often danced to an empty auditorium.
Three hours later we arrive at Café 247, where the T-shirt logo reads 'In The Middle of Nowhere'.
The classic roadside diner features walls smothered in oily automobilia from the golden age of American muscle cars. Outside, another replica of Captain America is fixed to the roof.
Further south again is upmarket Palm Springs, a playground for LA's rich and famous. Bradbury and I collapse on our beds at boutique hotel Villa Royale, with our fly-splattered bikes resting in the parking lot. There's a heated pool and a glitzy bar.
The next day we head east, past Joshua Tree National Park, the inspiration for U2's seminal album. Then it's north again to Needles, passing ghost towns such as Oatman that were left to crumble in the Dust Bowl of the Great Depression. Big skies and huge scenery just add to the drama.
Our final destination is the Pony Soldier Inn at Flagstaff - 200 miles further east on busy Interstate 40. Buffeted by lorries and trucks, we arrive at Wupatki National Monument and visit the Indian ruins where Billy and Wyatt famously camped for the night.
We've travelled more than 1,000 miles and met some interesting characters. Easy Rider may be 50 years old and less cool for the younger generation, but there's still time to get your motor runnin' and head out on the highway ...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cyn Santana Is Forced To Explain Why She Said Black Men Prefer Latinas Over Black Women</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyn Santana had some serious explaining and apologizing to do after making some rather bizarre comments about Black men preferring Latinas over Black women.
The controversy took place in 2016 when Joe Budden’s ex-fiancée sat down on Angela Yee’s Lip Service podcast, and she decided to share her thoughts on interracial dating.
The Love and Hip Hop: New York talent started off by talking about her own experiences with black men by saying this: “I just like Black guys and Spanish girls. Y’all can keep the Puerto Rican men, I’m good. I do Black guys all day, sorry. I did the Spanish thing… doesn’t work out for me. I think they’re too emotional.”
However, she went on to make the following shocking comments about the matter: “Black guys cater to us Spanish girls, especially. Like, they… you know what, let me not get into it. Black girls gonna take it personally. They gonna be like, ‘Uhh uhh!’ Anyway, I’m done with the papis.”
Needless to say, she was bashed by members of the Black community who slammed the curvy model, pushing her to issue an apology.
While on The Real, Cyn decided to clarify her controversial comments by saying: “I think what happened was, we were talking about our experiences with men and different men, races, and ethnicities and comparing our experiences. I think what happened was I poorly articulated myself and I irresponsibly repeated something that I heard my entire life.”
She added: “This is a tough moment for me. I feel like I poorly articulated myself, and I irresponsibly repeated something that I heard throughout my teenage years, which was the whole, ‘Oh, Black men love Spanish women or Latinas, you know.’ And I think people took that message wrongly. That’s not what I meant.”
The new explanation did not sit well with many, and Cyn issued a statement on social media to try to get out of the messy situation: “I especially love THE BLACK WOMAN. I’ve never in my life bashed one. Never will. So yeah, Ima explains myself and shed some clarity on a clip that’s being spread around with little context. I’ve used the N-word ignorantly most of my life, not knowing that it was actually a bad word, and it was offensive. Took that word out of my vocab… If I’ve offended anyone, I do indeed apologize.”
What are your thoughts on this drama?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nell Gifford who co-founded Giffords Circus dies from breast cancer aged 46 - leaving behind nine-year-old twins</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Circus creator Nell Gifford has passed away at the age of 46 following a longstanding battle with breast cancer.   
Nell, who was originally from Wiltshire was surrounded by family 'both immediate and circus' when she died on Sunday December 8th.  
The mother of nine-year-old twins Cecil and Red was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, after finding a lump in her breast. 
Earlier this year was told she had just one year left to live as the disease had spread to her bones and lymph nodes.
In a statement, Gifford Circus said: 'We know many tears will be falling as Nell touched so many hearts. 
'Her vision for Giffords Circus was to bring happiness, imagination and enliven people’s souls. Giffords Circus shall continue to do just that. 
'Whilst the world is a dimmer place today, Nell will continue to live through the Circus.
'Nell was a creative genius, a daughter, step-daughter, sister, friend, leader and mother. 
'She leaves behind the next generation – her twins Cecil and Red – who are both part of the Giffords Circus DNA. We love her. May she rest in peace.'  
In 2020 Giffords Circus will celebrate their 20th anniversary of the Circus and say that Nell wanted it to be the 'showstopper'.   
Next year’s production, 'The Hooley' will celebrate the first 20 years, the next 20 years of the circus as well as Nell’s incredible life. 
The circus continued: 'Nell built a circus to last. It is poised to grow and fulfill Nell’s plans for the future.' 
The mother was transparent about her breast cancer battle, and earlier this year revealed she was honest about her cancer diagnosis with her children.
She previously told the Evening Standard: 'I hate secrets, they are corrosive. The more people are open about cancer the less scary it is.'
Nell was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, after finding a lump in her breast. She underwent three rounds of chemotherapy - losing her hair each time. 
Talking about her twins, who also star in her circus, she said: 'It's a lot for the children to take on. But if they didn't know they wouldn't be processing it, and they will have to sometime. We are doing it together.' 
Nell created Gifford Circus, which tours the south of England every summer, with her ex-husband Toti Gifford in 2000.
Her son Cecil and daughter Red, who go to school in Stroud, Gloucestershire, will presumably be left in the care of her former husband Toti.
The mother-of-two joined at New York State circus at 18 after her mother had an accident falling off a horse. 
Revealing to the Daily Mail previously, she wrote: 'I spent a month travelling New York State, painting the lorries and riding a horse in the parade.
'I saw a happy place where children and animals played together in the sunshine, and the workplace was a huge, candy-striped tent, full of music. It reminded me so much of my younger years.'
Three years later, after graduating from Oxford, she bought an old van and joined the first show that came to town. And for the next few years she worked for many different circuses.   
Writing for the Daily Mail about starting her own circus she said: 'Returning home in 1999, I wanted to breathe new life into the art of circus in Britain, and I shared my dream with a tall, curly-haired boy named Toti Gifford, a landscape gardener whom I’d met on a friend’s farm in Cheltenham between tours.
'We married that year and immediately started our own circus. 
'We had no equipment or backing - but we did have a deadline, after I persuaded the organisers of the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival that their line-up for May 2000 should include a booking for Gifford’s Circus, as we had decided it should be called.'

Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv Sinha too wished him with a throwback picture and wrote, "Happybirthday to my #Hero #Family #Happy #Memories #Star #Legend #Shotgun #Idol #Shatrughansinha #Best #Father #fatherandson #Throwback #Monday #toomanyhastags."
Speaking about her bond with her father, Sonakshi said in an old Rediff interview, "I have always been the apple of my father's eye. I am the most pampered person at home since I am the youngest. Also, because I am a girl. He is the best father that I could have asked for."
In yet another interview, when asked if she discusses work with him, the actress had said, '"I discuss some of my films with him, as and when we get the time. He doesn't really interfere in what roles or movies I choose. He watches my films as a father and is my biggest fan."
Last year, Sonakshi and Shatrughan Sinha shared a frame in Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se song 'Rafta Rafta'.
Talking about films, Sonakshi will next be seen in Salman Khan's 'Dabangg 3'. Explaining why 'Dabangg' is a special franchise for her, the actress told IANS, "Every time I enter the set of Dabangg, it is a special feeling. I started my journey 10 years ago with that film. It was my debut film opposite Salman Khan. My equation will never change with him no matter how many films I sign and what I achieve as an actress. He helped me to find my calling; I did not even know that I can act and I am an actress now."
Besides this movie, Sonakshi is also a part of Ajay Devgn's 'Bhuj: The Pride Of India' alongside Parineeti Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Rana Daggubati and Ammy Virk.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kartik Aaryan is in a happy place as both his work and love life are in the headlines! In his recent tête-à-tête with Times Now, when Kartik was quizzed if he has been attracted to someone else while being in a relationship, the actor gave a rather startling reply and said, "Yes."
He said, "Yes, I have! Emotional cheating should never be the case. Physical cheating too shouldn't be the case. But emotional is worse. So in attraction, it isn't cheating because you feel she's cute then it's okay. It's better if it doesn't go beyond that."
Kartik's co-star Ananya Panday also nodded along with his reply and said that one can find someone else cute and that's not 'cheating'.
Meanwhile, both Kartik and Ananya have been getting rave reviews for their latest release - Pati Patni Aur Woh, which also casts Bhumi Pednekar in the lead role. From film critics to moviegoers, everyone is impressed with their work in the film and Kartik is all set to bag one more hit in his kitty.
Kartik will next be seen in Imtiaz Ali's upcoming directorial, tentatively called 'Aaj Kal'. The film also casts Kartik's rumoured girlfriend, Sara Ali Khan and is all set to hit the theatres on February 14, 2020.
Ananya, on the other hand, will next be seen in Khaali Peeli, which marks her third outing after Student of the Year 2 and Pati Patni Aur Woh. She is paired opposite Ishaan Khatter in the film and fans are quite excited to see them together on the silver screen.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Andrew Scott made priests hot during his sensual role as a cleric in hit-TV show Fleabag earlier this year.
And now a real-life vicar has amassed more than 100,000 Instagram followers - apparently due to his good looks.
Rev Christopher Lee, 36, from west London, posts '60-second sermons' to his 116,500 fans.

The married father of two daughters is adamant they follow him for the power of the gospels and not due to his appearance.
Yet barrels of female followers post comments such as 'I love you' and 'you just keep blowing my mind' as well as putting numerous love heart emojis under his pictures.
He told the Times: 'It's never a horrible thing to be told you're good-looking, but I think most people follow me because of my content, because I speak to them on a deeper level.'
Rev Lee, who has been vicar at St Saviour's Church for four years, added: 'We get people every week saying they found us on Instagram.'
But he finds the comparisons to Scott's character embarrassing and thinks it is just due to his age.
He told iNews last month: 'Priests traditionally are a little bit heavy, a little bit old and a little bit distant, and I am, I think, none of those things.'
Scott's character was introduced in the second series of the show after he was brought in to officiate Fleabag's father and his second wife's wedding - and sparks immediately flew between the two of them.
The sequel series ended with Fleabag and the Priest going their separate ways during a tearful goodbye at a bus stop.
When Rev Lee was 21, he was working in business and had a house and a mortgage.
But he decided to teach English in Tanzania and armed himself with a Bible as his main tool.
After becoming engaged by his reading about God, he did a distance-learning degree to make him a priest.
Aged 24 he was ordained a deacon in the diocese of Mount Kilimanjaro.
The Church of England is trying to bolster its presence online and will today launch an app for Google Home smart speaker.
The app will allow users to ask the device to say grace before meals as well as pray before bed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Ghost ship' of Sutton Hoo to sail again: Anglo-Saxon vessel found in Suffolk 80 years ago will be rebuilt from 3D computer models to explore the origins of English seafaring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Anglo-Saxon vessel found in the Sutton Hoo burial mound in Suffolk 80 years ago will sail again as experts look to rebuild the ship from digital 3D models.
Dated back to the early 7th century, the 90 foot (27 metre) -long vessel is oft dubbed a 'ghost ship' thanks to its manner of preservation.
In the mound — thought the resting place of King Rædwald — only the impression of the ship and its iron rivets remained, the timber having long rotted away.
Nevertheless, a team of archaeologists and shipbuilders have succeeded in creating a three-dimensional digital mock-up of the vessel to allow it to be reconstructed.
Expert hope that recreating a full-size, fully-operational version of the ship will help shine light on how the Anglo-Saxons began England's tradition of seafaring. 
The vessel is hoped to take its first voyage across the seas in 2022.
Located near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Sutton Hoo is home to two burial mounds from the 6th and 7th centuries — the latter a ship burial.
The undisturbed burial site is believed to have been the resting place of King Rædwald of East Anglia.
The vessel is oft dubbed a a 'ghost ship' thanks to how only its iron rivets and impressions of timber remained.
Within the ship, however, archaeologists in 1939 found a ceremonial helmet, a shield, a sword, pieces of silver plate from the Byzantine Empire and metalwork fittings made of gold and gems. 
The Sutton Hoo artefacts are now housed in the collections of the British Museum, London, while the mound site is in the care of the National Trust.
'We suspect that seafaring was rooted in the hearts of the Angles and Saxons that made England their home. But we know little about it,' Sutton Hoo Ship's Company director Martin Carver told the Times.
'We want to see what a ship and its crew could do. Some things can be learnt from a book or a test tube; other things need learning by doing.'
'Our objectives are to learn how an early English ship was built, its performance in river, lake and sea, its handling of the wind and tides — and not only to learn what’s possible and record it, but to discover what it feels like.'
'So our project will contribute to knowledge of our shores and seas and knowledge of the earliest English, their history, way of life, their poetry.'
Work on the vessel will begin in earnest next month when volunteers will complete the frame onto which the ship's keel will be constructed.
Historical experts are working to ensure that the craft is constructed using authentic Anglo-Saxon building techniques and appropriate building materials for the time. 
This will include the joining of oak planks in the overlapping — or 'clinker' — style.
It is expected that the complete build will cost around £1 million ($1.3 million).
The shipbuilders believe that the replica could be completed and ready to brave the seas as soon as 2022, with potential test sailings across the North Sea and beyond. 
Experts believe that the original ship may also have sailed the seas — and been used for trading and warfare — before being hauled overland to play its role in the burial. 
Within the ship, archaeologists found various treasures from across both the British Isles as well as the Byzantine (eastern Roman) and Frankish (western European) empires — including the famed Sutton Hoo helmet. 
The grave itself is thought to belong to King Rædwald of East Anglia, a member of the Wuffingas dynasty which has been associated with the Wulfing clan of Sweden, who appeared in the Old English epic poem Beowulf.
Archaeologists believe that ship burials were likely intended to take the departed on their voyage into the afterlife. 
King Rædwald is notable for posthumously engaging in this practice and other pagan traditions despite having received the Christian sacraments.
'On his return home, he was seduced by his wife and certain perverse teachers, and turned aside from the sincerity of the faith,' wrote  historian and monk Saint Bede the Venerable in around the year 731.
'Like the Samaritans of old, he seemed at the same time to serve Christ and the gods whom he served before; and in the same temple he had an altar for the Christian Sacrifice, and another small one at which to offer victims to devils.'
King Rædwald was an Anglo-Saxon monarch who ruled the kingdom of East Anglia — what is today the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.
His reign is believed to have lasted from 599–624 AD, at which point he was placed in a ship burial at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk.
Rædwald was the first king of the East Angles to convert to Christianity, although he continued to practice pagan rites — reportedly maintaining a pagan alter alongside his Christian one — until his death.
He was a member of the Wuffingas dynasty which has been associated with the Wulfing clan of Sweden, who appeared in the Old English epic poem Beowulf. 
The ship was unearthed from its burial mound near Woodbridge in 1939 by a team of archaeologists led by one Basil Brown.
It is from the rivets and impressions of timber beams that had long-rotted-away that researchers from Southampton University have managed to digitally model the ship.
'Although that doesn’t sound like much evidence, it is enough to give us a virtually complete hull shape from keel to gunwale [the top edge of the hull on either side],' Southampton's maritime archaeologist Julian Whitewright told the Times.
This, he added, 'comprises the runs of the planking, the internal frame locations and general dimensions, the curvature of the keel and ends of the ship.'
'This is far more than most archaeological reconstructions have.'
For those interested in getting involved with the build, the Sutton Hoo Ship's Company is seeking green-oak timber woodworkers — ideally with traditional boat-building experience — along with data cataloguers and project photographers.
In addition, members of the public can, for £20 (around $26) sponsor one of the 3,598 iron rivets needed to construct the vessel's hull. 
Each sponsor will receive a commemorative pin badge and ownership card — with a unique number that will help them locate their rivet in the finished vessel.
