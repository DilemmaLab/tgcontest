    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia Banned From Olympics and Global Sports for 4 Years Over Doping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Global antidoping leaders agreed unanimously on Monday to banish Russia from international sports — including next summer’s Olympic Games in Tokyo — for four years, the latest and severest punishment yet connected to a yearslong cheating scheme that has tarnished global sport.
The World Anti-Doping Agency’s punishment means that Russia’s flag, name and anthem will not be allowed at the Tokyo Games, though the practical competitive effects may be minimal: Russian athletes not implicated in doping could compete in the Olympics and other world championships, but only under a neutral flag. The agency also barred Russian sports and government officials from the Games and prohibited the country from hosting international events.
The move, which comes four years after the first details of the scheme that peaked at the 2014 Sochi Olympics were made public, was hailed by WADA as a tough step, though some antidoping leaders questioned that.
“For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,” WADA president Craig Reedie said at a news conference. “Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and rejoin the global antidoping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.”
To some, including many athlete groups and national antidoping agencies, the punishment does not go far enough, because it leaves open the possibility that hundreds of Russian athletes can appear in Tokyo, just as they did at the Winter Olympics in South Korea last year.
The decision is unlikely to surprise many given the scale of Russia’s attempt to conceal, obfuscate and frustrate attempts to unmask the beneficiaries of a state-powered doping program, remarkable for its sophistication and scope.
Still, Russia is almost certain to contest the decision. It continues to steadfastly deny many of the allegations, even after several independent investigations that have revealed a welter of evidence against it.
Russian officials have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after the announcement from the antidoping agency, which convened for a special meeting near the International Olympic Committee’s headquarters in Lausanne.
The Russian prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, encouraged an appeal, saying that the antidoping agency’s decision looked to him like a “continuation of anti-Russian hysteria.”
But he offered a concession. “The Russian side, too, — by that I mean our sports community — still has significant problems with doping,” he said. “This is undeniable.”
The WADA board agreed to a suite of punishments detailed in a report from a committee led by the British lawyer Jonathan Taylor that it received late last month. The penalties include forcing Russian athletes who have not been implicated in doping to compete at a second consecutive Olympic Games in neutral uniforms and to collect any medals they win without the raising of the nation’s flag or the playing of its anthem.
They also bar Russian government officials and representatives from attending major events or from serving on the board of any organization that has signed the global antidoping code, prevent Russia from bidding on new championships, and require moving any international events the country was set to host during the four-year period.
Linda Helleland, a Norwegian who is the outgoing vice president of the antidoping agency, expressed frustration at the decision, saying she wanted the punishment to ensure that Russian athletes would not be able to compete independently, as they did in South Korea, during the ban.
But Helleland said that was not an option for what she called “the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen,” because the board was limited to two choices: Agree with the punishments recommended by Taylor’s committee, or reject them.
“I am not happy with the decision we made today,” Helleland told reporters at the conclusion of the hourlong meeting. “This was as far as we could go.”
Travis T. Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said: “To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law. And, in turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.”
If Russia is unable to have the ruling overturned, the country’s ouster from the world of international sport would stretch to events well beyond the Olympics, including soccer’s World Cup.
WADA officials said the practicalities of Russia’s ban still needed to be worked out with individual sports federations. For example, Russia would be allowed to compete in the qualification matches for the 2022 World Cup, though should it progress to the tournament the team would be allowed to participate only as a neutral, without any insignia that would identify the team as being Russian.
What has angered many is Russia’s mendacity in the face of efforts to rehabilitate the country after whistle-blower evidence helped unravel a meticulously planned — and ultimately successful — scheme in which Russian antidoping experts and members of the country’s intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
As part of the resolution of that case, Russia agreed to provide a set of testing results to doping regulators from its Moscow laboratory. It is that database, which Russia was found to have manipulated, that is at the heart of a crisis that threatens its sporting future.
Taylor, who will be stepping down from his role at WADA at the end of the year, told The New York Times that he could understand why some people would think the penalties did not go far enough, but he insisted that the measures meted out in Switzerland on Monday amounted to a humiliation for the Russian authorities.
“Don’t tell me that doesn’t affect them,” he said. “There’s national pride; what happens if this neutral team wins the World Cup and Putin’s not there? Don’t tell me it doesn’t mean anything.”
While the pressure has been ratcheting up on Russia from the outside, inside the country there has been a propaganda campaign that has attempted to discredit the findings as just another Western plot.
One Russian talk show described the revelations as an attempt by Russia’s rivals to eliminate a potential medal-winning opponent, while a documentary tried to lay the blame on the whistle-blower, Grigory Rodchenkov, who helped mastermind the scheme from his position as the head of the Moscow laboratory. The claims mirror those of Russian officials who were proved by WADA investigators to frame Rodchenkov and hide the identity of the true culprits.
Russia’s denials and manipulations of data continued well after WADA had gone public in September with confirmation that thousands of crucial Russian files had been deleted or manipulated, and that the data that was provided did not match a database on Russian athletes that it received in 2017.
In a follow-up meeting in October to help explain the discrepancies, Russia’s sports minister provided WADA with fresh data, which when studied revealed yet more manipulation.
Taylor used an expletive to describe Russia’s efforts to frame Rodchenkov, which involved fabricating messages between the former laboratory director and his staff, to suggest they were plotting to extort Russian athletes by falsely accusing them of failing drugs tests. Details of that scheme and other manipulated evidence were brought to WADA’s attention by the sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov. “I don’t know if he is corrupt or incompetent,” Taylor said of Kolobkov, a former fencer who was appointed to his post after revelations of Russia’s vast doping scheme.
“After all of this, who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost?” Rodchenkov said in a statement. “Russia dug its own grave and has ruined the chances for any clean Russian athlete to compete. If the files were deleted, how can any athlete credibly prove its innocence?”
A rare voice of dissent in Russia has come from the current head of its antidoping agency, Yuri Ganus. For months, as the crisis has grown, Ganus has spoken out against his country’s handling of the scheme, telling the world that he believed thousands of athlete files had likely been deleted to save the reputations of some of Russia’s most significant figures.
He told The New York Times that the punishment was logical, but he would back an appeal he went on to describe a “mission impossible” to prevent a generation of clean athletes from being punished for a scheme they had no part in. Ganus called on Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to personally become involved. “I think there is only one person who can change the situation,” Ganus said.
Margarita Pakhnotskaya, the deputy head of Russia’s antidoping agency, said that the ban should prompt action by officials in her country who have suggested that Russia was being unfairly targeted.
“This is another reason for sports executives to think about whether we are moving in the right direction,” the Interfax news agency quoted her as saying. “I’m hearing presidents of federations and experts proudly trumpet their activities — ‘We have given all the answers, we’re surrounded only by enemies who are attacking our athletes.’ This all shows that there has been no change in our antidoping culture.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia banned from 2022 FIFA World Cup and 2020 Olympics following doping decision</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia are set to miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulating laboratory data after the doping scandal that has rocked sport.
Their executive committee concluded Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify cheats.
The WADA board convened for a special meeting on Monday close to the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and ruled unanimously in favour of the global ban.
It is the most severe punishment yet connected to the cheating scheme, which peaked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
However, the football team is set to be clear to compete in Euro 2020 - with Saint Petersburg a host city - as the competition is organised by UEFA, who are not defined as a "major event organisation" with regards to anti-doping breaches.
The punishments come four years after details of the doping scheme were made public, with specific bans on Russian sports and government officials which prohibits the country from hosting international events.
Russia could still contest the decision and look set to do so as it continues to deny many allegations despite several independent investigations finding wrongdoing.
Officials from the country have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but if unsuccessful then they face missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the Olympics in Tokyo 2020.
Many athletes have been sidelined from the past two Olympic games and the country was stripped of its flag at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as punishment for its Sochi cover-ups.
The latest sanctions were recommended by WADA's compliance review committee and effectively strip Russia's anti-doping agency, RUSADA, of its accreditation.
Last month, Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory date to technical issues.
The punishment does not put a blanket ban on clean Russian athletes, leaving them said to be clear to compete without their flag or anthem as they did in Pyeongchang.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA imposes four-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency has imposed a four-year ban on Russia using its flag, anthem and team names at Olympic and other major sports events.
The ban means Russia will be unable to formally compete in next summer's Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.
Other major events that fall during the four-year period include world championships and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
WADA's executive committee voted in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday and concluded that officials in a Moscow anti-doping laboratory had tampered with data.
The tampering -- before and while the data was being forensically copied by WADA -- included planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. System messages were also fabricated in an effort to hamper the work of WADA investigators.
The executive committee's decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, an agency spokesperson said. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem, as was the case during the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
When asked for clarification on Russia's participation in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup and the tournament itself, a FIFA spokesperson told ESPN: "FIFA has taken note of the decision taken by WADA's Executive Committee today. FIFA is in contact with WADA and the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football."
ESPN also reached out to the International Olympic Committee, which responded that it supports WADA's decision.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency has 21 days to appeal the sanctions, and if it does so, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, WADA has said.
"The position of Russia's Olympic Committee remains unchanged -- sanctions are inadequate, illogical and excessive," Russia's Olympic Committee President Stanislav Pozdnyakov said in response to the sanctions.
"Of course, we are disappointed, but we initially assumed that the recommendations of the WADA Executive Committee would be approved without change, especially after the main points were made public."
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals, notably since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes banned from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but was reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
Sports minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the lab data to technical issues and on Monday told reporters that "everything possible was done to resolve this situation."
The consequences of WADA's ruling dictate that no Russian government representatives may participate in or attend any Olympic or other sports event put on by a major event organisation over the four-year period. As such, Russian president Vladimir Putin will not be able to attend the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, nor the 2022 World Cup -- should the ban affect that tournament.
Additionally, Russia may not host any major event in the four-year period, and where the right to host such an event has already been awarded to Russia, that right must be withdrawn and re-assigned to another country as far as is legally or practically possible.
The 2020 European Championship football tournament, in which Russia's Saint Petersburg Stadium is set to host several games, is not considered a major event by WADA, therefore Russian participation and hosting will not be affected.
As part of Monday's ruling, Russia also is not permitted to bid for the right to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, irrespective of whether the bidding takes place during or after the four-year period.
Some Russian officials have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
But WADA president Craig Reedie said: "The ExCo's strong decision today shows WADA's determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA's reinstatement conditions ... demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered today.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA bans Russia from Olympics over doping scandals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia will be barred from competing in next year’s Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned the powerhouse from global sports for four years as punishment for tampering with a Moscow lab database.
WADA’s executive committee decided during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, that Russia be suspended after the agency accused Moscow of falsifying doping data handed over to investigators earlier this year, according to Agence France-Presse.
Not only will the country have no formal presence in the next Olympic cycle, but government officials will be barred from attending any major events, while Russia will lose the right to host, or even bid for, tournaments.
“WADA’s executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years,” WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said.
Under the sanctions, Russian athletes will still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what WADA believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
“They are going to have to prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation,” Fitzgerald said.
The committee made the decision after concluding that Moscow had tampered with lab data by planting fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats, WADA investigators and the International Olympic Committee said last month.
“Flagrant manipulation” of the Moscow lab data was “an insult to the sporting movement worldwide,” the IOC said last month.
It remained unclear how the ruling will affect Russian teams taking part in world championships such as soccer’s World Cup in 2022.
Russia’s anti-doping agency RUSADA can appeal WADA’s decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of RUSADA — which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year — had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the lab data. The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.
RUSADA head Yuri Ganus could not be immediately reached for comment. His deputy, Margarita Pakhnotskaya, told the TASS news agency that WADA’s decision had been expected, according to Reuters.
Last month, Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov attributed the discrepancies in the lab data to technical issues.
“I’m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,” said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian lawmaker who serves on the WADA executive committee and has long urged a tougher line against Russia.
“This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologize on all the pain all the athletes and sports fans have experienced,” Helleland added.
The perennial global sports power has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Many Russian athletes were sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country was stripped of its flag altogether at last year’s PyeongChang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
In PyeongChang, 168 Russians who had not been implicated in the country’s state-sponsored doping scheme competed as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”
Former WADA president Dick Pound, who chaired the commission that in 2015 alleged mass doping in Russian athletics, said Moscow had gone “too far” this time.
“The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer,” Pound told AFP.
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia — which hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the World Cup in 2018 — “on many levels” in the sporting world.
“On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it’s among the sporting giants, so that’s influential,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian athletes banned for 4 years on doping charges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia was banned from the world's top sporting events for four years on Monday, including the next summer and winter Olympics and the 2022 soccer World Cup, for tampering with doping tests.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee acted after concluding that Moscow had planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests in laboratory data that could have helped identify drug cheats.
The decision was a huge blow to the pride of a nation that has traditionally been a powerhouse in many sports but whose reputation has been tarnished by a series of doping scandals.
“For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,” WADA President Craig Reedie said after a meeting of WADA's executive committee in the Swiss city of Lausanne.
He said in a statement Russia's actions had demanded a robust response and added: “That is exactly what has been delivered today.”
WADA confirmed the Russian national team could not take part in the 2022 World Cup soccer in Qatar under the Russian flag and could participate only as neutrals.
It was not clear how competing as neutrals at the World Cup might work in practice. FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said it was in contact with WADA to clarify the extent of the decision.
The ban also means Russian sportsmen and sportswomen will not be able to perform at the Olympics in Tokyo next year under their own flag and national anthem.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has come under attack for not taking a harder line on Russian doping, said it fully backed the ruling by the Swiss-based WADA. The 2020 Tokyo Olympic organising committee said it would welcome all athletes as long as they were clean and work with other organisations to fully implement anti-doping measures, Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya said.
Russia has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Many of Russia's athletes were sidelined from the past two Olympics and Russia was stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions, which also include a four-year ban on Russia hosting major sporting events, were recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, suspended in 2015 but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
The sanctions in effect strip the agency of its accreditation.
The punishment leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at big international events without their flag or anthem for the next four years, something they did at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials have tried to cast WADA's behaviour as part of what they say is a broader Western attempt to hold back Moscow.
Igor Lebedev, a lawmaker and deputy speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, said the move was a serious blow to Russian sport that required a tough response from Russian authorities, the RIA news agency reported.
If RUSADA appeals WADA's punishment, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Some sport officials wanted tougher action. Travis Tygart, head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), said the failure to impose a complete ban was “yet another devastating blow to clean athletes.”
Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow's suspended anti-doping laboratory, said that without the complete data from the Moscow laboratory there was no telling how many athletes were still competing doped.
“Russia's falsifications and cheating continued in 2019 even when Russia was under scrutiny,” Rodchenkov, now in hiding in the United States, said in a statement.
Noting that many files had been deleted and results lost, he said: “Who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA imposes four-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency has imposed a four-year ban on Russia using its flag, anthem and team names at Olympic and other major sports events.
The ban means Russia will be unable to formally compete in next summer's Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.
Other major events that fall during the four-year period include world championships and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
WADA's executive committee voted in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday and concluded that officials in a Moscow anti-doping laboratory had tampered with data.
The tampering -- before and while the data was being forensically copied by WADA -- included planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. System messages were also fabricated in an effort to hamper the work of WADA investigators.
The executive committee's decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, an agency spokesperson said. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem, as was the case during the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
When asked for clarification on Russia's participation in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup and the tournament itself, a FIFA spokesperson told ESPN: "FIFA has taken note of the decision taken by WADA's Executive Committee today. FIFA is in contact with WADA and the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football."
ESPN also reached out to the International Olympic Committee, which responded that it supports WADA's decision.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency has 21 days to appeal the sanctions, and if it does so, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, WADA has said.
"The position of Russia's Olympic Committee remains unchanged -- sanctions are inadequate, illogical and excessive," Russia's Olympic Committee President Stanislav Pozdnyakov said in response to the sanctions.
"Of course, we are disappointed, but we initially assumed that the recommendations of the WADA Executive Committee would be approved without change, especially after the main points were made public."
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals, notably since a 2015 report commissioned by WADA found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes banned from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but was reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
Sports minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the lab data to technical issues and on Monday told reporters that "everything possible was done to resolve this situation."
The consequences of WADA's ruling dictate that no Russian government representatives may participate in or attend any Olympic or other sports event put on by a major event organisation over the four-year period. As such, Russian president Vladimir Putin will not be able to attend the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, nor the 2022 World Cup -- should the ban affect that tournament.
Additionally, Russia may not host any major event in the four-year period, and where the right to host such an event has already been awarded to Russia, that right must be withdrawn and re-assigned to another country as far as is legally or practically possible.
The 2020 European Championship football tournament, in which Russia's Saint Petersburg Stadium is set to host several games, is not considered a major event by WADA, therefore Russian participation and hosting will not be affected.
As part of Monday's ruling, Russia also is not permitted to bid for the right to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, irrespective of whether the bidding takes place during or after the four-year period.
Some Russian officials have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
But WADA president Craig Reedie said: "The ExCo's strong decision today shows WADA's determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA's reinstatement conditions ... demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered today.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wada bans Russia from international competitions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE
Russia will miss next year's Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned the powerhouse from global sporting events for four years over manipulated doping data.
Wada's executive committee, meeting in Lausanne, decided that Russia be handed the four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory doping data handed over to investigators earlier this year.
Not only will Russia be ruled out of the next Olympic cycle, but Russian government officials will be barred from attending any major events, while the country will lose the right to host, or even bid, for tournaments.
"Wada's executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years," Wada spokesman James Fitzgerald said.
Under the sanctions, Russian sportsmen and women will still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what Wada believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
"They are going to have prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation," Fitzgerald said.
The independent report by Richard McLaren, released in 2016, revealed the significant extent of state-sponsored doping in Russia, notably between 2011 and 2015.
It led to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) being suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations of a vast state-supported doping programme.
REINSTATEMENT
Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's controversial reinstatement by Wada in September 2018.
The Wada decision was widely predicted, with the body's president, Craig Reedie, having made a presentation Saturday to the Olympic Summit, participants of which "strongly condemned those responsible for the manipulation of the data from the Moscow laboratory".
"It was agreed that this was an attack on sport and that these actions should lead to the toughest sanctions against those responsible," the IOC said in a statement.
"It was stressed by the participants that full justice must be finally done so that the guilty ones can be properly punished and the innocent ones are fully protected."
The IOC (International Olympic Committee) asked that the Russian authorities deliver the "fully authenticated raw data".
Former Wada president Dick Pound, who chaired the commission that in 2015 made damning accusations of mass doping in Russian athletics, said Moscow had this time gone "too far".
"The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer," Pound told AFP.
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia -- which in recent years hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the football World Cup in 2018 -- "on many levels" in the sporting world.
"On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it's among the sporting giants, so that's influential," he said.
"It's (also) influential because Russia hosts and is willing to host many competitions for international federations, especially those who don't have much money of their own, so they have a considerable influence among the international federations.
"And they've been quite strategic about making sure that they get Russians into positions on international federations. So they have an impact from inside as well as from outside."
A majority of Wada's influential athlete committee had called overnight for a "complete ban on Russian participation", nine members of the 17-strong group saying such a move was "the only meaningful sanction".
"We maintain that the fraud, manipulation and deception revealed to date will only be encouraged and perpetuated with a lesser response," they said.
"To date, the Russian doping saga has dominated three Olympic and Paralympic Games, with a fourth on the horizon. Russia's ongoing and intentional acts of deception, fraud and corruption have made a mockery not only those who play by the rules, but those who create and safeguard them."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia to discover sporting fate as WADA meets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE: Russia faces a four-year ban from international sporting competitions, including the Olympic Games, when the World Anti-Doping Agency hold a crucial meeting in Lausanne.
WADA's executive committee is expected to approve a recommendation by its Compliance Review Committee that Russia be handed a four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory doping data handed over to investigators earlier this year.
Such a heavy sanction would see Russia ruled out of next year's Tokyo Olympics and the Winter Games in Beijing in 2022.
Russian government officials would be barred from attending any major events, while the country would lose the right to host, or even bid, for tournaments.
Under the proposed sanctions, Russian sportsmen and women would still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what WADA believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's controversial reinstatement by WADA in September 2018.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) had been suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations of a vast state-supported doping program.
Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, refused to speculate on the outcome of the WADA meeting, but asked for a "clear" answer for events that might be affected.
"I'm not in a position to speculate," said Bach on Thursday (Dec 5) after a meeting of the IOC's own Executive Board. "I don't know the details of the decision WADA could take.
"I hope that WADA will be clear on the events to which this decision will refer and why it applies or not.
"This is in the hands of WADA and in particular the CRC (Compliance Review Committee)," Bach added, making clear the decision would be binding on the IOC as "a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code".
"ATTACK ON SPORT"
WADA president Craig Reedie made a presentation Saturday to the Olympic Summit, participants of which "strongly condemned those responsible for the manipulation of the data from the Moscow laboratory".
"It was agreed that this was an attack on sport and that these actions should lead to the toughest sanctions against those responsible," the IOC said in a statement.

"The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer," Pound told AFP.
"Much of the stuff we are looking back now is 2011, 2015. We are years later and many of those athletes are no longer competing and there is a new generation of athlete, many of whom have been regularly tested."
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia - which in recent years hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics as well as the football World Cup in 2018 - "on many levels" in the sporting world.
"On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it's among the sporting giants, so that's influential," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anti-doping agency imposes 4-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND -- Russia was slapped Monday with a four-year ban from international sports events, including next summer's Tokyo Olympics, over a longstanding doping scandal, although its athletes will still be able to compete if they can show they are clean competitors.
The ruling by the World Anti-Doping Agency's executive committee means that Russia's flag, name and anthem will not appear at the Tokyo Games, and the country also could be stripped of hosting world championships in Olympic sports.
The sanctions are the harshest punishment yet for Russian state authorities who were accused of tampering with a Moscow laboratory database. Russia's anti-doping agency can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days -- an action it has signalled it would take.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order ... but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial," WADA president Craig Reedie said.
Russian athletes can compete in major events only if they are not implicated in positive doping tests or if their data was not manipulated, according to the WADA ruling.
For soccer's 2022 World Cup, WADA said the Russian team will play under its name in the qualifying program in Europe. If it qualifies to play in Qatar, the team name must be changed to something neutral that likely would not include the word "Russia."
At the past two track and field world championships, Russians competed as "Authorized Neutral Athlete." A softer line was taken ahead of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games, when the International Olympic Committee suspended the Russian Olympic body yet allowed athletes and teams to compete as "Olympic Athlete from Russia."
Going forward, "they cannot use the name of the country in the name of the team," WADA president-elect Witold Banka told The Associated Press.
Legal fallout from the WADA ruling at CAS seems sure to dominate preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which open July 24.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged sports organizations to appeal and said WADA's ruling was "a continuation of this anti-Russian hysteria which has already become chronic."
The latest round of sanctions were imposed because tampering with the Moscow data was a new violation of anti-doping rules committed as recently as January.
Handing over a clean database to WADA was a key requirement given to Russia 15 months ago to help bring closure to a scandal that has tainted the Olympics over the last decade.
WADA investigators and the IOC agreed that evidence showed Russian authorities corrupted data from the Moscow lab that was long sealed by security forces. Hundreds of potential doping cases were deleted and evidence falsely planted to shift the blame onto whistleblowers.
"Flagrant manipulation" of the data was "an insult to the sporting movement worldwide," the IOC said last month.
Athletes whose data was manipulated in the 2012-15 testing period now face disciplinary cases by their sport's governing body.
"Yes, we do know who those athletes are. They will be kept out of the (Tokyo) Games," said British lawyer Jonathan Taylor, chairman of the WADA panel whose proposed sanctions were unanimously approved Monday.
However, the doping watchdog's outgoing vice-president was left frustrated by an unwillingness to fully expel Russia from the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games.
"I'm not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go," said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian lawmaker who has long pushed for a tougher line against Russia. "This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologize on all the pain all the athletes and sports fans have experienced."
Although the IOC has called for the strongest possible sanctions, it wants those sanctions directed at Russian state authorities rather than athletes or Olympic officials.
That position was opposed by most of WADA's athlete commission. It wanted the kind of blanket ban Russia avoided for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games when a state-run doping program was exposed by media and WADA investigations after Russia hosted the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.
The decision to appeal has been stripped from RUSADA chief executive Yuri Ganus, an independent figure criticizing Russian authorities' conduct on the doping data issue. Authority was passed to the agency's supervisory board after an intervention led by the Russian Olympic Committee.
The ROC on Saturday labeled the expected sanctions as "illogical and inappropriate."
Russia has stuck to its claim that deceptive edits in the data were in fact made by WADA's star witness, Grigory Rodchenkov. The former Moscow lab director's flight into the witness protection program in the United States was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary.
"As usual, Russia has disregarded all of its promises and obligations to clean sport," Rodchenkov said Monday in a statement from his lawyers.
Sports fans worldwide will still be watching top-tier events from Russia in the next four years despite the hosting ban.
In soccer, St. Petersburg will still host four games at the 2020 European Championship and the 2021 Champions League final, because European soccer body UEFA is not bound by the ruling. Nor is the Formula 1 racing series, which goes to Sochi's Olympic Park for a race each year.
"The contract is valid through 2025," Russian Grand Prix spokeswoman Tatyana Rivnaya told the AP in a telephone interview.
World championships in lower-profile Olympic sports -- including luge in two months and wrestling in 2022 -- could stay in Russia due to legal difficulties moving them.
"There will be practical issues," Taylor acknowledged, "and we can't ignore those."
However, Taylor said a block on Russia bidding for or being awarded sports events in the next four years would have a longer effect beyond the ban.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC reports that Russia has been handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
It means the Russia flag and anthem will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and football’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal will be able to compete under a neutral flag.
Wada’s executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
It comes after Russia’s Anti Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.
It had to hand over data to Wada as a condition of its controversial reinstatement in 2018 after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.
It has 21 days to appeal against the ban.
A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned at the 2014 Games in Sochi.
Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.
Despite the ban, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 – in which St Petersburg will be a host city – as European football’s governing body Uefa is not defined as a ‘major event organisation’ with regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND -- The Russian flag and national anthem were banned from next year's Tokyo Olympics and other major sports events for four years on Monday.
Russia's hosting of world championships in Olympic sports also face being stripped after the World Anti-Doping Agency executive committee approved a full slate of recommended sanctions as punishment for state authorities tampering with a Moscow laboratory database.
Russian athletes will be allowed to compete in major events only if they are not implicated in positive doping tests or if their data was not manipulated, according to the WADA ruling.
Still, it is unclear how the ruling will affect Russian teams taking part in world championships such as soccer's World Cup.
Russia's anti-doping agency can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days.
Legal fallout from the WADA ruling seems sure to dominate preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which open on July 24.
Evidence shows that Russian authorities tampered with a Moscow laboratory database to hide hundreds of potential doping cases and falsely shift the blame onto whistleblowers, WADA investigators and the International Olympic Committee said last month.

Although the IOC has called for the strongest possible sanctions, it wants those sanctions directed at Russian state authorities rather than athletes or Olympic officials.
That position was opposed by most of WADA's athlete commission. It wanted the kind of blanket ban Russia avoided for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games after a state-run doping program was exposed by media and WADA investigations after Russia hosted the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.
"This entire fiasco created by Russia has cheated far too many athletes of their dreams and rightful careers, for far too long," the WADA athlete panel said in a statement ahead of the meeting.
Russia previously signalled it would appeal the ruling. That must be filed by the Russian anti-doping agency, known as RUSADA. That body was declared non-compliant on Monday, 15 months after it was reinstated by WADA in defiance of athlete opposition.
The decision to appeal has been stripped from RUSADA chief executive Yuri Ganus, an independent figure criticizing Russian authorities' conduct on the doping data issue. Authority was passed to the agency's supervisory board after an intervention led by the Russian Olympic Committee.
The ROC on Saturday labeled the expected sanctions as "illogical and inappropriate."
Russia has stuck to its claim that deceptive edits in the data were in fact made by WADA's star witness, Grigory Rodchenkov. The former Moscow lab director's flight into the witness protection program in the United States was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary.
Technical reasons were claimed -- and debunked by WADA investigators -- for why the data appeared to have been edited shortly before the delayed handover in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia are banned from all international sport for next four years over doping failures... but they could still farcically be allowed to compete at Qatar 2022 as 'NEUTRALS'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia have been banned from the world’s top sporting events for four years, including next summer’s Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Qatar World Cup, for tampering with doping tests.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee acted after concluding that Moscow had planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests in laboratory data that could have helped identify drug cheats.
‘For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,’ said WADA president Craig Reedie, adding that Russia’s actions had demanded a robust response.
But it emerged that the Russian football team will be permitted to take part in World Cup qualifiers next year and, if successful, is likely to compete in the 2022 tournament under a neutral flag despite the four-year ban.
FIFA would only say on Monday that it is ‘in contact with WADA to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football’.
But it is understood the world governing body are set to apply the same rationale that enabled 30 Russian athletes to compete at this year’s World Athletics Championships as ‘Authorized Neutral Athletes’ even though the country have been banned from the sport since 2015 for their state-sponsored doping programme.
Russia’s national side will suffer the embarrassment of being forced to compete as a neutral team four years after hosting a World Cup in which they reached the quarter-finals. They will be prevented from playing the national anthem and using their national flag during Qatar 2022 but the players will not be punished by exclusion.
There will be no restrictions at all during the qualifying process, as that is regarded as a regional tournament run by UEFA.
As a result of that distinction Russia will also be able to compete at Euro 2020, with St Petersburg one of 12 host cities in the first pan-European tournament, as UEFA is not deemed a ‘major event organisation’ with regard to rulings on anti-doping breaches.
The decision to ban Russia was made unanimously at a meeting of WADA’s executive committee in Lausanne on Monday, but the anomalies which will allow athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal to compete at the Tokyo Olympics under a neutral flag were widely criticised.
The ruling follows a judgement in September when Russia’s Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data of drug tests handed over to WADA investigators in January 2019.
The International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee welcomed the decision that is likely to result in them inviting Russian athletes to compete as neutrals in Tokyo next year. RUSADA have been given 21 days to appeal the ban, which would be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
However, WADA vice-president Linda Helleland said the ban was insufficient as Russian athletes and national teams will still be able to compete.
A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at last year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned following the 2014 Games, which it hosted in Sochi.
‘I wanted sanctions that cannot be watered down,’ said Helleland. ‘We owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible.’
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency behind the four-year ban given to Mo Farah’s former coach Alberto Salazar for doping violations earlier this year, said WADA’s decision proved the system was flawed and called for a blanket ban on Russian athletes.
‘To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law,’ said Tygart.
‘In turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.’
Whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian anti-doping official who fled to the United States after his allegations about a state-sponsored doping programme, said in a statement: ‘Finally, fraud, lies and falsifications of unspeakable proportions have been punished in full swing.
‘Those involved in the corruption of certain sports such as track and field, weightlifting, skiing, biathlon and bobsled should be punished retroactively. The results of the London and Sochi Olympic Games should be reanalysed with the new knowledge available today.
‘We only have a few months to reanalyse the samples from the 2012 London Games because according to Wada rules, we only have eight years to review.
‘There is a whole generation of clean athletes who have painfully abandoned their dreams and lost awards because of Russian cheaters. We need to take the strongest action to bring justice.’
Rodchenkov said ‘doped athletes do not work alone’ with ‘medical doctors, coaches and managers’ providing substances, advising and protecting them.
He added: ‘In Russia’s state-sponsored doping scheme, there is also a state-sponsored defence of many cheaters including state officials, witnesses and apparatchiks who are lying under oath and have falsified evidence.’
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev complained that the ban was the result of anti-Russian hysteria in a strong indication that RUSADA are planning to appeal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia hit with four-year Olympic and World Cup ban over doping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia was banished from the Olympics and other international competitions for four years on Monday over a persistent doping scandal, a decision that also threatens to turn President Vladimir Putin and top Kremlin officials into global sporting pariahs.
The World Anti-Doping Agency banned Russia’s national team after officials in Moscow were accused of fabricating evidence to cover up the use of banned substances by the country’s athletes. Individual athletes who comply with strict conditions will be allowed to compete under a neutral flag, while WADA ordered a ban on Russian government officials or representatives attending events.
The measures were “approved unanimously,” WADA said after a meeting of its executive committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, according to Russia’s state-run Tass news service. Russia can appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days.
The punishment means Russia will be kept out of next year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and the 2022 soccer World Cup in Qatar. The ban may also prevent Russia hosting matches in the UEFA Euro 2020 soccer championships next summer, for which the national team has qualified. Russia will also be barred from bidding to host any major championships during the four-year period, extending to include the 2032 Summer Olympics.
Test Anomalies
WADA’s decision followed recommendations last month from its compliance review committee after experts found anomalies in drug test results recovered from a Moscow laboratory in January, under an agreement in September 2018 to lift a previous three-year ban imposed over Russia’s state-backed doping program. The Russian anti-doping chief Yuriy Ganus, who has backed the tough international response, said thousands of doping tests were deleted or modified and he blamed influential former athletes for the deception.
The penalties are a humiliation for Putin, who personally oversaw the spending of tens of billions of dollars to host the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 soccer World Cup as part of his efforts to restore Russia’s Soviet-era image as a sporting superpower. After placing first in the medals table at Sochi, the most expensive Winter Games in history, Russia has since been stripped of 13 of its 33 medals as the scale of its doping program at the games emerged.
Russian track and field athletes were subsequently barred from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. At the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the Olympic flag.
The Kremlin denies the doping allegations, denouncing what it says is an anti-Russian campaign. But the International Olympic Committee has backed WADA, describing the test tampering as a “flagrant manipulation” that is an “attack on the credibility of sport.”
An independent investigation commissioned by WADA found in 2016 that Russian sports officials oversaw a vast program to manipulate doping test results from 2011 to 2015, and that athletes’ positive urine samples were swapped out during the Sochi Olympics.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia to miss Tokyo 2020 Olympics after four-year ban from major sporting events by Wada</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned Russia from global sporting events, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, after accusing Moscow of falsifying data from an anti-doping laboratory.
The ban means that Russia will not be allowed to compete at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and football’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar, according to a report by BBC Sport.
Not only will Russia be ruled out of the next Olympic cycle, but Russian government officials will be barred from attending any major events, while the country will lose the right to host, or even bid, for tournaments.
“Wada’s executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years,” Wada spokesman James Fitzgerald said.
Under the sanctions, Russian sportsmen and women will still be allowed to compete at the Olympics next year but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what Wada believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.
“They are going to have prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation,” Fitzgerald said.
The independent report by Richard McLaren, released in 2016, revealed the significant extent of state-sponsored doping in Russia, notably between 2011 and 2015.
It led to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations of a vast state-supported doping programme.
Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia’s controversial reinstatement by Wada in September 2018.
The Wada decision was widely predicted, with the body’s president, Craig Reedie, having made a presentation Saturday to the Olympic Summit, participants of which “strongly condemned those responsible for the manipulation of the data from the Moscow laboratory”.
“It was agreed that this was an attack on sport and that these actions should lead to the toughest sanctions against those responsible,” the IOC said in a statement.
“It was stressed by the participants that full justice must be finally done so that the guilty ones can be properly punished and the innocent ones are fully protected.”
The IOC asked that the Russian authorities deliver the “fully authenticated raw data”.
Former Wada president Dick Pound, who chaired the commission that in 2015 made damning accusations of mass doping in Russian athletics, said Moscow had this time gone “too far”.
“The IOC is a little bit tired about what Russia has been doing and so I see the IOC probably focusing more on athletes who are newer,” Pound told AFP.
Pound acknowledged the influential role of Russia – which in recent years hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the football World Cup in 2018 – “on many levels” in the sporting world.
“On the field of play, it is a big, important country. With China and the United States, it’s among the sporting giants, so that’s influential,” he said.
“It’s (also) influential because Russia hosts and is willing to host many competitions for international federations, especially those who don’t have much money of their own, so they have a considerable influence among the international federations.
“And they’ve been quite strategic about making sure that they get Russians into positions on international federations. So they have an impact from inside as well as from outside.”
A majority of Wada’s influential athlete committee had called overnight for a “complete ban on Russian participation”, nine members of the 17-strong group saying such a move was “the only meaningful sanction”.
“We maintain that the fraud, manipulation and deception revealed to date will only be encouraged and perpetuated with a lesser response,” they said.
“To date, the Russian doping saga has dominated three Olympic and Paralympic Games, with a fourth on the horizon. Russia’s ongoing and intentional acts of deception, fraud and corruption have made a mockery not only those who play by the rules, but those who create and safeguard them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">World Anti-Doping Agency imposes 4-year ban on Russia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — Russia was slapped Monday with a four-year ban from international sports events, including next summer’s Tokyo Olympics, over a longstanding doping scandal, although its athletes will still be able to compete if they can show they are clean competitors.
The ruling by the World Anti-Doping Agency’s executive committee means that Russia’s flag, name and anthem will not appear at the Tokyo Games, and the country also could be stripped of hosting world championships in Olympic sports.
The sanctions are the harshest punishment yet for Russian state authorities who were accused of tampering with a Moscow laboratory database. Russia’s anti-doping agency can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days — an action it has signaled it would take.
Russian athletes will be allowed to compete in major events only if they are not implicated in positive doping tests or if their data was not manipulated, according to the WADA ruling.
For soccer’s 2022 World Cup, WADA said the Russian team will play under its name in the qualifying program in Europe. If it qualifies for Qatar, the name will have be changed to something neutral that likely would not include the word “Russia.”
Legal fallout from the WADA ruling seems sure to dominate preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which open on July 24.
Evidence shows that Russian authorities tampered with a Moscow laboratory database to hide hundreds of potential doping cases and falsely shift the blame onto whistleblowers, WADA investigators and the International Olympic Committee said last month.
“Flagrant manipulation” of the Moscow lab data was “an insult to the sporting movement worldwide,” the IOC said last month.
WADA’s inability to fully expel Russia from the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games frustrated the doping watchdog’s vice president.
“I’m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,” said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian lawmaker who serves on WADA executive committee and has long pushed for a tougher line against Russia. “This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologize on all the pain all the athletes and sports fans have experienced.”
Handing over a clean database to WADA was a key requirement for Russia to help bring closure to a scandal that has tainted the Olympics over the last decade.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia are set to miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulation of laboratory data after the doping scandal that has rocked sport. Their executive committee concluded Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify cheats. The WADA board convened for a special meeting on Monday close to the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and ruled unanimously in favour of the global ban.

It is the most severe punishment yet connected to the cheating scheme, which peaked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The punishments come four years after details of the doping scheme were made public, with specific bans on Russian sports and government officials which prohibits the country from hosting international events. Russia could still contest the decision and look set to do so as it continues to deny many allegations despite several independent investigations finding wrongdoing. Officials from the country have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but if unsuccessful then they face missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the Olympics in Tokyo 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WADA executive committee bans Russia from Olympics, world championships for 4 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports for four years on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, a WADA spokesman said.
WADA's executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats.
The WADA committee's decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, the spokesman said.
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Russia's doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.
Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.
The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA's executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.

Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.
The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA’s executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia banned from Olympics and World Cup for doping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia has been banned from major international sports events for four years by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in the latest development in the years-long doping scandal which has seen the country stripped of 30 medals since 2008.
The ban was imposed by WADA’s Executive Committee at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday. The 12-member committee's decision was unanimous.
The ruling comes after the WADA's compliance committee found "Moscow data was intentionally altered prior to and while it was being forensically copied by WADA in January 2019."
The ban means the Russian flag and anthem will not be allowed at major events like the 2020 Olympics to be held in Tokyo as well as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Russia hosted the last World Cup in 2018.
WADA President Sir Craig Reedie said Russia had missed its chance to get its house in order.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport," Sir Craig said.
"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial."
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts."
Russia must pay WADA's costs incurred since January 2019 plus the lower of either a fine of 10 per cent or USD $100,000 within four years.
Russia has 21 days to appeal.
Russian athletes who are untainted by the country's years-long doping scandal can still compete but may not represent the Russian Federation.
Jonathan Taylor from the compliance committee said a blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing would be unfair.
"While I understand the calls for a blanket ban on all Russian athletes whether or not they are implicated by the data, it was the unanimous view ... that ... those who could prove their innocence should not be punished," Taylor said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shocking! World Anti-Doping Agency bans Russia from Tokyo Olympics, World Cup Football in Qatar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a huge blow to Russia’s future sporting ambition, the World Anti-Doping Agency, also known as WADA, on Monday banned the country from taking part in all major sporting events such as the next year’s Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Football World Cup scheduled to be held in Qatar for the next four years.
The WADA, however, said that the Russian athletes can still part in these competitions if they are able to demonstrate that they have been untainted. These athletes, if allowed, will have to take part under neutral flags.
Taking the remarkable decision unanimously in Lausanne in Switzerland, Wada’s executive committee handed out a four-year ban to Russia. This came months after the WADA declared the Russian anti-doping body non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.
Rusada boss Yuri Ganus, according to BBC, has since confirmed that someone altered or deleted ‘thousands’ of entries.
Russia may also be barred from hosting or bidding for or be granted the right to host any major events for four years, during the ban period. Russia may also not be allowed to bid for the right to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, irrespective of whether the bidding takes place during or after the four-year period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BREAKING: Russia banned from all major sporting events for four years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia are set to miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulation of laboratory data after the doping scandal that has rocked sport. Their executive committee concluded Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify cheats. The WADA board convened for a special meeting on Monday close to the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and ruled unanimously in favour of the global ban.

It is the most severe punishment yet connected to the cheating scheme, which peaked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The punishments come four years after details of the doping scheme were made public, with specific bans on Russian sports and government officials which prohibits the country from hosting international events. Russia could still contest the decision and look set to do so as it continues to deny many allegations despite several independent investigations finding wrongdoing. Officials from the country have 21 days to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but if unsuccessful then they face missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the Olympics in Tokyo 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia banned from major sporting events for four years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Anti-Doping Agency has voted unanimously to ban Russia from international sport for four years for doping offences.
Russia now have 21 days to appeal against the sentence, which would see the country banned from participating at next summer’s Olympics in Tokyo and the Qatar 2022 World Cup.
They will, however, still be able compete in next year’s European football championships, where they will also be one of the host countries. As for the World Cup, Fifa said it was in discussions with Wada “to clarify the extent of the decision”. Individual Russian athletes will furthermore be able to compete under a neutral banner at the Olympics, providing they can prove they are drug free. Under similar conditions, 30 Russians competed at this year’s World Athletics Championships as “Authorized Neutral Athletes”.
The new punishment was agreed by Wada’s executive committee (ExCo) at a special meeting convened at the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland. It is the most severe sanction yet against the country, which has been accused of running a systemic doping programme and deleting crucial laboratory evidence.
Wada’s president Sir Craig Reedie said: “For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
“As a result, the Wada ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.”
Some within Wada were more critical of the decision, saying it fell short of the ultimate sanction of a blanket ban for Russia and its athletes.
“I’m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,” said Linda Helleland, a Norwegian politician who is the Wada vice-president and a vocal critic of Russian doping.
”This is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologise [FOR]all the pain athletes and sports fans have experienced.”
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of Usada who had previously said anything but a blanket ban on all Russia athletes would be “inadequate”, said Wada’s decision proved the system was flawed. “To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law,” Tygart said. “And, in turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.”
Russian authorities have strongly criticised the decision. The country’s ruling party described the ban as “politicised” and the deputy speaker of Russia’s parliament called it “a way of ousting Russian competitors from global sports.”
The head of Russia’s biathlon federation, Vladimir Drachev, called the decision “extremely wrong and biased” during a live interview broadcast on Russian state television. “Much has been done in Russian sport recently, athletes have undergone tests for doping, all the cases [OF DOPING]in Russia are part of the past.”
Evidence of wide-spread Russian doping was first revealed by Wada four years ago with a report claiming that at least 643 positive tests had been hidden by authorities. That resulted in the suspension of the Russian Athletics Federation (Rusaf) and 111 individual athletes being banned from the 2016 games in Rio.
Last year Wada made the controversial decision to reinstate the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) on the condition that it complied with requests to share its laboratory results. Those results were subsequently found to have been tampered with, and led to renewed calls for punishment. “Flagrant manipulation” of the Moscow lab data was “an insult to the sporting movement worldwide,” the IOC said last month.
If Russia, as is likely, does choose to appeal the punishment, it will subsequently be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In a statement, the UK anti-doping body Ukad called for any appeal to be heard as quickly as possible.
“This was the only possible outcome that the WADA ExCo could take to reassure athletes and the public and continue the task of seeking justice for those cheated b Russian athletes”, said Ukad ’s chief executive Nicole Sapstead.
“We know however that this is not necessarily the end of the matter. If RUSADA choose to appeal this decision to CAS, this must be carried out with minimal delay, especially in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.” - Guardian

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia's four-year ban from all major sporting events branded as 'not enough' by WADA vice-president</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia has been banned from the 2020 Olympics and the 2022 football World Cup.
The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday confirmed a four-year ban from all major global sporting events, after considering recommendations from its independent compliance review committee (CRC) that Russia had manipulated laboratory doping data.
However, WADA's vice-president Linda Helleland said the ban was "not enough".
"I wanted sanctions that can not be watered down," she said. "We owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible."
The judgement means Russia will be banned from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar.
WADA said the decision was unanimous and its president Craig Reedie accused Russia of choosing "deception and denial" rather than getting its house in order.
Russia has 21 days to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, while individual Russian athletes untainted by the scandal will be able to compete independently under a neutral flag.
Reedie said: "The ExCo's (executive committee) strong decision today shows WADA's determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis, thanks to the agency's robust investigatory capability, the vision of the CRC, and WADA's recently acquired ability to recommend meaningful sanctions via the compliance standard which entered into effect in April 2018.
"Combined, these strengths have enabled the ExCo to make the right decisions at the right time.
"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA's reinstatement conditions, approved by the ExCo in September 2018, demanded a robust response.
"That is exactly what has been delivered today. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and rejoin the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
"As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.
"On behalf of the ExCo, and of the many WADA stakeholders that supported the CRC recommendation, I would like to thank the members of the CRC for their expert and considered recommendation, as well as WADA I&I and the forensic experts for their skill, diligence and perseverance in getting to the bottom of this highly complex case."
However, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 next summer, having qualified for an event that will see some games take place in St Petersburg.
European football's governing body does not fall under the definition of a Major Events Organisation under the international compliance code.
The CRC made its recommendations based on evidence presented to it by WADA's intelligence and investigations (I&I) team.
The I&I team found there were inconsistencies in data handed over to WADA in January 2019 by Russia under the terms of its reinstatement to compliance in September 2018.
The data provided was inconsistent with a copy of the database supplied to WADA by a whistleblower in 2017, in that positive findings present in 2017 were missing from the 2019 data.
The I&I team found that some of the manipulation and deletion had occurred as recently as December 2018 and January 2019 - after reinstatement.
Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015 when it was first declared non-compliant.
UK Anti-Doping welcomed the ban on Russia in a statement by saying it was the "only possible outcome".
UKAD chief executive Nicole Sapstead said: "We welcome today's decision to declare RUSADA non-compliant, and the decisive action by WADA's executive committee to impose four-year sanctions on Russian athletes and support personnel.
"This was the only possible outcome that the WADA ExCo could take to reassure athletes and the public and continue the task of seeking justice for those cheated by Russian athletes.
"We know however that this is not necessarily the end of the matter. If RUSADA choose to appeal this decision to CAS, this must be carried out with minimal delay, especially in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.
"We welcome the clear and detailed communication from WADA today which is vital in helping to maintain confidence in the global anti-doping system."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arlene Foster accuses PM of breaking his word over Brexit deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUP leader says Boris Johnson has betrayed unionist voters in Northern Ireland
Boris Johnson has been accused of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, three days before the general election
The Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, said the prime minister betrayed unionist voters in Northern Ireland when he sealed a deal with the EU that would introduce a trade barrier down the Irish Sea, contrary to a personal promise he had made when he spoke at their annual conference last year.
It meant the party could no longer take Johnson at his word. Foster said in future the party, if returned to Westminster, would have to check if what he said “was actually factually correct”.
She added: “Once bitten, twice shy, we will certainly be looking for the detail of what this [Brexit] is going to look like,”
Her comments put Johnson on notice once again that his Brexit deal is under threat if a hung parliament is returned on Thursday and the DUP’s votes hold the balance of power.
When Johnson announced his deal in October, the DUP was told by HM Revenue & Customs that it would entail new checks on goods, Foster told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“We asked them a number of questions on goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB, and they were very clear with us that all of the goods would have to be checked. Of course, only the goods going to Republic of Ireland would have tariffs, but that would be the default position,” she said.
Her comments came as a freshly leaked document, written by officials in the government’s Brexit department, warns that Johnson’s aim to implement his deal by the end of 2020 presents a major challenge because of the need to create new protocols and systems for business in Northern Ireland.
The document, obtained by the Financial Times, claims that 98% of export businesses are “likely to struggle to bear the cost” of the extra paperwork, fuelling concerns of increased prices for consumers.
The government dismissed a similar document leaked to the Labour party on Friday as instant analysis done when Johnson brought home his Brexit deal in October.
The further document leaked to the FT over the weekend raises doubts that the new controls for Northern Ireland could be in place by the end of 2020, when Johnson pledges to have completed his exit deal
The Department for Exiting the EU document was circulated last week and warns that in order to meet the December deadline, “delivery on the ground” of the new protocols and systems would have to take place before officials know the outcome of the next stage of negotiations.
“Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge,” it said.
With three days to go until the election, the Conservative party has stuck rigidly to its claim, with the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, saying on Monday morning there would be no checks.
Only a month ago, Johnson told businesses in Northern Ireland he was so sure there would be no checks and that if they got any forms they could “throw them in the bin”.
Foster was asked how it felt to be hailing Johnson as “the saviour of the union” one moment and then for him to do a deal that her party believes is “betraying the union”. “I think it says more about who broke their word than me and the leadership of the unionist party,” she said.
On Sky News on Sunday, Johnson went so far as to say a leaked Treasury document claims by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, that exit declaration forms would be required on goods from Northern Ireland to GB were “wrong”.
Pressed on the document stating there would be “checks both ways”, Johnson said: “That’s wrong because there won’t be checks”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DUP accuses Boris Johnson of breaking his word on union commitment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PM is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands as the election campaign enters its final few days.
Boris Johnson has been accused of breaking his word over his commitment to protect the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
As the Prime Minister faced fresh questions over trade within the UK after Brexit, Arlene Foster said Government officials had told her there would need to be checks.
Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about the sense of some in the unionist community that Mr Johnson’s deal was a “betrayal”, she said: “I think it is right for the leadership of unionism in Northern Ireland to try to work with the prime minister of the day to get the best deal for Northern Ireland.
“We will always do that. We will continue to do that. I think it says more about the person who broke their word than me and the leadership of the… Democratic Unionist Party.”
She said the DUP had been told by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials before the PM announced his deal that there would be checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland.
Mrs Foster said a lack of free-flowing trade would cause “economic instability in Northern Ireland, which will lead to higher costs for retailers which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland”.
“And all of that leads me to say that we need to – after this election is over, and I’m not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count – but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland.”
Mrs Foster has kept a low profile in the election campaign thus far, and her intervention will be seen by some as an attempt to highlight a need for the DUP’s role in holding sway in the event of a hung parliament.
Her comments came after Labour released a leaked Treasury report last week that concluded customs checks and possibly even tariffs could be required on goods travelling in both directions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But Mr Johnson told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme over the weekend that the report was “wrong” and added that the six counties would have “unfettered access” to the UK market.
With just a few days to go until polls open, the PM is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands in a bid to convince Leave voters that Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position is akin to a “great betrayal”, and will say there are just “three days to get Brexit done”.
He has consistently vowed to take the UK out of the EU by January 31 and then finalise a trade deal with Brussels within 11 months to meet the transition period deadline.
Arrangements would also need to be signed off that allow Northern Ireland to continue to follow Brussels and Dublin rules on the trade of goods to ensure there is no hard border.
But a Whitehall report seen by the Financial Times highlights the difficultly involved for the Government in bringing in the infrastructure in time for the UK to leave when the PM has pledged.
A Department for Exiting the European Union document, according to the FT, states that: “Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the (Northern Ireland) protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.”
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will set out his party’s main priorities for the first 100 days of a Labour government.
He will say that the first priority for the Treasury under Labour will be ending the Conservatives’ programme of cuts to public spending and social security.
“In our first hundred days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership,” he will say.
“We’ll set up boards to run them made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.
“We’ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services – those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before.
“So you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we’ll create new People’s Assemblies to hold these boards to account and give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run.”

She said the DUP had been told by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials before the PM announced his deal that there would be checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland.
Mrs Foster said a lack of free-flowing trade would cause “economic instability in Northern Ireland, which will lead to higher costs for retailers which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland”.
“And all of that leads me to say that we need to – after this election is over, and I’m not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count – but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland.”
Mrs Foster has kept a low profile in the election campaign thus far, and her intervention will be seen by some as an attempt to highlight a need for the DUP’s role in holding sway in the event of a hung parliament.
Her comments came after Labour released a leaked Treasury report last week that concluded customs checks and possibly even tariffs could be required on goods travelling in both directions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But Mr Johnson told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme over the weekend that the report was “wrong” and added that the six counties would have “unfettered access” to the UK market.
With just a few days to go until polls open, the PM is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands in a bid to convince Leave voters that Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position is akin to a “great betrayal”, and will say there are just “three days to get Brexit done”.
He has consistently vowed to take the UK out of the EU by January 31 and then finalise a trade deal with Brussels within 11 months to meet the transition period deadline.
Arrangements would also need to be signed off that allow Northern Ireland to continue to follow Brussels and Dublin rules on the trade of goods to ensure there is no hard border.
But a Whitehall report seen by the Financial Times highlights the difficultly involved for the Government in bringing in the infrastructure in time for the UK to leave when the PM has pledged.
A Department for Exiting the European Union document, according to the FT, states that: “Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the (Northern Ireland) protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.”
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will set out his party’s main priorities for the first 100 days of a Labour government.
He will say that the first priority for the Treasury under Labour will be ending the Conservatives’ programme of cuts to public spending and social security.
“In our first hundred days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership,” he will say.
“We’ll set up boards to run them made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.
“We’ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services – those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before.
“So you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we’ll create new People’s Assemblies to hold these boards to account and give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Once bitten twice shy': Arlene Foster warns Boris Johnson he may not be able to count on DUP support after the election as she demands written guarantees there will not be customs checks between the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arlene Foster has warned Boris Johnson he may not be able to count on the DUP's support unless he provides them with cast iron guarantees there will not be customs checks between the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit.  
Mr Johnson said yesterday that 'there's no question of there being checks on goods' travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK or the other way around. 
But there is growing confusion over whether that would be the case with suggestions that the Prime Minister's Brexit deal would see checks carried out on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. 
Ms Foster said today her party would continue to oppose the premier's divorce accord as she said Mr Johnson's statements were not enough to win the DUP's support. 
She suggested her party would need something in writing to confirm Mr Johnson's claims before it would consider backing another Tory government as she accused the PM of breaking his word on Brexit.  
Mr Johnson had stood alongside the DUP leadership at the Conservative Party's annual conference in October and stressed the importance of the Union. 
But the DUP believe Mr Johnson effectively sacrificed the Union in order to secure a deal with Brussels which the party believes will see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK. 
Asked this morning if she would take Mr Johnson at his word, Ms Foster told the BBC: 'I think once bitten twice shy we will certainly be looking for the detail of what this is going to look like. 
'That is why in the week leading up to the deal we were engaged with trade officials, we were engaged with officials from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to make sure that what was being said was actually factually correct. 
'We will continue to do that.'
Opinion polls suggest Mr Johnson is on course to win a majority at the general election on Thursday. 
But should the polls narrow and the PM fail to win a majority then the DUP and its likely handful of MPs could be key to whether he is able to stay in power. 
But as it stands the party is adamant that it cannot support Mr Johnson's Brexit agreement.    
Ms Foster said: 'It is very important for us in Northern Ireland not just to have the word but to have the detail. 
'We want to see the detail. We did see the detail of that week when we spoke to HMRC officials and they said that this would be what would happen, that there would be checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland, something which will cause economic instability in Northern Ireland which will lead to higher costs for retailers, which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland. 
'All of that leads me to say that we need to, after this election is over, and I am not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count, but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland. 
'Because in the event of a hung Parliament or in the event even of a small majority for a Conservative leader we will be wanting clarity and we will be wanting to make sure that we deal with this customs issue.'
It came as a leaked government document suggested delivering the customs arrangements related to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit relationship with the UK by December 2020 would be a 'major challenge'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'An outright lie': Ohio lawmaker shown to be linked to group pushing rightwing Christian bills</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timothy Ginter, who said he had ‘no knowledge’ of Project Blitz, was listed as co-chair of state branch of group behind the campaign
An Ohio legislator who said he had “no knowledge” of a rightwing Christian bill mill called Project Blitz is, in fact, the co-chair of the state branch of an organization behind the campaign.
The Ohio state representative Timothy Ginter sponsored a bill called the Student Religious Liberties Act. Opponents argued the bill would provide students with a religious exemption to facts, and would frighten teachers and school administrators into including religion in school functions.
The Guardian revealed the bill was nearly identical to one promoted by Project Blitz, a state legislative project guided by three Christian right organizations, including the Congressional Prayer Caucus (CPC), WallBuilders and the ProFamily Legislators Conference. Project Blitz aims to promote and help pass conservative legislation across the US to fulfil its rightwing Christian agenda.
When initially approached, Ginter told the Guardian in an email from a legislative aide that he had “no knowledge of ‘Project Blitz’ and has not been working with WallBuilders or the Congressional Prayer Caucus”.
However, a screenshot shows Ginter was listed as the co-chair of the Ohio Prayer Caucus, the state chapter of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, as recently as January 2019. Ginter’s former chief of staff, Chris Albanese, is currently listed as the state director of the state chapter of CPC, Ohio Prayer Caucus.
“I would call it an outright lie,” said Frederick Clarkson, a senior research analyst with Political Research Associates, and an expert on the Christian right. “The Prayer Caucus in the states are the action arm of Project Blitz – it is Project Blitz,” he said. “When he told you, ‘I’ve never heard of Project Blitz,’ that was a lie,” said Clarkson.
The Guardian repeatedly called and emailed both Ginter and the the Republican Ohio house speaker, Larry Householder. Neither responded to these phone or email requests.
In a statement at the time, Ginter argued the bill was necessary because, “well-funded groups” were intimidating school officials with “the thread of litigation”. His bill, he argued, would clarify their responsibilities.
Ginter also argued the Student Religious Liberties Bill was not a Christian bill, because it does not explicitly mention Christianity. However, the Ohio Prayer Caucus he co-chaired explicitly lays out that it support legislators “who are standing for faith, morality and Judeo-Christian principles”.
The Congressional Prayer Caucus also circulated an Ohio Prayer Proclamation. Among its signers are Ginter; the former representative Bill Hayes, who originally sponsored the bill; and the former House speaker Cliff Rosenberger. Rosenberger resigned in 2018 after a search warrant and subpoena revealed the FBI was investigating Rosenberger for corruption involving three payday lending representatives, according to the Dayton Daily News.
Prominent defenders of religious liberties, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League, oppose the legislation. Republicans in the Ohio House passed the legislation with a party-line vote in November. It has not yet been taken up by the Ohio senate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sanna Marin of Finland to Become World’s Youngest Prime Minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HELSINKI, Finland — Sanna Marin, 34, is set to become the world’s youngest sitting prime minister when she is sworn in this week in Finland, after being elected to the position by her party late Sunday.
The country’s coalition government consists of five parties, four of which are led by women, with Ms. Marin now at the helm. Four of the women are under the age of 35, which Finnish political experts say is more significant, symbolic of the rise of a new generation of politicians in the Nordic nation, which has had strong female representation for decades.
“The past week has been extraordinary,” she told reporters, according to Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper. “Now is the time to look ahead. What is needed now is action beyond words to build trust from all government parties.”
Formerly the country’s transportation minister, Ms. Marin was voted in by fellow lawmakers in her Social Democratic Party after a turbulent week in which Prime Minister Antti Rinne resigned over his handling of a postal workers strike.
Although Mr. Rinne will continue as head of the party, Parliament is expected to confirm Ms. Marin as prime minister as soon as Tuesday, depending on how quickly the other coalition parties name their ministers. Once sworn in, she will be Finland’s youngest prime minister to date and its third female prime minister.
Ms. Marin, a left-leaning liberal, has been a member of Parliament since 2015. She began her political career in 2012, when she was elected to the local council in the southern city of Tampere. Most recently she was minister of transportation and communications in Mr. Rinne’s government.
Serving as Mr. Rinne’s deputy when he took an extended sick leave earlier this year, she helped lead their party to a narrow win in national elections.
Alexander Stubb, who was Finland’s prime minister from 2014 to 2015, posted on Twitter that having a government led by women “shows that #Finland is a modern and progressive country.”
“One day, gender will not matter in government,” he wrote. “Meanwhile pioneers.”
Of the five women in leading ministerial positions in the coalition, four are under 35. Asked about her age after it was announced that she would be prime minister, Ms. Marin reiterated what she has said numerous times: Age doesn’t matter.
“I have not actually ever thought about my age or my gender,” she said, according to the national news outlet YLE. “I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate.”
She outlined her political ethos in a letter to fellow party members ahead of the decision on Sunday, asking for their support. She noted that she had benefited from the welfare state throughout her life, especially during “difficult times” and said that ensuring its strength was a priority for her.
“I got to live a safe childhood, have an education and pursue my dreams,” she wrote. “Enabling it for everyone has driven me into politics.”
While Ms. Marin’s new role has drawn attention globally, Anne Holli, a political science professor at the University of Helsinki, said it was unsurprising, in Finland where women’s representation in Parliament has been strong for decades.
In the 1983 election, women held 30 percent of the seats. By the 2007 election, they made up more than 40 percent of lawmakers, and they make up 47 percent in the parliamentary term that began this year.
“We have actually a very broad base of women in politics, and we have had a pretty equal situation in the political sphere for more than 35 years,” Ms. Holli said. “I think one can kind of expect this sooner or later.”
She said the sudden attention to the young female lawmakers has been jarring. “Nobody has been calling me when there are young male party leaders,” she said.
Ms. Holli said it was the youth of Ms. Marin and her fellow government leaders that was unusual, rather than their gender.
“It’s kind of a change of generations,” she said.
Ms. Marin won the leadership vote by a small margin, and her skills will be put to the test immediately as the country heads into a season of labor negotiations with the potential for strikes. Her predecessor, Mr. Rinne, was ultimately forced out of office after he made comments about a plan to cut wages for postal workers and his coalition partner, the Center Party, said it had lost confidence in him.
Despite his resignation, the coalition’s parties will remain unaltered: Ms. Marin’s Social Democratic Party as Finland’s biggest, the Center Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland.
The Social Democratic Party will vote at its convention next June to determine whether Mr. Rinne will continue to lead the party or whether Ms. Marin or someone else will formally take over. Many analysts say Ms. Marin is likely to win the contest for party leadership.
The coalition government under Ms. Marin is expected to continue prioritizing job creation and ambitious climate goals, seeking to render Finland carbon neutral by 2035.
Tuomas Yla-Anttila, an associate professor of political science at the University of Helsinki said that Ms. Marin’s appointment as prime minister has symbolic value in the country, but is also a reflection of strides in gender equality.
“For a long time we had the situation in Finland where there were only men, now there are women, sometimes it goes the other way round,” he said, pointing to the all-female government leadership.
He said Ms. Marin’s youth likely helped her win the support of the troubled Social Democratic Party as it looks to reform and move away from the politics of Mr. Rinne. In Finland, he added, her age was a more important political factor than her sex.
“The party surely wanted a younger prime minister,” he said. “Her young age is more important than being a woman. She represents a new generation of politicians.”
Jenni Karimaki, a senior researcher at the Center for Parliamentary Studies at the University of Turku, said that in many ways Ms. Marin was a natural choice. She is the first deputy of the party and has served as a government minister, positions that traditionally have been springboards to the prime minister’s office.
“There is demand at the moment for young women in key positions,” Ms. Karimaki said, and pointed to the fact that many other young, female politicians won office in April’s national election.
Ms. Karimaki said Ms. Marin also symbolized the new start that the Social Democrats have been looking for and represented “a strengthening of representative democracy.”
“Now the picture is changing of what kind of people can bear high-level political responsibility,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India Steps Toward Making Naturalization Harder for Muslims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HYDERABAD, India — India took a major step toward the official marginalization of Muslims on Tuesday as one house of Parliament passed a bill that would establish a religious test for migrants who want to become citizens, solidifying Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.
The measure would give migrants of all of South Asia’s major religions a clear path to Indian citizenship — except Islam. It is the most significant move yet to profoundly alter India’s secular nature enshrined by its founding leaders when the country gained independence in 1947.
The bill passed in the lower house, the Lok Sabha, a few minutes after midnight, following a few hours of debate. The vote was 311 to 80. The measure now moves to the upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where Mr. Modi seems to have enough allies that most analysts predict it will soon become law.
Muslim Indians are deeply unsettled. They see the new measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, as the first step by the governing party to make second-class citizens of India’s 200 million Muslims, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and render many of them stateless.
“We are heading toward totalitarianism, a fascist state,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim lawmaker, who on Monday dramatically tore up a copy of the bill while giving a speech in Parliament. “We are making India a theocratic country.”
The legislation goes hand in hand with a contentious program that began in the northeastern state of Assam this year, in which all 33 million residents of the state had to prove, with documentary evidence, that they or their ancestors were Indian citizens. Approximately two million people — many of them Muslims, and many of them lifelong residents of India — were left off the state’s citizenship rolls after that exercise.
Now, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is hoping to expand that kind of citizenship test to other states. And the new legislation would become a guiding principle for who could hope to call themselves Indians.
Mr. Modi and his party are deeply rooted in an ideology that sees India as a Hindu nation. And since the B.J.P.’s landslide re-election win in May, Mr. Modi’s administration has celebrated one Hindu nationalist victory after another, each a demoralizing drumbeat for Muslims.
First came the Assam citizenship tests. Then Mr. Modi stripped away autonomy and statehood for Kashmir, which used to be India’s only Muslim-majority state. And last month, Hindu fundamentalists scored a big court victory allowing them to build a new temple over the ruins of a demolished mosque in the flash point city of Ayodhya.
With the new citizenship bill, Mr. Modi’s party says it is simply trying to protect persecuted Hindus, Buddhists and Christians (and members of a few smaller religions) who migrate from predominantly Muslim countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan.
But the legislation would also make it easier to incarcerate and deport Muslim residents, even those whose families have been in India for generations, if they cannot produce proof of citizenship.
Under Mr. Modi’s leadership, anti-Muslim sentiment has become blatantly more mainstream and public. Intimidation and attacks against Muslim communities have increased in recent years. And overt displays of Hindu piety and nationalism have become central in pop culture and politics.
Mr. Modi’s fellow lawmakers in the B.J.P. are unapologetic about their pro-Hindu position.
“There are Muslim countries, there are Jew countries, everybody has their own identity. And we are a billion-plus, right? We must have one identity,” said Ravi Kishan, a famous action-film hero and member of Parliament who is a central supporter of the citizenship legislation.
When asked if he was trying to turn India into a Hindu nation, he laughed. “India has always been a Hindu nation,” he said. “The Muslims also are Hindus.” (This is a common Hindu nationalist belief: that India’s Muslims are relatively recent converts, even though Islam arrived in India hundreds of years ago.)
Even before lawmakers in the Lok Sabha voted, protests were breaking out.
In Assam, where the citizenship program began last summer, thousands of people have marched in the streets, hoisting placards and torches and shouting out their opposition to the bill.
People are talking of mass fasts and boycotts of schools and markets. On Monday, some hanged effigies of Mr. Modi and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister.
The leaders of the opposition Indian National Congress party are trying to paint the bill as a danger to India’s democracy. After India won its independence, its founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru among them, made a clear decision: Even though the country was 80 percent Hindu, it would not be an officially Hindu nation. Minorities, especially Muslims, would be treated equally.
Rahul Gandhi, a party leader and great-grandson of Mr. Nehru, said, “India belongs to everybody — all communities, all religions, all cultures.” Shashi Tharoor, the party’s intellectual heavyweight, called the bill an “all-out assault on the very idea of India.”
But the Congress party is at a low point in its 100-year-plus history. And Mr. Modi’s party has the numbers: With allies, it controls nearly two-thirds of the seats in the lower house.
Some of Mr. Modi’s critics believe the bill is serving to distract the public from another pressing issue: the economy. For the first time in decades, India’s economy is slowing significantly. It is still huge, but several big industries, like car and motorcycle manufacturing, have seen sales plummet like never before.
“The economy is in tatters,” said Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer in Assam. The bill, he said, was “the only issue left to polarize the country and distract people.”
But forging India into an overtly Hindu nation has been a core goal of Mr. Modi’s party and of the R.S.S., a right-wing volunteer group whose ranks Mr. Modi rose up through and which provides him a backbone of support. And India’s recent moves in Kashmir, along with the Ayodhya temple ruling and the Assam citizenship tests, have been hugely popular with the prime minister’s base.
Earlier this year, Mr. Modi’s government tried to push similar citizenship legislation. The bill sailed through the lower house but stalled after many politicians in Assam said they did not like the religious dimension the B.J.P. was injecting — or the possibility that a large number of Hindu Bengalis would be made citizens and would be able to legally acquire land in Assam.
The bill gathered new momentum this fall, after the citizenship test in Assam. Assam has witnessed waves of migration over the years, and many of those people whose citizenship was being questioned were migrants, both Hindus and Muslims, from neighboring Bangladesh.
Mr. Shah, the home minister and architect of the B.J.P.’s recent political victories, promised to protect the Hindus and other non-Muslims. He has called illegal migrants from Bangladesh “termites,” and along with his other statements made clear that Muslims were his target. Mr. Shah has also promised to impose the citizenship test from Assam on the entire country.
The citizenship bill is a piece of the campaign to identify and deport Muslims who have been living in India for years, critics of the bill say. It lays out a path to Indian citizenship for migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they can prove they have been in India for at least five years and ascribe to the specified religions.
To overcome the resistance from politicians in Assam, who do not want Hindu or Muslim migrants taking their land, the new version of the bill carves out special protections for areas predominated by indigenous people.
Mr. Modi’s supporters employ a certain logic when defending the bill’s exclusion of Muslims. They say Muslims are not persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, which is mostly true. They also say that when India and Pakistan were granted independence in 1947, the British carved out Pakistan as a haven for Muslims, while India remained predominantly Hindu. To them, the extension of that process is to ask illegal Muslims migrants to leave India and seek refuge in neighboring, mainly Muslim nations.
Article 25 of the Indian Constitution says, “All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.” Given that, many opponents of the bill say the citizenship legislation is patently unconstitutional. But the Hindu nationalists have an answer for that, as well.
“We are not talking about citizens,” said Ramesh Shinde, a spokesman for the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, a Hindu organization that is considered a far-right group. “We are talking about migrants.”
Both sides agree on one thing: The bill could have far-reaching consequences.
The Indian government is already racing to build an enormous network of prisons to house thousands of migrants. If immigration law is applied selectively, Hindu migrants who are swept up in raids may be released and allowed to apply for citizenship, while Muslim migrants could instead be sent to detention camps, opponents say.
“In every state, Muslims are running around for papers,” said Mr. Wadud, the human rights lawyer in Assam. “An environment of fear has been created.”
Mr. Kishan, the action hero turned politician, said he would next push to change India’s name to Bharat, the traditional Hindi word for India. But he said that he was not anti-Muslim, and that Muslims living in India legally had nothing to fear.
“How can I be anti-Muslim? My staff in Mumbai is Muslim,” he said.
“Hindus and Muslims in India are like this,” he said, interlacing his fingers. “But,” he added with a big smile, “I love Hindus.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michelle Wolf Doesn’t Want to Be Your Folk Hero</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It seems like every comic has a routine that deals with outrage culture. But when Michelle Wolf addresses it, you can be sure she is speaking from experience.
She opens her new Netflix stand-up special, “Joke Show,” with an observation. “Over the past couple of years,” she says, “we’ve developed this amazing ability to get mad at anyone for any reason.”
This is Wolf’s way of setting up a joke that leads her into the unpredictable minefield of comments on her Instagram feed. But as she said in a recent interview, her lesson about a culture that has become quick to anger is also a sly acknowledgment of all the tumult that’s recently transpired in her comedy career.
It was April 2018 when Wolf, an audacious if not yet widely known performer from “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” delivered a now-famous routine at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
Treating the event like a comedy roast, as past performers have, Wolf said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary at the time, “burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,” and said of CNN, “You guys love breaking news, and you did it, you broke it.”
Some viewers found it a hilarious exercise in speaking truth to power, but there was also swift and vocal condemnation of the routine from other constituencies. Wolf was disparaged by journalists, former White House officials and President Trump himself, who wrote in a tweet that she was “filthy” and that she had “totally bombed.” And the White House Correspondents’ Association said in a statement, “Unfortunately, the entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of that evening.”
The next month, Netflix introduced Wolf’s weekly topical comedy series, “The Break” — only to cancel the show that summer, providing more ammunition to the comedian’s detractors.
A year and a half later, Wolf is hardly chastened by these events. “Joke Show,” which Netflix will release Dec. 10, is not a direct response to her recent brush with notoriety but it is brimming with the same fierce candor that inspired it.
In this hourlong set, which only briefly addresses the correspondents’ dinner, Wolf dives headlong into topics that she expects will inflame some viewers, including her story about having an abortion.
With her newfound visibility, Wolf wants to show people who she really is as a stand-up: not a political comedian, but one who doesn’t mind being provocative to prove that she can find the humor in almost any subject.
“I say this all the time: Don’t bring your baggage into my joke,” Wolf told me. “A comic’s job isn’t to be right or wrong. They’re just supposed to be funny.”
On an afternoon in early November, Wolf, 34, was in Manhattan’s West Village, enjoying a breather from a barrage of stand-up dates that have lately taken her from Rochester, N.Y., to Sacramento, Calif.
She has only been working as a comedian for about a decade after leaving a career in finance. As in her act, the authentic Wolf has a wryness to her, but she also allows herself to take genuine pleasure in things. She said she enjoyed traveling widely and challenging the preconceptions of her audiences, whatever their political persuasions.
“It’s been making comedy really fun to do that,” she said with no evident sarcasm. “People have such strong beliefs, and you’re like, ‘All right, but — .’ That tension is perfect for comedy.”
If her scorched-earth approach to the correspondents’ dinner irritated so many of its attendees, Wolf wondered why she had been asked to address them in the first place.
“What did they think I was going to do?” she said. “I genuinely think they were like, ‘We’ll hire a woman, there’s no way this can go terribly — she’ll be soft.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, you hired the wrong woman.’”
Looking back on that set, Wolf said she had only one regret — “I would maybe go harder” — and felt that the firestorm of reaction had given her a new boldness. “It’s made me a lot less scared of opinions,” she said. “A lot of people hate me, and I’m alive. It’s fine.”
But she also said the controversy took some of her focus off “The Break,” a mix of stand-up and sketches, and that the show had suffered as a result. “It wasn’t the right time,” she said. “I don’t think I had a clear enough idea of what I really wanted to do.”
“The Break” is one of several attempts at topical comedy programming that Netflix has struggled with in its brief history. (A rare exception has been “Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj,” which has a more global perspective.)
Wolf said she sensed early on in the 10-episode run of her show that Netflix wouldn’t extend its order. “After the first two,” she said, “I was pretty sure they weren’t going to give us more, because we didn’t get any sort of pop.”
Still, the abrupt cancellation of “The Break” generated headlines — some of them arriving before Wolf could share the announcement with staff members — and seemed to leave the impression that Netflix was siding with critics of her correspondents’ dinner performance.
“It really gave people a lot of ammunition to be like, ‘Look at you, you’ll never work again,’” Wolf said. Even so, she said the end of the series was hardly a death sentence for her career. “A lot of great people have had shows canceled,” she said. “But also, so what? Now I just go back to doing stand-up? My favorite thing in the world? Too bad.”
Netflix declined to respond to Wolf’s comments on “The Break,” but Robbie Praw, the streaming service’s director of original stand-up comedy programming, said that he and his colleagues were committed to “making sure that our stand-up slate has the world’s most important voices and the world’s funniest people.” Wolf, he said, is “both of those things.”
He continued, “It’s not enough for her to be the funniest person in the room. It’s also important to her that every premise within that set is unbelievably unique. And then when it comes to putting a special together, you can be sure that every inch of material that she uses, she’s workshopped over 100 times. Every word, every inflection.”
Jared Freid, a friend and fellow comic who often opens for Wolf, said he had seen her become more energized and focused since she resumed touring.
Invoking Wolf’s passions for track and field and distance running, Freid said, “Michelle’s an athlete. I feel like that became motivating for her.”
Sam Morril, a stand-up comic who has known Wolf since the start of her career, said that Netflix had mistreated her in its handling of “The Break” and the show’s cancellation.
“She didn’t want to make a political show, and after the correspondents’ dinner, they completely kneecapped her with that,” said Morril, who did not work on the show.
Wolf, he said, has never been interested in being reaffirmed by any group that already shares her viewpoints and would much rather venture into unknown territory to win over skeptics.
“She’s become a folk hero to Burlington, Vt., and Portland, Ore., but she doesn’t want to be told that you’re my hero,” Morril said. “She wants to hear, ‘You’re so funny.’”
Wolf said she also wanted to feel that she could talk onstage about any of her opinions or experiences, no matter how potentially polarizing. That includes her abortion. In “Joke Show,” she says she believes women “should be able to get an abortion for any reason you want” and recounts how simple and uneventful the experience was for her.
As she says in the bit, “I left work. I got an abortion. I drank half a LaCroix and then I went back to work. Not a big deal and I also think a pretty good advertisement for LaCroix.”
Wolf told me that “as someone who is very, very much pro-choice,” she would have been a hypocrite if she hadn’t addressed this in her act.
“If I didn’t feel comfortable talking about it, and talking about it in such a casual way,” she said, “then I have no right to yell at people for disagreeing with me.”
She added that by sharing her own story, she hoped to make it easier for other women to do the same. “Women try to be very stoic and strong about it,” she said, “when we should talk about it and be very open, because it’s such a big part of life.”
Freid, who toured with Wolf as she worked on the set for “Joke Show,” said her abortion material was not recklessly provocative. “Whether you agree or disagree with anything she says, that bit was created with care while checking, in every part of the country, that it’ll get laughs,” he said.
And then, just at that moment in “Joke Show” when viewers might feel certain they have a handle on Wolf’s perspectives, she veers off into a routine in which she states that men are inherently stronger and faster than women, and how she expects to catch flak for saying this.
Wolf told me, “I think trying to make it seem like women are the same as men takes away from women. Stop trying to compare the two.” After a short pause, she chuckled and added, “Also, it’s just fun to make people a little mad.”
She can cite statistics that she says prove her point about the athletic superiority of men. Whether you accept her premise, it would seem a strange symptom of modern life that a comedian’s act must now be as thoroughly sourced and footnoted as a Wikipedia page.
Wolf said she actually enjoyed fact-checking her routine, awaiting the inevitable pushback from her audience and “arguing it like a legal case.”
“It’s fun to do, but I also make sure I have the logic and the facts to back me up,” she said. “Where you’re like, ‘You’re wrong about that’ and I’m like, ‘I’m actually very right.’ You might feel a certain way but I’m still correct.”
Not every routine has to be a political treatise or a term paper — it can also be an expression of pure silliness, and Wolf said she would like to get back to more of this type of comedy. “There’s plenty of jokes that are absurd and crazy and aren’t in the real world, and those are also really fun too,” she said.
“Hopefully I’ll get more and more confident and not feel like I need to back up all my jokes like that,” she said. “Just sometimes say something ridiculous and be like, well, if I’m wrong, I’m wrong.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A British man has been arrested after he allegedly went on a near two-mile wrecking spree with a stolen coach in Benidorm.
CCTV footage shows the coach smashing into mopeds and cars parked by the side of the road.
A police car was also damaged during the drama, which happened around 3.30am on Sunday morning.
The coach was driven at speed through the Spanish holiday resort after being taken from a depot where it had been left for the night.
The suspect is alleged to have accessed a room where the key was kept.
Do you know the British suspect? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.
Police sources confirmed the suspect is a British national.
One local said: “It was lucky there were few people around at that time of the night otherwise things could have turned out a lot worse.
“A lot of cars and motorbikes have been damaged but no-one fortunately has been hurt that I know of.”
The coach was taken from a car park near a sports centre known locally as the Palau d’Esports l’Illa on the outskirts of Benidorm.
It was driven towards the town centre and into a neighbourhood known as Els Tolls, even passing by the local police HQ at one point before being stopped in a road.
The exact number of vehicles damaged has yet to be disclosed.
The suspect has been handed over to the National Police force and is expected to appear in court later on Monday or Tuesday on suspicion of stealing a vehicle and road traffic offences.
He would have been breathalysed and made to take a drugs test, but the results of the tests have not been made public yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moment 'drunken' British tourist steals a coach in Benidorm and goes on a wild two-mile, high-speed wrecking spree</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A British tourist allegedly stole a coach in Benidorm before going on a two-mile, high-speed wrecking spree and smashing into cars and motorbikes.  
The vehicle was taken from a depot on the outskirts of the Spanish town where it had been left for the night before being driven at speed through the holiday resort.
The unnamed 27-year-old, believed to be a drunken tourist although officials have yet to comment, is said to have got into a room where the key was kept before making off with one of the vehicles.
Footage of his wild drive showed him smashing into mopeds and cars parked by the side of the road.
A police car was also damaged during the drama, which happened around 3.30am on Sunday morning.
Overnight reports citing local council sources pointed to the detainee possibly being a foreign tourist.
Police sources confirmed this morning he was a British national, although they offered no information on his age and what might have prompted his wrecking spree.
One local said: 'It was lucky there were few people around at that time of the night otherwise things could have turned out a lot worse.
'A lot of cars and motorbikes have been damaged but no-one fortunately has been hurt that I know of.'
The coach was taken from a car park near a sports centre known locally as the Palau d'Esports l'Illa on the outskirts of Benidorm.
It was driven towards the town centre and into a neighbourhood known as Els Tolls, even passing by the local police HQ at one point before being stopped in a road called Belgium Avenue which is Avenida de Belgica in Spanish.
Separate footage showed the coach on the kerb after it was brought to a stop surrounded by several police cars.
The witness who took the video said: 'There it is. I don't know if someone stole it. It was driven up three or four streets the wrong way.
'It was absolute madness. He's destroyed everything, a load of cars and this is where he has parked it. The side of the coach is really damaged.'
Another witness called Chris Garrido said: 'I saw it enter my street last night from my flat. I saw everything, how it smashed up mopeds in front of the police station and smashed a wing mirror and the back of a police van.
'It crashed into three cars at the start of the street and several mopeds and cars as well as metal bollards, and that was just in Grecia Street.
'I don't know if it was the normal driver of the vehicle and he was p***ed up or someone who was also p***ed up and had stolen it.'
Local Francisco Medina added on social media: 'Benidorm doesn't change.
'Us Spanish are being hit with taxes everywhere and the English do what they like and nothing happens.'  
The exact number of vehicles damaged has yet to be disclosed.
The suspect has been handed over to the National Police force and is expected to appear in court later today or tomorrow on suspicion of stealing a vehicle and road traffic offences.
He would have been breathalysed and made to take a drugs test, but the results of the tests have not been made public yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tourist tweets escape from New Zealand's White Island volcano</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Tourist Michael Schade stood at the crater of New Zealand’s White Island volcano minutes before it erupted on Monday and shared his terrifying experience in a series of messages and videos posted on social media.
“My God, White Island volcano in New Zealand erupted today for first time since 2001. My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it,” he tweeted.
“Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable.”
Several people were killed and injured and others were reported missing when the volcano erupted apparently without warning off the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island.
In video Schade posted on Twitter as he sped away from the island in a boat, a huge plume of white ash soars into the sky as a group of frightened tourists huddle close to the shore.
A helicopter parked nearby on the island looks crumpled and covered in ash.
“Those are some of the people (our) boat picked up. Praying for them and their recovery. Woman my mom tended to was in critical condition but seemed strong by the end,” Schade tweeted to his 2,570 followers.
“The helicopters on the island looked destroyed.”
Schade describes himself in his Twitter handle as someone who likes “helping people, photography, reading, gym, traveling, and learning new things”. He says he lives in San Francisco.
“This is so hard to believe. Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before,” he tweeted.
“My thoughts (are) with the families of those currently unaccounted for, the people recovering now, and especially the rescue workers.”
He also praised tour operators who helped tend to people in the minutes after the eruption.
“Endless gratitude to that crew for stepping up as first responders,” he wrote.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China says people held in Xinjiang camps have 'graduated', condemns U.S. bill</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING (Reuters) - People held in camps in China’s Xinjiang region have now “graduated” and new trainees will have the freedom to come and go, the regional governor said on Monday.
Governor Shohrat Zakir also hit out at Western criticism of the camps and said the United States had launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It describes the detainees as students.
“At present the trainees who have participated...have all graduated,” Zakir told a news conference in Beijing. “With the help of the government, stable employment has been achieved and their quality of life has been improved.”
Xinjiang will continue with training based on “independent will” and “the freedom to come and go”, he said.
China has not provided any official figures on how many people have been held in the camps but Zakhir said foreign estimates were “pure fabrication”. He gave no details.
He also called a measure passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that condemned China’s treatment of the Uighur minority a severe violation of international law and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs.
“The U.S. is getting restless and has launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang,” Zakir said. “But no force can stop Xinjiang’s progress toward stability and development.”
Claims about the camps are hard to verify as China only allows periodic supervised visits and gives little information on their operations.
In July, a Xinjiang official said most people had returned to society from the camps. Asked on Monday how many people had completed the training, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she could not give an exact number.
“Because the number of people participating in these training centers is dynamic, there’s coming and going, so it’s very difficult to give an exact number,” Hua told reporters at a separate briefing.
Human rights groups and former detainees have said conditions in the camps are poor, with inmates subject to psychological and physical abuse.
At Zakir’s news conference, images of past violence were displayed in excerpts from an English-language documentary, “Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang” aired on state broadcaster CGTN last week.
Hua expressed disappointment at the lack of foreign media coverage of the documentary despite the intense concern over the Xinjiang issue.
She said there had been no terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years due to the success of the camps.
The U.S. Uighur Act passed by the House of Representatives last week requires the U.S. president to condemn abuses against Muslims and calls for the closure of the camps in Xinjiang.
It also calls on President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on a member of China’s powerful politburo, Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo.
The issue, along with Washington’s support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, complicates prospects for a near-term deal to end a 17-month long trade war between China and the United States.

WADA’s executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Japan PM Abe discussing Japan visit by Iranian President Rouhani</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that Tokyo is in discussions about a visit to Japan by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this month, an attempt to try to resolve Iran’s nuclear impasse with the United States.
He also said Japan wants to make every possible effort to promote Middle East peace.
Japan maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran, and has tried to ease tension between the countries, which broke off diplomatic relations after Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution.
Citing a senior diplomatic source, Kyodo news agency reported last week that Iran had proposed the visit and that the proposal was relayed during a two-day visit to Japan by Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs Abbas Araqchi.
Abe said Japan would make every effort to promote peace in the Middle East but did not specify when there might be a decision on sending Japanese seamen to the region to guard ships supplying Japan.
“As one of those efforts, we are currently in talks about a visit by President Rouhani to Japan,” he added.
Abe did not give details but local media reported the visit could take place on Dec. 20 or 21.
The Nikkei business daily said last week the government would propose deploying one escort ship and a patrol aircraft from the Maritime Self-Defense Force on a one-year mission that could be renewed annually. It plans to finalize the plan by year-end, the Nikkei said.
Abe visited Iran in July and met with Rouhani and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during which Khamenei reiterated Iran’s stance that it has no intention of making or using nuclear weapons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian forces enter former Islamic State stronghold in Syria after U.S. pullback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian forces have entered Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the Islamic State caliphate, in one of the starkest examples yet of how Moscow has filled the vacuum created by President Donald Trump’s decision to pull U.S. forces from northern Syria.
Russian troops were shown in footage on the defense ministry’s Zvezda TV channel shaking hands with Syrian children and unloading humanitarian aid bundles with the slogan “Russia is with you” from the back of trucks.
Raqqa was captured two years ago by U.S. troops and their Kurdish-led Syrian allies in the biggest victory of Washington’s campaign against Islamic State in Syria. But since Trump abruptly ordered a pull-out in October, Moscow has swiftly advanced into territory where U.S. troops had operated.
Russia is a close battlefield ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, which was invited by the Kurds into territory they controlled after Trump pulled his forces out of the way of a Turkish assault against Kurdish-held areas.
Russian troops in Raqqa were handing out humanitarian aid and its military doctors were offering residents medical attention, Vladimir Varnavsky, a defense ministry officer, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.
“Work in the city to get rid of the rubble and clear the area (of bombs or mines) is not yet complete and there is a shortage of clean water, medicine and food,” he said.
Russia last month set up a helicopter base an airport in a northeastern Syrian city and also landed forces at a sprawling air base in the region that had been vacated by U.S. forces.
Russia and Turkey are carrying out joint patrols along Syria’s northern border with Turkey as part of a deal struck between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan.
After saying all U.S. troops would leave northern Syria, Washington has left some behind for now at some bases but rolled back most of their operations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey says it has deported 11 French terrorist suspects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday it had deported 11 French nationals back to France as part of a program to extradite what it says are foreign terrorist fighters.
Turkey’s Interior Ministry, which made the announcement, gave no details. France’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment, but diplomatic sources said the 11 included four women and seven children.
Turkey is holding hundreds of Islamic State suspects and last month launched a program to repatriate detainees that has caused friction with its NATO allies.
Ankara has accused European countries of being too slow to take back citizens who traveled to the Middle East to fight.
Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said in November that Ankara would repatriate most detainees with suspected links to Islamic State by the end of this year.
The move is forcing European governments to decide how to handle the return of radicalized militants, including those with battlefield experience.
Paris signed an agreement with Ankara five years ago for French nationals arrested by Turkish authorities to be deported in coordination with the French authorities. Turkey has expelled almost 300 French nationals since then, French officials say.
France’s Center for Analysis of Terrorism said one of the newly deported women was Amandine Le Coz, who had been married to a Moroccan militant killed in Syria. She joined Islamic State with her husband in 2014.
It said another was Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old French national who lived in Britain before joining Islamic State in 2015 and who recruited several teenage women. Gondal is banned from re-entering Britain.
France’s foreign ministry and interior ministry declined to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This was supposed to be the climate crisis election. So what happened?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The public want action, but with the Tories obsessed with Brexit, the issue hasn’t gained traction in the media
The moment I began to lose hope that this really would be “the climate election” came the day after Channel 4 hosted its climate debate. For the first time in British history, party leaders had gathered to discuss how to tackle the climate crisis. Yet the papers and morning TV and radio shows didn’t seem particularly interested in the discussion: they spent more time talking about Michael Gove and Stanley Johnson’s Borat-esque attempt to storm the doors with a camera crew.
It’s useless to waste energy blaming Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, for this. There is a term used in basketball to explain the behaviour of an incorrigible gunner who hoists a shot at every opportunity: shooters shoot. It’s just their nature. Gove goves, meaning if you trot him out, he does personally and professionally debasing things in front of television cameras to lock down their attention.
Besides, this isn’t just about the media’s weakness for the stuntmen of British politics – Boris Johnson, Gove and Nigel Farage chief among them. It’s part of a larger failure to seriously report on or analyse climate policy during this election campaign. It is, admittedly, difficult to cover the climate crisis: no journalist or organisation has yet nailed the perfect balance of scientific perspective and personal connection, of apocalyptic warning and hope.
But the situation in this election seems particularly straightforward. There is a public galvanised by a year of popular protest, who consistently say that they care deeply about the climate crisis and want it addressed – that it will influence their vote. There are also multiple political parties that have committed to bold, transformative climate policies, but with markedly different approaches. If only there were some institution in public life to bridge that gap, to mediate that conversation.
So far, it hasn’t happened. There has been a steady drip-feed of straight reporting of the parties’ policies, and the Channel 4 climate debate was a big step forward. But across the media landscape there is remarkable resistance to having a serious discussion about climate politics and how far they’ve come. The incredible scale of the proposals makes this especially baffling. Just on the plain numbers, Labour has committed to £250bn in public spending to fight the climate crisis, the Liberal Democrats to £100bn, and the Greens £1tn. To give a sense of scale, the Iraq war cost the UK £9.6bn, the war in Afghanistan £20.6bn and bank bailouts between 2008 and 2011 cost the UK taxpayer £124bn. I believe all of those things were widely talked about.
In the policies themselves, there are commitments to epochal, systemic changes that would transform the landscape of this country and the daily lives of its inhabitants. Labour’s green new deal would shift nearly a million workers into new industries and slate nearly every home in the UK for refurbishment. The Lib Dems have broached the possibility of a flight tax to reduce aviation emissions, something no other country has yet instituted. Yet despite the novelty and scale of the proposals, the British media has shown frustratingly little curiosity in analysing or unpacking them. This isn’t really so surprising. The media has come in for plenty of criticism in this election cycle, and much of that criticism applies equally to its climate reporting. There is a deep conservatism in the British press that tends towards dismissing or resisting potential changes to the current order – and in most cases, avoids discussing them at all. It is as if it lacks the theory or the language to do so.
There are established narratives about the issues, about politicians and about the electorate that can’t be dislodged. The recent tectonic shift in public opinion and political will on climate over the past year can join the polarisation of the electorate, the “Faragisation” of the Conservative party, and even the longrunning and obvious push to privatise the NHS, as issues the media seems incapable of grappling with.
And then there is the fact that climate reporting has always proceeded on a separate track, in a silo apart from mainstream concerns. Facts are reported, but in discussion and analysis, there is a pervasive sense that things aren’t about to change – despite all evidence to the contrary. We are told by scientists, activists, and now by the majority of our politicians that we face perhaps the greatest crisis in human history, and that immense upheaval is coming. For all the impact this has made on the coverage of this campaign, you’d think it was happening on another planet.
When this contest was called journalists initially asked if it would be the “climate election”. They then failed to live up to their own promise. The climate crisis is already part of the election – it’s time the media treated it that way.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">• Brighton confirm arrests during 2-2 draw on Sunday• ‘We simply won’t stand for it at the Amex’
Brighton have announced that two visiting supporters were arrested on suspicion of homophobic abuse during Sunday’s match with Wolves at the Amex Stadium.
Two men, aged 46 and 48 from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, were ejected from the away section during the 2-2 draw and later arrested by Sussex Police outside the ground. They have since been released pending investigation.
The incident was one of several cases of alleged homophobic abuse at top-flight matches during a week in which the Premier League has backed Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport.
Brighton’s chief executive and deputy chairman, Paul Barber, told the club’s official website: “It’s both sad and depressing that once again we find ourselves having to address another situation of discriminatory abuse. Prior to kick-off, we had a huge show of support for the Rainbow Laces campaign brilliantly backed by the vast majority of people inside the stadium, and yet before the game is over, we are forced to deal with these two individuals, who think it’s OK to behave in this way.
“Working with Sussex Police, I’m pleased to report that once again our staff were able to take swift action, which hopefully will increase the chances of a conviction. We simply won’t stand for it at the Amex. Once again, it’s very hard to comprehend why some individuals think it’s acceptable to behave in this way, but we are very clear that neither Brighton and Hove Albion, nor the wider football community, will tolerate homophobia or discrimination at any time, in any form. We would urge any fans confronted with similar discriminatory behaviour to report it immediately, either directly to a steward or via our anonymous hotline, and we will take strong action.”
Wolves have confirmed they will be supporting Sussex Police’s investigation into the incident and say they strongly condemn any form of discrimination.
A club statement said: “Wolves can confirm that there were two arrests for homophobic abuse at yesterday’s game against Brighton and Hove Albion. There is no room in football or society for discrimination of any kind, and the club strongly condemns such behaviour.
“Our ethos at Wolves is about being ‘One Pack’ – an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch. The club is now offering its support to Sussex Police in what is a criminal investigation.”
A Sussex Police statement said: “Two football fans were arrested following reports of homophobic gestures made at the Amex Stadium on Sunday 8 December. The suspects – both away fans during Brighton and Hove Albion’s match against Wolverhampton Wanderers – were identified by club stewards and arrested on suspicion of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
“The two men – aged 46 and 48, and both from Bridgnorth in Shropshire – have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.”
Monday’s announcements from Brighton and Wolves come after Everton launched an investigation on Sunday into reports of homophobic chanting aimed at Chelsea fans during the Toffees’ 3-1 victory at Goodison Park on Saturday. Also on Sunday, a 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence following Saturday’s Manchester derby between City and United at the Etihad Stadium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NSW fires: state faces 'lethal' conditions as temperatures forecast to soar past 40C</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RFS commissioner says despite lower wind speed on Tuesday, high temperature and low humidity will make it a ‘difficult day’ with the New South Wales bushfires
NSW is facing a potentially “lethal” cocktail of bushfire conditions with smoke pollution set to smother Sydney and temperatures to soar past 40C.
The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says wind speeds won’t be as high as previous dangerous days, but this will be cancelled out by high temperatures and low humidity.
“It’s not as bad as the catastrophic weather we had weeks ago, but it’s certainly going to be another difficult day, particularly given the scale and complexity of these fires and their proximity to so much more built up and populated areas,” he told reporters on Monday.
“We’ve got fires effectively stretching now from the Queensland border right down to our far south coast area.”
Fitzsimmons said his firefighting crews were beginning to feel the pinch amid an unprecedented NSW bushfire season in which six lives and more than 680 homes have been lost.
“They’ve been flogged now for months, particularly up in the north ... and [with] the fire activity extending further south, we’re literally rotating through thousands of people every day, every week,” he said.
Crews are working on a so-called mega-fire north-west of Sydney, which was formed when the huge Gospers Mountain blaze merged with the neighbouring Little L Complex, Paddock Run, Three Mile and Kerry Ridge fires.
The RFS says the mega-fire will continue to burn until it is doused with rain.
“[Tuesday] is a very dangerous day for NSW given the combination of very hot, windy conditions and that has been lethal in the last few months,” the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said.
“We know, given the horror summer we’re likely to have with hot, dry, drought conditions, everybody doing their bit is important.”
The NSW Health environmental health director, Dr Richard Broome, said Tuesday is likely to be “very hot and very smoky”.
“It’s going to be putting a lot of stress on vulnerable people, particularly elderly people who have existing heat and lung conditions.”
The NSW environment department says air quality will be poor in Sydney on Tuesday and could “cause symptoms, especially with people with heart or lung disease”.
Weather bureau state manager Jane Golding says temperatures could be higher than 40C in greater Sydney, the Hunter, the Illawarra and northern parts of the state.
There were almost 90 fires burning across NSW on Monday evening with 39 of those out of control.
The RFS is forecasting a “severe” fire danger for Greater Sydney, Illawarra-Shoalhaven, the Greater Hunter, the ACT and the southern and central ranges on Tuesday.
Total fire bans are in place for each of these regions, as well as the Monaro, the southern slopes, the eastern Riverina, and the north-western parts of the state.
The NSW Police deputy commissioner, Gary Worboys, reminded the public not to leave children or pets unattended in vehicles.
“Not only is it dangerous, it can be deadly,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2019 general election campaign is in full swing, and polling day is drawing closer. The deadline to apply for postal votes and proxy votes has now passed.
So if you are already registered for either a postal or proxy vote in this year's general election, read on to make sure your vote gets counted.
In England, Scotland and Wales, you can choose to vote by post if you cannot or do not wish to attend your polling station in person.  Different arrangements for postal voting apply in Northern Ireland. See here for further details.
No - the deadline in England, Scotland and Wales was 11.59pm on Nov 26. If you did not apply before this deadline, you won't be able to vote by post. 
There’s a different form to apply to vote by post or proxy in Northern Ireland. The deadline to register for a postal vote in Northern Ireland was 21 Nov. You can still apply for a temporary postal or proxy vote on the grounds of unforeseen circumstances related to health - head here for more information.
If you have registered to vote by post, your postal vote must arrive at your Electoral Office in the UK by 10pm on Dec 12, the day of the election. 
If you're unable to post your voting pack in time, you can take it to your local polling station on polling day by 10pm, or to your local Electoral Registration Office before they close.
Complete your ballot paper in secret, then put it in the envelope supplied and seal it tight.  
You must also remember to fill in and sign the accompanying postal voting statement.
Put both items into the larger envelope and post it back to your local electoral registration office. 
Yes. A postal vote can be sent to your home address, or any other address you provide. You just need to remember to allow enough time for it to be returned so it arrives back by 10pm on polling day otherwise your vote won't be counted.
If you're posting your vote from overseas you'll need to pay for postage. Otherwise there's a Freepost envelope provided for returns within the UK.
If you’re unable to vote in person you can ask someone to vote on your behalf. This is called a proxy vote.
You can only apply for a proxy vote under certain circumstances, including:
The deadline to apply for a proxy vote in this year's general election was 5pm on Dec 4. The deadline has now passed.
If you have an emergency that means you cannot vote in person, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote. This must be something you were not aware of before Dec 4. 
You can find more information about emergency proxy votes here.
You can ask anyone to act as your proxy - as long as they:
If they cannot get to your polling station, they will need to contact your local electoral registration office to arrange to cast their proxy vote by post.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to vote in the 2019 general election </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are two weeks left until the 2019 general election polling day. Here is everything you need to know about how to vote on Dec 12.
The general election is on Dec 12 2019. The votes will choose a total of 650 people to become members of Parliament (MPs), who will decide how to proceed with Brexit.
Usually general elections are held every five years, but this will be the third since 2015. 
Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, so long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. 
No - the deadline to register to vote was midnight on Tuesday Nov 26.  Anyone who missed this deadline will not be able to vote in this year's general election.
The deadline to apply to vote by post was also on Nov 26. If you are registered to vote by post, your postal vote must arrive at your Electoral Office in the UK by 10pm on Dec 12, the day of the election.
If you’re already registered to vote but unable to vote in person, there is still time to apply to vote by proxy. This means someone will vote on your behalf. You need to apply by 5pm on Dec 4 to vote by proxy in the general election in England, Scotland or Wales.
You can find more information on postal votes and proxy votes here.
To see who is standing in your part of the country, visit the Who Can I Vote For? website.

Still unsure who to vote for? If you're thinking of voting tactically to get your preferred Brexit outcome, try our tactical voting guide to get our recommendation on whether voting tactically could actually affect your seat. 
You will receive a polling card before the election telling you where to vote. It will be a local polling station, set up in places such as school halls or churches. You can only vote at the polling station location on your card.
When you arrive at the polling station, give your name and address to the staff members inside. They will give you a ballot paper to select your candidate on. Fold the ballot paper in half and put it in the ballot box after making your choice. 
The polling card is for your information only - you do not need to take it to the polling station and you can still vote if you have misplaced it. 
Polling booths will be open between 7am and 10pm on election day - 12 December. Counting of votes will begin when the polls close. 
If medical reasons or your occupation, service or employment means that you cannot go to the polling station, you can apply to vote by emergency proxy up until 5pm on polling day.
If you already know that you will not be able to make it to your polling station on 12 December, you can apply for a postal vote or register for a proxy vote in advance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">London Bridge terror attack: Ex-convict sprayed fire extinguisher into Usman Khan's eyes so that man with narwhal tusk could stab him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former convict who tackled the London Bridge terrorist has revealed how he used a fire extinguisher in an attempt to blind Usman Khan so that a man wielding a narwahl tusk could stab him. 
John Crilly, who served 13 years in prison for murder before his sentence was quashed, was one of a group of people to take down Khan, who killed two people on November 29. 
Mr Crilly, 48, was convicted of murdering 71-year-old Augustine Maduemezia, but his conviction was rescinded after a Supreme Court ruling on joint enterprise law and he was released in 2018.
The court ruled the law on joint enterprise - where defendants were prosecuted for murder even if they did not strike the fatal blow - had been misinterpreted.
He told the Daily Mirror that he used the foam from a fire extinguisher he picked up at Fishmongers Hall as a weapon against Khan, who was wearing a hoax suicide belt.
"At first, I thought throw that at him, then I thought I could spray it and soak the belt, maybe short-circuit the belt," he said.
"I started spraying him and it seemed to do the job. I was spraying it in his eyes...he can’t see and that gives the whale guy a chance to give him a poke." 
Video footage from the terror attack shows a bystander holding a narwhal tusk, which had been ripped from a wall inside Fishmongers Hall where Khan, Mr Crilly and others were taking part in a prisoner rehabilitation conference. 
This is where Khan started his rampage, and Mr Crilly has shed light on the details of what happened inside the venue before the terrorist was chased out onto the street where he was shot dead by police. 
He told the Daily Mirror: "At the bottom of the stairs stood Usman Khan with his two knives out jumping about like a mad man. It didn’t take too long to realise what was going on.
"Without stereotyping, he had a big beard, two knives, shouting ‘Allahu akbar’. He was wearing a suicide belt."
Mr Crilly also said that an armed Khan told them: "I'm going to kill you all," before lunging at crowds with his knives.
Talking about the burglary in Manchester that went wrong and ended with one of his co-defendants killing a pensioner with a single punch, he said: "My life has been spent wishing that day never happened."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Yoko Ono describes 'hollowing experience' of losing John Lennon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday (8 December) marked the 39th anniversary of the death of John Lennon, with family, friends and fans all paying fresh tribute to the late Beatle.
Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono posted an emotional tribute to the musician on Twitter in which she described the process of losing a loved one as ‘a hollowing experience’.
‘After 39 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him,’ Yoko wrote, referencing Lennon’s two sons before quoting one of the most famous lyrics from Imagine: ‘Imagine all the people, living life in peace.’
Yoko also took a renewed stand against gun violence in the US, pulling up a statistic which claimed that over 1.4 million people have been killed a a result of gun violence in the US since Lennon’s murder in New York in December 1980.
‘Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed with guns,’ she wrote. ‘We are turning this beautiful country into a War Zone.
‘Together, let’s bring back America, the green land of Peace.’
Six hours on from her original post, Yoko heartbreakingly added: ‘It is always good to cry. Tears gives you immense health.’
Last month, Lennon’s Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr recalled being told the devastating news of Lennon’s murder, admitting that he ‘still well[s] up that some b*****d shot him’.
‘We got a plane to New York, and you don’t know what you can do,’ the drummer said about what he did in the immediate aftermath of Lennon’s death.
‘We went to the apartment. “Anything we can do?” And Yoko just said, “Well, you just play with Sean. Keep Sean busy.” And that’s what we did.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">John Lennon’s wife Yoko Ono has marked the 39th anniversary of the Beatles legend death by revealing she still feels “hollow” and misses him daily.
Lennon was shot outside the couple’s Dakota Building apartment in New York on December 8, 1980, and Ono says she and his sons still struggle with the untimely death of their beloved husband and father, reports aceshowbiz.com.
“After 39 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him. The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience,” she wrote on Twitter.
She went on to call on American politicians to change US gun laws, adding: “Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed with guns. We are turning this beautiful country into a War Zone. Together, let’s bring back America, the green land of peace.”
She also shared a statistic that said over 1,400,000 people have been killed by guns in America since Lennon’s death.

    <h5 class="mb-1">North Korea calls Trump ‘erratic old man’ after tweets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The comments came after Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un would not want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders.
North Korea has insulted US President Donald Trump, calling him a “heedless and erratic old man”.
The insult comes after Mr Trump tweeted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would not want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders and affect the American presidential election by resuming hostile acts.
A senior North Korean official, former nuclear negotiator Kim Yong Chol, said that his country would not cave in to US pressure because it has nothing to lose and accused the Trump administration of attempting to buy time ahead of an end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un for Washington to salvage nuclear talks.
On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted: “Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way … North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearise as promised.”
He was referring to a vague statement issued by the two leaders during their first summit in Singapore in June last year that called for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when or how it would occur.
Mr Trump added that Mr Kim “does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November.”
Kim Yong Chol said Mr Trump’s tweets clearly show that he is an irritated old man “bereft of patience”.
“As (Trump) is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we cannot but call him a ‘dotard’ again may come,” Kim Yong Chol said.
“Trump has too many things that he does not know about (North Korea). We have nothing more to lose. Though the US may take away anything more from us, it can never remove the strong sense of self-respect, might and resentment against the U.S. from us.”
Kim Yong Chol travelled to Washington and met with the US president twice last year while setting up the summits with Kim Jong Un.
The latest war of words came as diplomats said the US had changed its mind and is now refusing to sign a letter that would have authorised the UN Security Council to hold a meeting on the human rights situation in North Korea.
Without support from Washington, the diplomats said European and other supporters of holding a meeting cannot go ahead because they are one vote short of the minimum nine “yes” votes required.
Nuclear negotiations faltered after a February meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim in Vietnam broke down when the US side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.
Mr Kim has said North Korea will seek a “new way” if the US maintains its sanctions and pressure, and issued the deadline for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim met for a third time in June at the border between the two Koreas and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude”.

“Trump has too many things that he does not know about (North Korea). We have nothing more to lose. Though the US may take away anything more from us, it can never remove the strong sense of self-respect, might and resentment against the U.S. from us.”
Kim Yong Chol travelled to Washington and met with the US president twice last year while setting up the summits with Kim Jong Un.
The latest war of words came as diplomats said the US had changed its mind and is now refusing to sign a letter that would have authorised the UN Security Council to hold a meeting on the human rights situation in North Korea.
Without support from Washington, the diplomats said European and other supporters of holding a meeting cannot go ahead because they are one vote short of the minimum nine “yes” votes required.
Nuclear negotiations faltered after a February meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim in Vietnam broke down when the US side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.
Mr Kim has said North Korea will seek a “new way” if the US maintains its sanctions and pressure, and issued the deadline for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim met for a third time in June at the border between the two Koreas and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">North Korea calls Trump ‘erratic old man’ after tweets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">North Korea has insulted US President Donald Trump, calling him a “heedless and erratic old man”.
The insult comes after Mr Trump tweeted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would not want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders and affect the American presidential election by resuming hostile acts.
A senior North Korean official, former nuclear negotiator Kim Yong Chol, said that his country would not cave in to US pressure because it has nothing to lose and accused the Trump administration of attempting to buy time ahead of an end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un for Washington to salvage nuclear talks.
On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted: “Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way … North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearise as promised.”
He was referring to a vague statement issued by the two leaders during their first summit in Singapore in June last year that called for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when or how it would occur.
Mr Trump added that Mr Kim “does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November.”
Kim Yong Chol said Mr Trump’s tweets clearly show that he is an irritated old man “bereft of patience”.
“As (Trump) is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we cannot but call him a ‘dotard’ again may come,” Kim Yong Chol said.
“Trump has too many things that he does not know about (North Korea). We have nothing more to lose. Though the US may take away anything more from us, it can never remove the strong sense of self-respect, might and resentment against the U.S. from us.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">North Korea insulted US President Donald Trump again on Monday, calling him a thoughtless and sneaky old man after he tweeted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wouldn't want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders and affect the American presidential election by resuming hostile acts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson is an enemy to football and Gary Neville did not go far enough when condemning prime minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville did not go far enough. The Tories are the enemies of football. If Boris Johnson is given a working majority in Parliament on Thursday in the General Election, stadiums across the country will become more toxic. Neville pointed the finger at the Prime Minister after Fred, the Manchester United midfielder, was allegedly racially abused by a Manchester City fan at the Etihad on Saturday night. It was brave and necessary criticism from the former United full back. Johnson has a long history of making racist comments. It is hard to imagine how a man who wrote “tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles” came to lead a multicultural nation. He uses the language of the 19th century - not the 21st.
Yet over the past three years, since he got a sniff of Downing Street, the old Etonian has in my opinion upped the ante. Johnson appears to have deliberately sought to appeal to some of the worst characteristics of British culture. The 41-year-old man who was arrested after appearing to gesticulate in an offensive manner at the Manchester derbyappears to be precisely Johnson’s target market. Hell, if the Prime Minister can refer to black people as “piccaninnies,” what’s wrong with a monkey gesture? To me, it feels as though Johnson and his ‘bad boys of Brexit’ cronies have legitimised casual hate in a way that seemed unthinkable a decade ago.
It was sickening to see John Barnes in the company of the Conservative leader on Saturday at the Seashell Trust in Cheadle. Johnson was there to publicise the manifesto pledge to bring the World Cup to the UK and Ireland in 2030 and the promise to put £550 million into the grassroots game. Barnes, who ran the gauntlet of racist thugs throughout his playing career, has always taken a somewhat idiosyncratic approach to confronting bigotry. In normal circumstances it would have been a welcome development to see someone of Barnes’s experience meet the Prime Minister to explain what black players and people suffer on a daily basis. In the midst of an election campaign, however, it seemed like an endorsement. Just stand there for the photo op, John, and dazzle the cameras with that smile. My stomach turned watching it.
The former Watford and Liverpool winger was at his peak when a Tory government showed the most naked contempt for football and its fans. Margaret Thatcher, the demented patron saint of brutish Conservativism, hated the game. Under her regime in the 1980s, supporters were demonised and criminalised. How bad was it? After the Bradford Fire where 56 people died in a decrepit tinderbox of a stand at Valley Parade in 1985, The Sunday Times opined that football was “a slum sport played in slum stadiums increasingly watched by slum people, who deter decent folk from turning up.” This was not a reaction to hooliganism. It was a response to the deaths of innocent people in a completely avoidable inferno.
It is an accurate reflection of how Thatcherite acolytes viewed the game. Football was a working-class pursuit and one of the themes of the 80s was the assault on working-class culture. Supporters were part of Thatcher’s “enemy within,” to be monitored with identity cards and policed with a presumption that they were inclined to violence. These thought processes led to Hillsborough and allowed those in authority responsible for the 1989 disaster to believe that they could avoid any accountability for their behaviour. It turned out that they were right and there were no consequences for those who caused the deaths of 96 people.
Thatcher’s most famous assertion was “there is no society.” Her disciples claim the statement does not quite mean what it says. You have to understand the context, they claim. Well that’s nonsense. The so-called Iron Lady believed that individuals only had responsibility to themselves and their family. That in part explained why she could not understand football and why she feared it. Clubs grew out of churches, factories and workers’ associations and, even now, the sport remains underpinned by community spirit. It proves there is society
Johnson appears to have inherited Thatcher’s disdain for the game and her suspicion of civic togetherness. The evidence is clear in the infamous Spectator leader published during his editorship in 2004 after the murder of Kenneth Bigley by Jihadis in Iraq. The article talked of “tribal grievances.” We have already seen Johnson use the word “tribal” to imply that Africans are uncivilised. Now it was applied to football fans. The next paragraph expanded the thought. It said: “The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon.”
Johnson did not write this editorial – it is not uncommon for columnists to get someone else to pen their copy for them – but I believe it accurately reflected his views. The belief that the lower orders are predisposed to dangerous, alcohol-fuelled madness when they go the match is deeply ingrained in the Conservative psyche. It lingers today. And it was never just about Liverpool. The likes of Johnson hold their noses whenever they come across football supporters, no matter which part of the country the fans are from.
There are bigger issues at play in this crucial election – the future of the National Health Service, peace in Ireland, Britain’s relationship with Europe – but make no mistake: if Johnson wins, it is my belief that the experience of watching football live will deteriorate.
Racists and bigots will be empowered. Instead of accepting culpability for creating an environment where obscene attitudes thrive, Johnson and those around him will look down their noses at the perpetrators and attribute uncivilised behaviour to the unspeakable lower classes.
The mood of the game reflects the health of the country. Too many incidents over the past few years have shown a racist poison is growing stronger in the stands. Neville is correct to call the Prime Minister to account. The state is sick and in my view electing Johnson will make the illness even more vile. The nation deserves better – and so does football.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologises for Christmas jumper 'showing Santa doing cocaine'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Walmart Canada has issued an apology for selling a jumper on its site that appears to show Santa Claus doing cocaine.
The item of clothing shows Saint Nicholas sitting behind a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him, captioned with the slogan: “Let it snow.”
The product’s description on the Walmart Canada website stated: “We all know how snow works. It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.
“That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.”
A spokesperson for Walmart has apologised for the sale of the product, adding that it has been removed from the company’s Canadian website.
 
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” the spokesperson told Global News.
“We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.”
The jumper was produced by clothing retailer Fun Wear.
Other items created by Fun Wear that are still available to purchase on Walmart’s Canadian site include a jumper depicting a mugshot of Santa Claus, a sweatshirt featuring an illustration of Santa engaged in a fight with a bear and a Chanukah sweatshirt designed with a menorah and captioned with the slogan: “Lit.”
Other items of clothing, including a sweatshirt that showed Father Christmas standing in front of a fireplace without his trousers on, have been removed from the Walmart Canada website.
A range of Christmas cards featuring the Virgin Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus recently sparked anger among members of the Christian community, who described them as “deeply offensive”.
One of the cards includes the caption: “Mary just needs to admit she slept with someone else.”
“It highlights a fundamental hypocrisy that Christianity is seen as fair game to mock, disparage and insult,” said James Mildred, communication manager of Christian Action Research and Education (CARE).
The Independent has contacted Walmart for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Government moves further changes to Arms (Amendment) Bill</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday moved further amendments to the Arms (Amendment) Bill including provision of special status to sportspersons.
"There were many discrepancies in the six-decade old law making crime control difficult," he said while introducing further amendments in Lok Sabha.
The further amendment to the Bill seeks to provide special status for sportspersons.
"Many suggestions were received. I have moved an official amendment in this regard also," he said.
The Bill was tabled in Lok Sabha on November 29. The Bill seeks to enhance punishment for illegally possessing and making prohibited arms besides other changes in the six- decade-old Arms Act.
The Arms (Amendment) Bill makes provision that a person can have a maximum of two firearms, as against the present norm of three.
Those who own more than two firearms will have to deposit the third one with authorities or authorised gun dealers within 90 days for de-licensing once the amendment is approved by Parliament, according to the bill.
As per the bill, the government proposes to amend Section 25 (1AA) of the Arms Act, 1959, to give punishment from the usual life term of 14 years to "imprisonment for the remainder of that person's life" for manufacturing, selling, repairing and possessing "prohibited" arms.
The minimum punishment under this section will be 14 years.
Under the present law, the offence invites imprisonment not be less than seven years but may extend to life imprisonment - mostly up to 14 years.
According to an estimate, India has around 35 lakh gun licences. Thirteen lakh people have licences to carry weapons in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Jammu and Kashmir, where 3.7 lakh people possess arms licences, most of which were taken in the name of personal security.
Punjab, which witnessed terrorism in 1980s and 1990s, has around 3.6 lakh active gun licences, most of which were issued during the two decades wherein militancy had engulfed the state.

The minimum punishment under this section will be 14 years. Under the present law, the offence may invite imprisonment not less than seven years but which may extend to life imprisonment, mostly up to 14 years.
According to an estimate, India has around 35 lakh gun licences. Thirteen lakh people have licences to carry weapons in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Jammu and Kashmir, where 3.7 lakh people possess arms licence, mostly taken for the reason of personal security. Punjab, which witnessed terrorism in 1980s and 1990s, has around 3.6 lakh active gun licences.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Torrential rains in Uganda, 26 killed, says Red Cross</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) - At least 26 people have been killed in floods unleashed by heavy rains in different parts of Uganda, the Red Cross said on Monday as authorities urged people in affected areas to relocate.
Seventeen flooding deaths have been confirmed in the western district of Bundibugyo. Another nine people have died in the mountainous districts of Sironko and Bududa in the east, where residents also face mudslides that can destroy entire enclaves, said Irene Nakasiita, a spokeswoman for the Uganda Red Cross.
Ugandan government officials have acknowledged the continuing threat from flooding and say relief is forthcoming to affected areas. Residents are being urged to move away from areas where rivers and streams have burst their banks.
More than 6,000 people have been displaced in Bududa, a rugged area in the foothills of Mount Elgon where mudslides have killed hundreds of people over the years. Some there have resisted the government's attempts to have them relocated to lowlands elsewhere, saying they find it hard to vacate their ancestral lands.
"The risk of more flooding and landslides is real," Musa Ecweru, the government minister in charge of disasters, said in a statement Thursday.
Hundreds of acres of plantations have been destroyed and an unknown number of livestock lost in the flooding and mudslides in Bududa and Sironko, Ecweru said.
In March 2010 at least 100 people died in mudslides in Bududa, and injuries or deaths have been reported every year since then during the wet season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Study finds broadcast coverage of the UK election has aligned 'most closely' with Boris Johnson's agenda</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC and other UK broadcasters have helped Boris Johnson frame the general election on his own terms, according to an academic study of media coverage of the campaign.
The prime minister’s campaign has sought to focus the upcoming general election on the issue of “getting Brexit done” under his leadership.
Now a new study by Loughborough University suggests that broadcasters have helped him in this aim.
The researchers found that “TV coverage has focused far more on Brexit than on any other issue,” with 20% of broadcast coverage of the election focused on this theme.
This contrasts with just 8% of broadcast coverage focusing on the opposition Labour party’s central issue of the future of the National Health Service.
The authors found that “in proportional terms, TV coverage has therefore tended to align most closely with the Conservatives’ Brexit agenda.”
The study also found that the print media was overwhelmingly biased against the Labour party.
Examination of print media coverage in the first four weeks of the campaign found that Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party received broadly positive coverage, whereas Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign was portrayed in an overwhelmingly negative light.
Under UK broadcasting regulations, television and radio channels must give equal coverage to each party during a general election campaign.
However, a complaint by Labour last month about Sky News channel running its election coverage with the branding “The Brexit Election was rejected by the broadcasting regulators.
In their ruling Ofcom said that Brexit was an “important background contextual factor” in the election.
A Survation poll for ITV on Monday found that Johnson’s party had opened up a 14-point lead over Labour. The Conservatives are on 45% ahead of Labour on 31% and the Liberal Democrats on 11%.
If repeated at the general election on Thursday, this would result in a large parliamentary majority for the Conservatives.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Conservatives have held onto their significant 10-point lead over Labour with just three days to go until Britain heads to the polls.
As the campaign enters its final few days Boris Johnson is attempting to sway voters in Labour strongholds while Jeremy Corbyn targets swing seats he hopes to take from the Tories.
But while they continue to battle it out around the country, the latest poll tracker shows Labour have tightened the gap – but suggest they won’t have done enough to deny Mr Johnson the majority he wants.
According to PA’s poll of polls, the Conservatives enter the final week of campaigning up at 43%, with Labour 10 points behind at 33%.
The Liberal Democrats are down again on 12% with leader Jo Swinson admitting it ‘doesn’t look likely’ her party will win a majority.
She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s only in the circumstances of a Liberal Democrat majority government which of course in itself would be democratic.
‘But where we are right now that obviously doesn’t look likely.’
She added: ‘The most likely way we can stop Brexit is through a people’s vote and the Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote for three-and-a-half years.’
The Brexit Party remain on 4% after a bruising week for Nigel Farage, whose own MEPs quit to pledge allegiance to the Tories.
And the Green Party is polling at 3% after encouraging tactical voting by teaming up with the Lib Dems.
The poll is based on an average of polling over the last week.
Mr Johnson has said in an open letter today that Thursday’s vote is ‘historic’ and a choice to ‘move forwards’ after Brexit.
Mr Corbyn said it was a ‘chance to vote for hope’ and he had ‘the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades’.
Later today, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will announce the Labour Party’s plan for its first 100 days should it win the general election – vowing to end austerity for good.
Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ‘the very future of Scotland’ is at stake in the election.
She is appealing to voters to back her party ‘to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands’.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Horrified onlookers were pushed back by huge crowds of people as a savage punch-up erupted last night at Winter Wonderland in London’s Hyde Park.
Screams could be heard in the background as the two men rapidly traded blows, with one getting his opponent in a headlock.
But others appeared to revel in the violence, as a video shared on social media shows a man jumping up and down with excitement.
Someone shouts as someone else shouts ‘Don’t punch the head’ as people circle around the pair to watch the fight.
Footage then shows security guards in high-vis vests forming a human chain in an attempt to break up the brawl.
The Metropolitan Police say three people were arrested for public order offences at the popular Christmas attraction yesterday but it is not known if they involved in the fight.
People on social media condemned the ‘thuggish-low life behaviour’ and said the venue had become ‘unsafe for children’.
It is thought the brawl broke out as people queued to get into the main beer hall of Winter Wonderland’s Bavarian Village.
An onlooker said massive crowd had gathered outside as the hall had been shut for an hour and was just re-opening.
They told MailOnline: ‘Security were saying it would take two hours to get in and people started getting agitated and pushing to get to the top.
‘Then two men started fighting and throwing punches and everyone was getting pushed back but there was nowhere to go.
‘Security had to move back a barrier to stop people getting trampled, it was quite scary and it’s really lucky nobody was hurt.’
The witness said they saw security guards forming a human chain to stop people rushing into the beet hall amidst the chaos.
They said they saw one of the men bleeding from the fight and the other being arrested later on.
Despite efforts to split everyone up, the witness said violence erupted again as people began flooding into the beer hall.
The onlooker said a cover version singer was pulled off stage and replaced by Bavarian band playing ‘sedate folk music’ in an attempt to keep people calm.
‘At least a dozen’ people were reportedly thrown out by security and bar staff decided to stop selling alcohol.
A Hyde Park Winter Wonderland spokesperson said: ‘We can confirm Police and security staff ejected a number of people following incidents at Hyde Park Winter Wonderland last night. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">£400 million pounds of unused Oyster card credit could be given to the homeless this Christmas, a London Mayoral candidate says.
Liberal Democrat Siobhan Benita is calling for the capital’s residents to be able to hand in ‘dormant’ cards, so the small amounts of cash left on them can be donated to help rough sleepers.
Transport for London (TfL) estimated at the end of September that it was sitting on £400 million in accounts not used for 12 months.
Now Ms Benita wants current mayor Sadiq Khan to enable Londoners to hand in their unwanted cards to benefit homeless charities.
Ms Benita, who last week spent a night sleeping on the streets to fundraise, is calling for the Mayor and Mike Brown, the Commissioner of TfL, to adopt her scheme over the festive period.
Claiming her ‘#OystersForChristmas campaign’ could ‘raise millions’ for homeless charities, she added: ‘I’m calling on the current Mayor to help us release that money.
‘If Sadiq Khan is serious about helping the thousands of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in London this Christmas, he could act now and do something which would have a real impact on vulnerable people’s lives over the festive period and beyond.’
Ms Benita, who says she would establish a new unit to address homelessness and rough sleeping if she wins next year, continued: ‘It’s shocking that the number of rough sleepers in London has surged to a record high, with around 22 new people now sleeping on the streets for the first time each day.
‘It’s shameful that London accounts for over a quarter of the total number of people sleeping rough in England. After nearly a full term as Mayor, Sadiq Khan’s rough sleeping strategy has clearly failed.’
An estimated two homeless people died every day in England and Wales in 2018, according to a shocking report released by the Office for National Statistics in October.
And earlier this month, another report on the rising homelessness crisis said a child becomes homeless every eight minutes in Britain.
Balbir Chatrik, Director of Policy at Centrepoint – a charity which would benefit from the scheme – said: ‘Instead of gathering dust, unused Oyster cards could help raise money for homeless young Londoners. Centrepoint would put this money to use by providing homeless young people with a safe place to live, while helping them to find a home and a job long-term.
‘Extra funding would allow us to expand our Helpline that young people can call for advice when faced with homelessness: 0808 800 0661.’
TfL’s Chief Technology Officer, Shashi Verma, said: ‘Customers can already donate their old Oyster cards to the Railway Children via charity boxes at Heathrow Airport, Kings Cross and Liverpool St. Over the last decade, this has helped raise more than £218K for the Railway Children, an international children’s charity who work with street children in India, East Africa and the UK.
‘We are currently looking to expand the scheme with boxes at a number of additional sites across our network, as well as see whether there are additional options of allowing customer to donate to the Railway Children charity via Oyster refunds in the future.’
Ms Benita is facing competition from Labour incumbent Mr Khan, Conservative Shaun Bailey, Green leader Sian Berry, independent Rory Stewart and others in the May 7 vote.
Mr Khan’s office was contacted for comment.
This weekend, people across Britain took part in the Big Sleep Out, which saw around 60,000 worldwide participate in an initiative to raise money for homeless charities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NHS promises from all major parties are 'not physically possible'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leading health officials have said promises made by the major parties on the NHS are misleading or impossible.
Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said politicians had ducked the big issues in regard to health and social care.
While Royal College of Physicians president professor Andrew Goddard said manifesto promises on the NHS were not ‘physically possible’ because of a lack of people in training to fulfil them.
They both said they have ‘grave concerns’ over how the major parties have campaigned on the NHS throughout the election campaign.
The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised above-inflation increases to spending on frontline care.
Labour has pledged to boost nurse numbers by 24,000 while the Tories have promised 50,000 nurses, but this would include almost 20,000 who are current staff.
But Mr Hopson said politicians on both sides had failed to offer ‘credible answers’ to the NHS’s toughest challenges and that the funding commitments they had made were disappointing.
He wrote in The Times today: ‘In reality, they go no further than restoring NHS funding growth to what they’ve been in past.
‘But it’s not just about money. Whilst we are pleased that parties are committing to increase staff numbers, it’s still not clear how that will actually happen.
‘The offers from the main parties have varied in scope and ambition, but none has developed a compelling worked-through and credibly funded long-term solution.’
He added there was a ‘worrying mismatch’ between what the major parties were promising and what their pledged funding would actually buy.
Mr Hopson said: ‘Bandying about large-sounding increases, based on five-year aggregate numbers, and saying “all will be well” is raising unrealistic expectations that the NHS will inevitably disappoint.’
Meanwhile Prof Goddard warned patients in hospital should get used to seeing their doctors less as the health service reached ‘crunch point’.
He told The Independent he was frustrated ‘by the proposed policies and promises’ by Labour and the Tories and their ‘relationship to reality and what actually is deliverable’.
The East Midlands gastroenterologist also said all three major parties had failed to address the looming workforce crisis among NHS doctors.
Labour and the Tories had used the NHS as a ‘political football’ he said, adding: ‘It’s really hard. In my life I have voted for all three main political parties.
‘I currently have internal conflicts on which way I will vote, there is no easy choice. None of the parties has thought about the long-term problems facing us.
‘The promises that have been made in the manifestos are not physically possible because we don’t have enough people training to fulfil those promises.
‘We need to think about where we want to be in 15 years’ time and plan for it now.’
He argued that Labour’s proposals to train 5,000 more GPs would result in fewer doctors training in psychiatry or emergency medicine.
The Tories’ plan to have 6,000 more GPs by 2024 was not feasible without ‘flooding’ the trainee system with overseas doctors, Prof Goddard said.
Currently, the NHS pays around £1.5 billion to train around 7,250 doctors a year, but the professor said this needed to double to about 15,000 a year, at a cost in excess of £3 billion.

It will also symbolise how successful the Tories have been at this election in overturning generations of political tradition in Labour’s heartlands.
Only four MPs have represented Great Grimsby since the end of the Second World War, all of them Labour – Kenneth Younger, Tony Crosland, Austin Mitchell and Melanie Onn.
It has been a marginal seat ahead of various elections, including 1964, 1987 and 2015, but on each occasion Labour held on.
Now that might be about to change.
The Conservatives need a swing of 3.7% on December 12 to overturn Ms Onn’s majority of 2,565.
Polls suggest the party might be on course to take the seat with candidate Lia Nici, and by a comfortable margin.
It is an outcome that could be repeated in other constituencies across northern England with decades of Labour history.
Examples include Bishop Auckland (Labour since 1935), Wakefield (1932), Don Valley (1922) and Rother Valley (1918).
All of these seats could turn blue on December 12 if the Conservatives perform strongly.
Boris Johnson visited Great Grimsby on Monday while on the campaign trail.
If his party wins the seat this week, it will vindicate the Tories’ strategy of targeting Leave-backing Labour voters in parts of the country that have not seen Conservative MPs for generations.
Six candidates are standing in Great Grimsby: Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Green, the Brexit Party and an Independent.

"Winds will strengthen through the morning with gusts of 50-60 mph likely inland, and 60-70 mph around some coasts and over higher ground.
"The strongest winds will probably occur ahead of an intense band of rain that is expected to move quickly eastwards during the day, winds easing once this clears."
This is what to expect:
• Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely
• Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer, made worse by spray and surface water
• Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely
• Some short term loss of power and other services is possible

CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) — More than a century ago, waves of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Poland and Quebec settled in Chicopee and other western Massachusetts mill towns, helping build churches, rectories and schools to accommodate their faith. Today the priests leading those churches are under siege due to stresses, challenges and sex abuse scandals complicating their lives and those of their fellow priests across the United States.
The Rev. Mark Stelzer is among those trying to persevere. He's a professor at a Roman Catholic college in Chicopee, and its chaplain. He travels frequently to out-of-state events organized by a Catholic addiction-treatment provider, recounting his own recovery from alcoholism.
Last year, his busy schedule got busier. Amid a worsening shortage of priests, the Diocese of Springfield named him administrator of a parish in Holyoke, Chicopee’s northern neighbor, where he lives alone in a mansion-sized rectory while serving as spiritual leader to the 500 families of St. Jerome’s Church.
“I’m at an age where I thought I’d be doing less rather than doing more,” said Stelzer, 62.
Stelzer loves being a priest, yet he's frank about the ever-evolving stresses of his vocation that leave him nostalgic for the priesthood he entered in 1983.
“It was a lot simpler then,” he said. “There’s a real longing, a mourning for the church that was — when there was a greater fraternity among priests, and the church was not facing these scandals that are now emerging every day.”
Stelzer’s concerns echoed those of other priests, and some of their psychological caregivers, who were interviewed by The Associated Press.
Weighing on the entire Catholic clergy in the U.S. is the ripple effect of their church’s long-running crisis arising from sex abuse committed by priests. It’s caused many honorable priests to sense an erosion of public support and to question the leadership of some of their bishops. That dismay is often compounded by increased workloads due to the priest shortage, and increased isolation as multi-priest parishes grow scarce. They see trauma firsthand. Some priests minister in parishes wracked by gun violence; others preside frequently over funerals of drug-overdose victims.
One such victim was a 31-year-old woman whose family was among Stelzer’s closest friends. “This is one of the few times I actually felt my voice quivering,” he said of the funeral service he led last year.
Burnout has been a perennial problem for clergy of many faiths. But Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at California's Santa Clara University who has screened or treated hundreds of Catholic clerics, sees new forms of it as the sex abuse crisis persists and many parishioners lose trust in Catholic leadership.
“You’re just trying to be a good priest and now everyone thinks you’re a sex offender,” he said. “If you walk in a park with your collar on, people think you’re on the lookout for children. ... Some have been spat upon.”
The Springfield diocese, like many across the U.S., has a long history of sex-abuse scandals. In the early 1990s, priest Richard Lavigne was defrocked and several of his victims received cash settlements. In 2004, a grand jury indicted Thomas Dupre on two counts of child molestation soon after he resigned following a 13-year stint as Springfield’s bishop.
Stelzer had hoped the abuse crisis was abating but it resurfaced dramatically over the past two years. Abuse allegations led to former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s ouster from the priesthood and a Pennsylvania grand jury report asserted that about 300 priests had abused at least 1,000 children in the state over seven decades.
“It opened up an old wound, and now we're back to ground zero,” Stelzer said in an interview at the College of Our Lady of the Elms.
The wound is self-inflicted, said Rev. Philip Schmitter, 74, who has served for 50 years in Flint, Michigan. His stance endears him to an African American community where he lived in public housing for three decades to maintain close ties.
“This cover up, this ‘Let's protect the institution’ was just a heinous, utterly unchristian kind of behavior,” he said.

Two miles north of Stelzer’s campus, on a recent Sunday, the Rev. William Tourigny was getting ready for the 4 p.m. Mass — his fourth and last of the day — at Ste. Rose de Lima Church.
When Tourigny, now 66, was ordained in 1980, the Springfield diocese had more than 300 priests serving 136 parishes. Since then, the ranks of priests have shrunk by more than half and nearly 60 of the parishes have closed. For Tourigny, it’s meant many more funerals to handle, including dozens related to drug overdoses and heavy drinking.
Even his own family has been scarred: Tourigny says the 27-year-old daughter of his first cousin was killed in circumstances he describes as fueled by her drug habit.
“But for her addiction, she was a wonderful mother,” Tourigny said.
Tourigny says he’s worked nearly 40 years without a real vacation. For years, he’s had therapy sessions, which he describes as “crucially important,” and he strives to minister compassionately without being engulfed in the emotions of those he consoles.
“I can share their pain but I can’t enter into it,” he said. “I’d be overwhelmed by grief.”
With 2,500 families, many of Polish and French Canadian descent, Tourigny's parish has fared better with membership and finances than several nearby parishes. Yet Tourigny says many Catholics now mistrust the church hierarchy because of the flawed response to the abuse scandals.
“I was ordained at a time when the church was so alive — there was so much optimism,” he said. “Then things began to change quickly. It has changed the way people look at us. The church has lost credibility and it’s hard to get credibility back again.”
Plante, the California psychologist, says even priests deeply devoted to their work are upset.
“A lot are angry at bishops and the institutional church for screwing up — a lot of them feel they’ve been thrown under the bus,” he said. “They’re also concerned that one of these days someone will accuse them of misbehavior, even if they’ve done nothing wrong. They’re asking, 'Did I do something 30 years ago that could be misconstrued, that will come back and haunt me?'”
The Rev. Stephen Fichter, pastor of St. Elizabeth Church in Wyckoff, New Jersey, said he has counseled people who’ve been abused by Catholic clergy and understands the “pain and horror” they experienced. Yet he voiced concerns on behalf of priests with unblemished careers who feel vulnerable to unwarranted suspicions.
“Sometimes a priest is confronted by an anonymous accusation from 30 or 40 years ago, and doesn’t have a chance to defend himself,” Fichter said. “It used to be innocent until proven guilty. Now a lot of priests feel it’s been turned upside down.”

Mark Stelzer proudly identifies himself as an alumnus of Guest House, a residential facility in Michigan that has specialized in addiction treatment for Catholic clergy since 1956. He travels frequently to make presentations on behalf of Guest House, and teaches a course at his Chicopee college titled “Addiction and Recovery.”
By the time he was ordained, Stelzer says, he was consuming alcohol daily. Only after five more years of steady drinking did acquaintances suggest he had a problem, leading to his stay at Guest House.
Guest House’s president, Jeff Henrich, is an experienced drug and alcohol counselor. He says substance abuse among priests is a longstanding problem but has been aggravated by recent developments — including the “residual shame” arising from the sex-abuse scandals and increased isolation as more priests now manage parishes on their own.
Since 1985, according to researchers at Georgetown University, the Catholic population in the U.S. has risen by nearly 20%, but the number of priests has plunged from more than 57,000 to under 37,000.
“There’s fewer of them and more work to do,” Henrich said. “That means you’re far more likely to live alone than ever before — and very few of us were meant to live alone.”
In response, treatment experts urge priests in recovery to find companionship in a support group and to form friendships outside their ministry.
Stelzer agrees that isolation raises the risks of substance abuse.
“We’re lone rangers,” he said. “Substance abuse might go undetected for longer when you’re living alone. A lot of those in treatment now say it was because of isolation, working harder and longer, and not feeling support from leadership.”
The harmful consequences of the priest shortage have come to the attention of the Vatican's ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Christophe Pierre. Addressing U.S. bishops in November, he urged them to be attentive to their priests’ health, spiritual well-being and sense of priestly fraternity.
“Many priests are saying they no longer know one another,” Pierre said. “Others, due to the priest shortage, are forced to live in isolation, managing multiple parishes.”
Stress, burnout, depression and addictions are among the conditions treated at St. Luke Institute, a residential treatment center for Catholic clergy and lay leaders, in Silver Spring, Maryland.
St. Luke’s president, the Rev. David Songy, is a psychologist who has worked extensively with troubled priests. One growing problem, he says, is that new priests are now often assigned their own parish within three years, instead of 10 or more in the past, and may be ill-prepared to oversee finances and personnel as well as pastoral duties.
“Some of the younger people that come to us — they’ve been overwhelmed and weren’t sure how to deal with things,” Songy said.
Other stressful changes relate to ideological differences. Tourigny considers himself a progressive and has welcomed lesbian couples into Ste. Rita. He says many young priests now emerging from seminary are less tolerant of LGBTQ congregants and eager to revive the tradition of celebrating Mass in Latin.
Another change noted by several priests: Some parishioners, rather than showing deference to their pastors, openly challenge them.
“In the past they might have disagreed, but they’d be courteous. Now it’s different,” said Fichter. “They think you are not Republican enough or Democratic enough depending on which end of the political spectrum they occupy. ... They want you to preach what they want to hear, and they will confront you.”
At St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York — just north of New York City — there’s increased emphasis on screening applicants for their ability to handle stress and avoid the burnout that’s now affecting some priests even early in their ministry.
“There’s no doubt these men coming forward are facing what will be a very stressful life,” said the Rev. Thomas Berg, the seminary’s vice rector. “We must be sure they have the skill set or will be able to develop it.”
“On top of that, in some places, you don’t have a sense that their bishop supports them,” added Berg. “In plenty of dioceses, priests are essentially treated as outside contractors — there’s a lack of a genuinely caring relationship.”
___
Police officers, firefighters and paramedics are collectively labeled first responders. Henrich, the Guest House president, says priests also merit that label.
“They see trauma and loss on a very regular basis,” he said. “They get called out to hospitals, deal with grieving families, with lost and dead children.”
Gun violence is the plague besetting the Rev. Mike Pfleger’s parish in an African American area of Chicago.
"It's a war zone,” says Pfleger, an outspoken pastor at Saint Sabina Church since 1981. “Doing funerals of children is the hardest for me.”
The violence has ripple effects: He says parents of slain young people go through divorce, mental breakdowns, addiction.
“It becomes overwhelming when it’s day in and day out, and you don’t have the resources to meet the needs,” he said.
Now 70, Pfleger says his health is good, and his work rewarding. Yet he says he and his colleagues risk being overwhelmed by the crises facing their neighborhood of Auburn Gresham.
“I was seeing myself becoming depressed, after several violent deaths in a short span,” he said. “I needed to make sure I talked to somebody.
“Last year I didn’t take any days off — I realized that was a big mistake,” he added. “It’s important to have people around you to say, ‘Are you OK?’”
In Brunswick, Ohio, a town of 34,000 people 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland, the Rev. Robert Stec’s priorities have been transformed, due to the scourge of opioids, since he became pastor of St. Ambrose Church in 2005.
In 2016, Brunswick’s Medina County reported 20 opioid-related deaths. Stec presided over six funerals of those victims in a short span. While sharing parishioners’ grief, Stec resolved to combat the opioid epidemic and founded a multifaith coalition of northeast Ohio religious leaders.
Stec is grateful that Brunswick has better-than-average mental health services. But he and his fellow priests in drug-ravaged towns still employ a triage policy, seeking help for the most dire cases, because they can’t provide comprehensive support to every affected parishioner.
“We weren’t trained for this in the seminary,” he said.
Still the priests treasure their jobs despite the challenges. Mark Stelzer holds onto his role as a comforter. “For a lot of people, I’m the last person they saw while they were still alive,” he said. “There's an energy and grace in those moments.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) - More than a century ago, waves of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Poland and Quebec settled in Chicopee and other western Massachusetts mill towns, helping build churches, rectories and schools to accommodate their faith.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Once propped up by Qatari high-rollers, Saudi city prays for truce</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Al-Ahsa (Saudi Arabia) (AFP) - Jackhammers and cranes gather dust at half-built Qatari-funded hotel sites in a Saudi city hit hard by an abrupt diplomatic rupture, but signs of thawing cross-border ties are reviving economic hopes.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has downplayed the dispute with Qatar -- which led to a Riyadh-led embargo on the neighbouring emirate and shuttered their land border in mid-2017 -- as a trivial matter with limited impact on the kingdom.
But it is anything but trivial for Al-Ahsa, a desert oasis near the border where Qatari shoppers once kept the local economy humming, crossing over to buy relatively cheaper provisions -- from herbs and eggs to milk and camel meat.
The deep-pocketed residents of gas-rich Qatar -- one of the wealthiest countries per capita -- also pumped millions of riyals into local hotels, date plantations and other real estate.
But the Qatari money dried up when the embargo shut them out, unleashing economic pain and dividing extended families on both sides, an unintended consequence of a policy meant to hurt Doha's government.
The Saudi-led bloc accuses Qatar of backing radical Islamists including Muslim Brotherhood and seeking closer ties with Riyadh's arch nemesis Iran -- charges Doha denies.
"The blockade had a negative impact on towns near the border and complicated investments at a time when Saudi Arabia's economy is struggling with large deficits," said Samuel Ramani, a doctoral researcher at Oxford University.
Official statistics are hard to come by but the tell-tale signs of the economic impact are everywhere in Al-Ahsa, home to more than a million people.
Its malls and traditional souks are emptier, multiple gas stations leading up to the border have shuttered, and even salesmen of bisht, traditional gold-trimmed robes, complain of depressed sales.
Shells of three Qatari-funded luxury hotels lie abandoned after construction was halted abruptly in 2017, a long-term investment some believe was intended to accommodate any surplus guests of Qatar's 2022 football World Cup.
The manager of another Al-Ahsa hotel pointed at his vacant parking lot, once full of cars with Qatari plates. The hotel's occupancy rate tanked after the embargo, and it has barely managed to cover its electricity bill, he told AFP.
But the fact that the majority of Qatari investors have not liquidated their investments in Al-Ahsa despite the embargo gives some hope it will be business as usual if relations are restored.
- Hopeful signs -
The feud is not irreconcilable, residents say, describing it as a spat between squabbling cousins. And amid signs of a thaw, many are betting on the return of Qatari high-rollers.
"The rift is between governments, not the people," said an Al-Ahsa businessman who asked not to be named.
"We are not different countries, we are one big family."
Arab diplomats say both sides are closer than ever to bringing the dispute to an end.
Raising hopes is recent "sports diplomacy", which saw football teams from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain travel to Qatar for the Gulf Cup despite earlier indications that they would boycott the tournament.
State-funded media networks on all sides recently appear to have toned down the shrill rhetoric against each other.
Qatar's foreign minister, who travelled to Saudi Arabia last month for talks, has spoken of "some progress" in negotiations.
But the real bellwether will be the level of Qatari representation at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in Riyadh on Tuesday. The Saudi king has personally invited Qatar's emir, but it remains unclear whether he will attend.
Two sources familiar with the negotiations, including an Arab diplomat, told AFP that hardliners in Abu Dhabi -- Riyadh's principal ally -- are opposed to a restoration of ties.
This has raised the prospect of a "bifurcated peace", implying Qatar could possibly normalise ties with only some blockading nations including Saudi Arabia, with whom it shares its only land border.
- 'Punishment' -
Saudi Arabia appears to be adopting a de-escalatory approach after a series of what observers describe as foreign policy "missteps" that have spooked investors.
A cool reception by global investors to state energy giant Aramco's stock sale has highlighted the downside of its aggressive stance, they say.
Ramani said the rapprochement appears to be shaping up "without major concessions from Doha", after the blockade boosted its self-reliance.
Once heavily dependent on food imports, it has developed new trade routes, flown in thousands of dairy cows and developed poultry farms to beat the embargo.
"Qatar is like a newborn baby kicked out of a house as punishment," the Arab diplomat -- who is from outside the Gulf -- told AFP.
"You thought it would come back crying to you, but it has stood on its feet and does not need you anymore."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Several injured, about 100 people in the area as New Zealand's White Island volcano erupts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WELLINGTON: About 100 people were near New Zealand's White Island volcano when it erupted suddenly on Monday (Dec 9), leaving authorities scrambling to treat the injured and find those unaccounted for.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the volcanic island - also known as Whakaari - off New Zealand's north coast had erupted while groups of tourists were visiting.
"It is very much an evolving situation and of course all our thoughts are with those affected," she told reporters in Wellington, adding that an undetermined number of people were unaccounted for.
Authorities said the eruption began about 2.30pm local time (9.30am Singapore time), throwing smoke and debris into the air.
The island is about 50km from North Island in the picturesque Bay of Plenty, and is popular with adventurous tourists willing to don hard hats and gas masks.
The White Island volcano is one of New Zealand's most active volcanoes.
According to the national Met Service, the eruption was visible on satellite images. 
Whakatane mayor Judy Turner said "there have been people injured" and rescue missions were under way.
"I don't know how many or the state of their injuries but emergency services are currently frantically trying to get these people back from the island to hospital for treatment," she said.
She added that there seems to be no danger for the people in the coastal areas, farther from the volcano.
St John Ambulance said there were up to 20 people believed injured but medical teams were still en route.
There were particular fears for a group of visitors seen walking on the crater floor moments before the eruption occurred.
Cameras providing a live feed from the volcano showed more than half a dozen people walking inside the rim at 2.10pm local time (9.10am Singapore time), before images went dark when the eruption occurred minutes later.
Police said they were responding to the incident, but offered no further comment.
A report by the NZ Herald said many of those visiting White Island on Monday were from the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.
Port of Tauranga company chief executive Mark Cairns was quoted as saying that he understood the majority of those injured in the eruption are from the ship. 
New Zealand's national emergency crisis centre has been activated.
The volcanic eruption made the area immediately around the island hazardous, the National Emergency Management Agency said in an emailed statement.
The agency described the eruption as "moderate", although a thick plume of white ash could be seen for miles around.
Several helicopters and aircraft could be seen in the area.
White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano cone and about 70 per cent of it is undersea, according to government agency GeoNet.
Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.
In August of that year the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Volcano Erupts in New Zealand, Tourists are Missing (VIDEO)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of tourists were near New Zealand's island when a volcano erupted there, the Associated Press reported, citing country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Some people have been injured and others are still missing.
The volcano began erupting at 2.30pm local time on Monday. White Island is located about 50 km off the North Shore's eastern coast and is often frequented by tourists.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there were "a number" of tourists on or around the island, both from New Zealand and overseas.
"I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who have loved ones at the island at that time - and I can assure them police are doing everything they can," she said.
According to her, there seems to be no danger to people in coastal areas distant from the volcano.
Smoke from the eruption is also visible from the continental part, and the National Emergency Response Agency has warned that some areas may be affected by the burning ash.
According to local media, there were many people around and on the island. 
The island's volcano is one of the most active in New Zealand. Twelve people died on the island in 1914, when sulfur was obtained from it. Part of the volcano's crater has collapsed and the collapse has destroyed the mining village and the mine itself.
The White Island is also known as  Whakaari.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trouble brews in post-election Sri Lanka</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two weeks after the election of hardliner Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka, the prospects for justice and reconciliation between the different communities on the island lie in tatters. The victory of Gota, as he is commonly known, sent shockwaves across the Tamil-dominated northeast - where memories of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa's brutal presidency, marked by mass atrocities and enforced disappearances, remain fresh. 
Gota, who served as defence secretary between 2005 and 2015, stands accused of war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war (1983-2009).
The Tamil community were hoping for a victory of Sajith Premadasa, the deputy leader of the United National Party (UNP), who was seen by Tamils as the "lesser evil". While Premadasa also adopted nationalist rhetoric during his campaign, vowing to protect military chief Shavendra Silva from war crimes accusations and pledging to give prominence to Buddhism, minorities were terrified at the prospect of a return to the brutal authoritarianism of the Rajapaksas.
Tamils and Tamil-speaking Muslims went to the polls in large numbers, with the vast majority of the northeastern vote going to Premadasa. But it was not enough for his victory. His opponent, Gota,swept the Sinhala south, winning the election with a whopping majority.
After the vote, members of the Sinhalese majority levelled accusations of disloyalty and separatism against Tamils - once again exposing the deep fault lines running between the two major ethnic groups on the island.
The faint hopes for justice and reconciliation during the term of Gota's predecessor, Maithripala Sirisena, encouraged by over-enthusiastic Western governments and a Colombo-based elite, disconnected from ground realities and preoccupied with promoting superficial processes, are now gone. Sri Lanka is slipping back into chauvinistic politics which threatens to destabilise the country.
The new president wasted no time reaffirming his "strongman" credentials, immediately rallying his Sinhala Buddhist base after the election.
In his inaugural speech on November 18, he pledged to lead the government based on "Buddhist philosophy" and to support the Sinhalese culture and Buddhist heritage and highlighted his role in the civil war.
The inauguration ceremony was held at a Buddhist temple in the northern city of Anuradhapura built by Sinhala ruler Dutugamunu, who defeated the Tamil Chola King Ellalan and united the entire island under Sinhala rule. 
Gota also moved against those he saw as a threat to his government. He imposed a travel ban on police officers involved in investigations of alleged crimes perpetrated by his family after one of them fled the country to Switzerland after the election. Following his escape, an employee of the Swiss visa section was detained and questioned, a worrying development which could endanger the work of foreign embassies on the island.
Tamil and Sinhala media have also faced increasing pressure since the vote. Several journalists were forced to hand their computers to the police over unsubstantiated accusations of spreading hate speech. Tamil activists have ramped up their security protocols and some are reconsidering their continued presence in the country. Self-censorship has become the norm once again.
Meanwhile, hate speech, particularly against Tamils, has exploded on social media, with no action taken against those posting. In the centre of the country, Tamils were attacked by Sinhalese, who accused them of voting against Gota.
It is quite clear that under the new president, Sri Lanka will continue to embrace the persistent chauvinism that has dominated its political scene since independence from Britain in 1948.
The main idea behind it is that Sri Lanka is a Sinhala Buddhist country and those of different faith or ethnicity migrated from elsewhere and are not part of the native population of the island. Today, the Sri Lankan constitution gives Sinhala Buddhism primacy, guaranteeing it the "foremost place" and entrusting the state with protecting and fostering it. State institutions, the military and the economy are also dominated by a Sinhala supremacist ethos. 
Meanwhile, those perceived as "outsiders" - Tamils, Tamil-speaking Muslims, Christians and others - are expected to submit to Sinhala Buddhist primacy on the island and relent to being treated as subordinate. Any resistance to their inferior status is seen as a threat to Sinhala Buddhist supremacy in Sri Lanka and viciously attacked by the majority.
It was against this chauvinism of the Sinhalese majority that the Tamils rose in rebellion in the 20th century. The long-running war for Tamil self-rule culminated in the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009. A yet unknown number of Tamil civilians died in the final months of the war. The United Nations says there could have been more than 70,000 deaths during this time, while some activists say the figure is closer to 140,000.
Calls for justice for repeated atrocities committed against Tamils by the state have fallen on deaf ears. Nevertheless, families of the forcefully disappeared during the conflict continue to raise their voices, defying a state that denies that crimes were committed against the Tamil community.
Gota's victory is seen as a major setback by Tamils, but has not discouraged them. Ten days after his inauguration, Tamils turned out in droves to commemorate Maaveerar Naal, the Tamil National Remembrance Day, in moving ceremonies at multiple locations across the northeast.
This, despite harassment by local authorities, arrests of a number of individuals involved in preparations for the commemoration and fears of a crackdown. Every main Tamil newspaper on the island covered the day on their front pages, sometimes with emotional tributes. 
In Kilinochchi, the former administrative capital of the Tamil Eelam administration, thousands took part in a ceremony, laying flowers and lighting torches at a burial ground for LTTE fighters destroyed by the army. Amid tears and wailing by those mourning the dead, songs were played promising the establishment of Tamil Eelam, as the crowd sang along. The defiance was palpable.
As I joined families filing past the fragments of headstones, one man, whose sister was an LTTE fighter, killed in the fighting, told me, "We will not forget and our children won't forget. For as long as we exist as a people, the struggle for freedom from oppression will continue." Ten years after the end of the LTTE, the resistance to the state continues to define the politics of Tamils.
When Sirisena of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015, Sri Lanka was prematurely hailed as a success story, as the United States and the European Union swiftly re-engaged with the government, restarting trade and military cooperation, which had suffered severely under the first Rajapaksa reign.
While the then-government made a plethora of pledges to enact political reforms and establish an accountability mechanism, it failed to act on them. The enthusiastic coddling of Sri Lanka by the international community post-2015 undermined the urgency for progress, by removing the pressure brought about by international criticism, which had made Sri Lanka commit to those pledges in the first place.
The openness of the last five years under the internationally supported but shaky UNP-SLFP government is seen by many Tamils as an abnormality. Repression has been the norm in Sri Lanka and Gota's victory is a return to that norm. 
The events of November once again revealed the fundamental problem of the country and its nation-building project. The Sri Lankan political system has failed to give minority communities proper representation, while the state continues to promote an exclusionary national identity.
Gota has reiterated that he will not focus on political grievances, instead putting his efforts into the development of Tamil regions. This will not appease the Tamils. Without a fundamental rethinking of the Sri Lankan state, national identity and the foremost place given to Sinhala Buddhism, the conflict that has plagued this island since independence will continue to fester.
While there is no appetite among Tamils for a renewed war, the unfettered Sinhala Buddhist nationalist agenda touted by Gota, expected to include renewed efforts to change the demographic makeup of the northeast, will fuel ethnic conflict and division. 
As this government has made it abundantly clear that it will not initiate the necessary reforms to accommodate minorities, the international community must condition its engagement with Sri Lanka on progress on justice and political devolution. Without these political changes, Sri Lanka will remain a failed nation and a divided island.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Citizenship bill not even .001 per cent against minorities,' says Amit Shah</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday introduced contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in Lok Sabha and said that it is not even .001 per cent against minorities in the country.
"This Bill is not even .001 per cent against minorities in the country," Shah said in the House, amid much uproar by the opposition.
 
Shah said that Muslims from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't get the benefit of this amendment as they have not faced religious persecution.
"If any Muslim from these three (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh) nations applies for citizenship according to our law, then we will consider it, but the person won't get the benefit of this amendment as the person has not faced religious persecution," said Shah in the Lower House.
"In Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains have been discriminated against. So, this bill will give these persecuted people citizenship. Also, the allegation that this Bill will take away the rights of Muslims is wrong," he said.
"Why do we need this Bill today? After independence, if the Congress had not done the partition on the basis of religion, then today we would have not needed this Bill," he said.
The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019 seeks to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.
Through this bill, Indian citizenship will be provided to the members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from the three countries to India till December 31, 2014, to put an end to them being treated as illegal immigrants in the country.
It is important to note that the Bill was passed by the Lower House of the Parliament earlier this year but lapsed with the term of the previous Lok Sabha during the first term of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government in the Centre.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amaravati: Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP president, N Chandrababu Naidu, on Monday staged a protest against the sharp increase in onion prices.
Naidu and his party colleagues wore onion garlands around their necks and protested at the fire station near the state secretariat in Venkatapalem village here.
 
The TDP leaders also carried a big onion model while a weighing scale, with gold on one side and onions on the other, was also seen at the protest to suggest that the vegetable has become a precious commodity with the skyrocketing prices.
"Onion prices have risen to the level of gold prices and the state government has failed to reduce the price. Our fight will continue until the prices of onion come down," Naidu said.
Raising slogans against the Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government, Naidu marched towards the state assembly where they were stopped by the police when they tried to enter inside the premises.
This action by the police led to a verbal altercation between them and TDP leaders.
On Sunday, people queued in West Godavari district to buy onions at subsidised rates at a Rythu bazaar (farmers market).
The price of onions has been on the rise in many states over the past week, which has even sparked protests among the people.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BS Yediyurappa celebrates with son as trends show BJP leading in K'taka by-polls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bengaluru: With the trends indicating a victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 12 seats, the mood is upbeat in the BJP camp with party workers and leaders celebrating at the state office.
Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa celebrated the early leads with his son BY Vijayendra who sought his father's blessings and greeted him with sweets.
 
The BJP candidates are leading from the Athani, Kagwad, Gokak, Yellapur, Hirekerur, Ranibennur, Vijayanagara, Chikkaballapur, K.R.Pura, Yeshvanthapura, Krishnarajapete and the Mahalakshmi Layout seats.
Two Congress candidates, on the other hand, are leading on the Hunasuru and Shivajinagar constituencies while an independent candidate, Sharath Kumar Bachegowda is also leading from the Hosakote seat in the initial phases of the counting.
K Gopalaiah, the BJP candidate from the Mahalakshmi Layout has the biggest margin of 32 thousand votes against Congress' M Shivaraja.
On the other hand, Congress' HP Manjunath is also leading by a margin of 33 thousand votes against BJP's H Vishwanath from the Hunasuru seat.
The result will not just decide the fate of BJP government in the state but also of those thirteen rebel MLAs who had sought the re-election following their resignation from erstwhile Congress-JD(S) coalition.
Earlier Yediyurappa had confidently said that BJP will win at least 13 seats and the government will be "safeguarded".
The elections were held for 15 Assembly seats which were left vacant after the legislators resigned in July, triggering the collapse of the Congress-JDS coalition and paving the way for the BJP to come to power.

    <h5 class="mb-1">F-117 Stealth Fighters Are Playing the Enemy (Taking on F-22s, F-15s and F-16s)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Eleven years after the U.S. Air Force officially retired the type, an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter has made yet another public appearance.
Plane-spotter Kris Tanjano was posted up outside the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada on Dec. 3, 2019 when he witnessed an aerial exercise play out overhead. F-117s apparently flying from Tonopah Test Range were in the mix along with F-16s, F-15s, F-22s and possibly B-1 bombers coming from Nellis Air Force Base.
The Lockheed-made stealth fighters apparently were acting as radar-evading adversaries in a mock battle with other plane types, Tanjano told Tyler Rogoway at The War Zone. “I witnessed an F-117 along with four F-16s go up against F-15s and F-22s. The F-117's callsign was KNIGHT, the F-16s were GOMER and MIG, and they were communicating on the aggressor frequency.”
“First, the F-16s came in pairs attacking the blue force (F-22s, F-15s, and maybe a B-1) then an F-117 came in at low-level just behind the F-16s towards the blue force,” Tanjano added. “They all fought it out for about five to 10 minutess then restarted for a second push. Once again the F-16s came high overhead, followed by a low-level F-117. Several times the aggressors called out a target which was a low-level heavy aircraft which I believe was B-1, but I am not certain.”
The sighting seems yet again to confirm what Rogoway long has suspected. “Having a small aggressor force of F-117s available for putting our and our allies' latest radars, infrared search and track and electronic emissions detection system to the test, as well as to develop tactics for defeating such threats, seems like a perfect job for the F-117.”
The first of 59 front-line F-117s became operational in the mid-1980s and most famously led deep strike missions targeting Iraqi forces during the 1991 Gulf War. F-22 stealth fighters in 2008 assumed the F-117s’ strike role pending the 2016 introduction of F-35 stealth fighter-bombers.
The Air Force packed many of the F-117s into a storage hangar at Tonopah. But some of the “retired” Nighthawks continued to fly on secretive missions. Amateur plane-spotters packing powerful cameras photographed and videotaped F-117s flying over the desert test range and taxiing on its remote runway, sometimes singly and sometimes in pairs.
Nighthawks also showed up on the ground. Photographer Chris McGreevy on Aug. 16, 2019 spotted a truck hauling an F-117 on Columbia Way near the Palmdale Regional Airport outside Palmdale, California.
Richard VanderMeulen on Feb. 26, 2019 photographed a single, unmarked F-117A flying over the restricted air space R-2508 range complex near Death Valley in southern California.
The photos, first published in Combat Aircraft, depicted an F-117 with partially worn or obscured markings flying at low altitude around the mountains. The aircraft made another brief appearance the next day.
The February 2019 sighting was notable for taking place outside of the air space around Tonopah Test Range, the F-117’s usual haunt. In a sort of preview of the December 2019 sighting, the Nighthawk appeared in the company of two F-16s.
“The F-16s may very well have been putting a new infrared search-and-track pod to the test or some other sensor system, or maybe they were just all out for a flight through the area to keep up basic competency,” Rogoway wrote. “We just don't know.”
Why would the Air Force want to keep a few Nighthawks operational, despite their age, complexity, high cost and the fact that Serbian air-defense forces figured out how to detect the planes and actually shot one down during the 1999 U.S.-led air war on Serbia?
Rogoway has ideas. “The F-117 is an incredibly valuable and well-understood stealthy target to test new sensor systems against and new low-observable (stealthy) coatings on.”
“On the radar and infrared tracking side of the argument, the F-117 is ... a near-perfect and highly available low-observable aircraft to test everything from ground-based radars and [surface-to-air missile] systems, both foreign and domestic, AWACS modifications, fighter radars and even infrared search-and-track systems.”
But the stealth fighters won’t last forever, Rogoway explained. “The F-117s are slowly disappearing into the abyss. Congress's former mandate to keep the fleet of roughly 52 jets in Type-1000 regenerative storage indefinitely at the high-security Tonopah Test Range Airport has ended.”
The Air Force plans annually to remove four F-117s from storage and dispose of them. At that rate, the remaining Nighthawks could disappear for good some time in the 2020s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China's Plan for 6 Aircraft Carriers Just 'Sank'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">China reportedly is slowing its plan to acquire two aircraft carriers for each of its regional fleets.
Instead of speeding ahead with the development of a six-carrier fleet -- two each for the northern, eastern and southern fleets -- the Chinese navy could stop after acquiring flattop number four.
“Plans for a fifth [carrier] have been put on hold for now, according to military insiders,” the Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported. “They said that technical challenges and high costs had put the brakes on the program.”
The possible pause in carrier-production could cement the yawning capability gap between the U.S. and Chinese fleets.
Song Zhongping, a military expert and T.V. commentator, in late 2018 toldGlobal Times that China needs at least five aircraft carriers to execute its military strategy. Wang Yunfei, a retired Chinese navy officer, said Beijing needs six flattops.
The Chinese defense ministry declined during a November 2018 press conference to specify how many carriers it ultimately planned to acquire.
But leaving aside the high cost, six flattops would have made sense. Equipping each of the three regional fleets with two flattops would have allowed one carrier from each fleet to deploy while the other underwent maintenance.
In 2019, each fleet possesses between 20 and 30 major surface warships, at least a dozen submarines and a handful of amphibious vessels. Just one, the Northern Theater Navy headquartered in Qingdao, operates an aircraft carrier -- Liaoning, China's refurbished, former Ukrainian flattop, which commissioned in 2012.
The second carrier Shandong, a slightly-improved copy of Liaoning and China’s first home-built flattop in late 2019 is completing sea trials. Carrier number three, a bigger vessel than Liaoning and Shandong, is under construction in Shanghai. Flattop four presumably would be similar in design to number three.
Liaoning and Shandong both displace around 55,000 tons of water. Their powerplants are non-nuclear and, for launching planes, they feature ramps rather than American-style catapults.
The ramp layout probably limits aircraft to a maximum launch weight of 30 tons, a former Chinese navy source revealed. At that weight, a J-15 carrier fighter cannot carry a full load of fuel and weapons, limiting them to brief fights over short distances.
The third and fourth carriers reportedly will have catapults, allowing them to launch heavier planes including fully-armed fighters and radar-early-warning planes. Beijing’s long-term ambition to develop nuclear-powered flattops are on hold, South China Morning Post explained.
The U.S. Navy possesses 11 nuclear-powered carriers plus nine assault ships that can embark F-35B jump jets. The gap between the Americans’ 20 carriers and China’s possible eventual fleet of four flattops underscores the United States’s decades-long spending advantage.
“Despite China's increase in military spending, the U.S. continues to spend far more money,” MIT Technology Reviewexplained. The U.S. defense budget recently has exceeded $700 billion annually, while China typically spends around $250 billion.
“The size of America's lead in annual military spending obscures just how much this difference has accumulated over the decades,” MIT Technology Review continued.
“More than any other single technology, aircraft carriers enable the American military to project force almost anywhere in the world,” the MIT publication concluded. In that important measure of military might, China is far behind the United States -- and might never catch up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Putin set for landmark Paris talks on Ukraine conflict</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: Russian leader Vladimir Putin will for the first time hold formal talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky over the conflict in Ukraine's east on Monday, in a much-anticipated summit in Paris.
No comprehensive peace deal is expected from the afternoon meeting - mediated by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - but diplomats hope that the exercise will help to boost trust between the two men.
Thousands have been killed and one million have fled their homes since pro-Russia militias in eastern Ukraine launched a bid for independence in 2014 - kicking off a conflict that deepened Russia's estrangement from the West.
The separatists seized control of Donetsk and Lugansk regions shortly after Russia's annexation of Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula.
Diplomats have emphasised that the issue of Crimea - a seizure that gave Putin a popularity boost but led to international sanctions being imposed - is not on the table at the summit.
Kiev has made clear its determination to never give up the peninsula, which the international community still regards as part of Ukraine.
The Kremlin has sent signals that it is ready to work with Zelensky, who Putin has described as "likeable" and "sincere".
But Putin also will not want to return empty-handed and will be pushing for an easing of sanctions.
"PROBLEM OF TRUST"
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Funke newspaper group ahead of the summit "we have to do everything we can ... to make progress in the Ukrainian peace process", and described the conflict as "a festering wound in Europe".
Maas praised Zelensky for bringing "new momentum" to the talks, adding that "to make progress with the next difficult steps, Russia needs to make a move too".
The goals of Monday's meeting include agreeing to disband illegal militias, the departure of foreign fighters from Donetsk and Lugansk and Ukraine taking back control over its border with Russia, according to a French presidential source.
"There remains the problem of trust between the parties. This needs to be created before we can move forward," said the source, who asked not to be named.
Also key is agreeing a calendar for elections to be held in Donetsk and Lugansk under Ukrainian law with the two regions enjoying special status - an idea known as the Steinmeier Formula.
"If the summit meeting is to be meaningful, it should have a result, and the result should very much be on the Steinmeier Formula," said Gerhard Mangott, professor of international relations at Austria's Innsbruck University.
"It remains to be seen whether Ukraine is willing to give up some of its pre-conditions for implementing the Steinmeier Formula."
"WOUND OF WAR"
Monday's meeting is the first such summit in three years and seeks to implement accords signed in Minsk in 2015 that call for the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the restoration of Kiev's control over its borders, wider autonomy, and the holding of local elections.
The French presidential source said it was not just Putin's strategic calculations that had impeded the implementation of the Minsk accords but also the "difficulties in Ukraine due to public opinion, divisions and the fundamental wound caused by the war."
The summit is a hugely delicate event for everyone involved, but particularly for Zelensky, who is under pressure not to cede ground to the Kremlin.
For Macron, the summit is a centrepiece of an increasingly bold foreign policy he is driving despite troubles at home, where transport workers have been on strike for days in a dispute over pension reforms.
Macron, who shocked NATO allies this year by declaring the alliance brain dead, has made clear his belief that Europe needs a strategic partnership with Russia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Day 5 of public transport chaos as French strike bites</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: French commuters and tourists braced for a fifth day of public transport chaos Monday (Dec 9) as the government prepared to respond to widespread anger over pension reform that has sparked open-ended walkouts.
President Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and senior cabinet ministers met late Sunday to discuss the contentious reform, which the country's powerful labour unions claim will force many to work longer for a smaller retirement payout.
As both the government and unions vowed to stand firm, businesses started counting the costs of the strike which began last Thursday when some 800,000 people took to the streets across France in a mass rejection of plans to introduce a single, points-based pension scheme, unifying 42 existing plans.
The stoppages stranded commuters, closed schools, and hit tourism and Christmas retail.
Many people opted to take days off or to work from home, but thousands had no choice but to squeeze into perilously overcrowded suburban trains and metros whose numbers were slashed to a minimum.
The biggest labour unrest in years came as France's economy is already dented by more than a year of weekly anti-government demonstrations by so-called "yellow vest" activists protesting unemployment and waning spending power.
Many are opposed to Macron's plans for putting the country on a solid economic footing, of which the retirement overhaul forms a major part.
RETAILERS IN "JEOPARDY"
Business owners fear for their bottom line, with concerns over delivery of goods if the strike continues, and client numbers dwindling at the height of the Christmas shopping season.
On Thursday and Friday, strikers blocked several fuel depots around France, causing long petrol station queues as worried motorists stocked up.
The first day of the stoppage already caused an average 30 per cent drop in sales, according to the Alliance of Commerce which represents 27,000 supermarkets and clothing and shoe stores with almost 200,000 workers.
The Union of Local Enterprises warned that prolonged unrest "could be fatal for many" small businesses.
A hotel association said reservations in the larger Paris region dropped by 30-40 per cent on the first day of the strike.
But it was not only local travel that was affected. Regional and international trains, including the Thalys and Eurostar, were also hobbled by the unrest, and several flights were cancelled on the first days of the strike.
The chaos was set to continue on Monday, with the three main rail unions calling for industrial action to be stepped up ahead of another general strike and mass protests on Tuesday.
"In the coming days, we recommend avoiding public transport," said the website of the RATP train, tram, bus and metro company on which some 10 million passengers in larger Paris area rely daily to get to work.
Trains connecting the suburbs to the centre of Paris will only have a third to half of the normal number of trains running at peak hours Monday, the company said.
Ten out of the RATP's 16 metro lines will be shut, four will offer limited services, and only the two driverless lines will run as scheduled, but with a "risk of congestion" during peak hours.
All 14 metro lines that rely on drivers were closed on Sunday.
Inter-city rail operator SNCF warned of potentially "dangerous" overcrowding, with availability reduced to about 15-20 per cent.
Travel will be "extremely complicated," said SNCF spokeswoman Agnes Ogier, urging commuters to make other arrangements, including carpooling. She did not expect any improvement by Tuesday.
Two-thirds to three-quarters of high-speed international trains will run as scheduled.
The capital's main roads, meanwhile, were expected to be more congested than usual as many non-striking workers opt to drive to work.
A week of conflict likely lies ahead, with Jean-Paul Delevoye, whom Macron appointed to lead the pension reform project, set to unveil the outcome of his months-long consultations on Monday, followed by Philippe announcing the final details of the proposed reform plan on Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: How govt proposes to regulate the dismantling of ships</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Explained Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:10:02 pm
The ship-recycling industry is a labour-intensive sector, the release said, and is susceptible to concerns on environmental safety.
Lok Sabha last week (on December 3) passed The Recycling of Ships Bill, 2019, which seeks to restrict the use of hazardous material on ships, and regulates the recycling of ships.
The Bill, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet on November 20, was introduced in Parliament by Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh L Mandaviya on November 25.
A government release issued at the time the Bill was cleared by the Cabinet pointed out that India is the leader in the global ship recycling industry, with a share of over 30% of the market.
As per the Review of Maritime Transport, 2018 report published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in 2017, India demolished 6,323 tonnes of known ship scrapping worldwide.
The ship-recycling industry is a labour-intensive sector, the release said, and is susceptible to concerns on environmental safety.
The Bill restricts and prohibits the use or installation of hazardous material, irrespective of whether a ship is meant for recycling or not.
For new ships, the restrictions/prohibitions will come into effect along with the law (when notified). Existing ships will have five years to comply with the requirements of the law.
According to a note on the Bill prepared by PRS Legislative Research, the Bill will apply to:
(i) any new or existing ship which is registered in India,
(ii) ships entering a port or terminal in India, or the territorial waters of India,
(iii) any warship, or other ship owned and operated by an administration and used on government non-commercial service, and
(iv) ship recycling facilities operating in India.
The Bill defines this as the dismantling of a ship at a designated facility in order to recover its components and materials for reuse, and taking care of the hazardous material so produced.
Ship recycling includes associated operations such as storage and treatment of materials and components on site, the PRS note says.
Under the proposed law, ships will be recycled only in authorised recycling facilities. An application to authorise such a facility must be submitted to the Competent Authority notified by the central government, along with a ship recycling facility management plan and the prescribed fee.
All existing ship recycling facilities will be required to apply for authorisation within 60 days of the commencement of the Act. The certificate of authorisation will be valid for a period as specified, but not exceeding five years, according to the PRS note.

The Supreme Court on Monday partially lifted its ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR, allowing work from 6 am to 6 pm, even as the air quality in the national capital remained in the “very poor” category for the sixth consecutive day.
Taking into account the report of the Central Pollution Control Board, the Supreme Court permitted construction activities during the day but the ban would be enforced during the night.
The apex court also directed Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh to submit a report on the stubble burning in each state by December 11.
On the other hand, the Centre told the apex court they have set up a high-level committee, in association with IIT, to examine the use of technology like smog towers to combat pollution.
Earlier in November, the apex court imposed a ban on all kinds of construction work in view of the rising pollution levels in the national capital. The apex court had said dust emanating from construction sites was one of the major internal contributors to air pollution in the capital. The court also said that a fine of Rs 1 lakh would be imposed on those violating the order.
The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) had imposed a partial ban on construction activities during October 26-30 between 6 pm and 6 am as a measure to control deteriorating air quality, which had reached emergency levels on November 3.
Since October 30, the EPCA, advised by a task force led by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), has been extending the ban. From November 1 to 5, a complete ban was ordered by EPCA until the Supreme Court, on November 4, directed that all construction activities in Delhi-NCR be stopped until further orders.
This is the longest that a construction ban, a pollution control measure under the Graded Response Action Plan, has been enforced in winter months for the past few years. Last year the ban was imposed from November 1-12. In 2017, it was for an eight-day period from November 8.
On November 30, the apex court had made an exception on its ban on construction activity for the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) at Pragati Maidan.
Delhi-NCR witnessed one of the worst episodes of smog this year, with AQI hovering between 490 and 500. Schools were directed to remain shut in view of the rising pollution, and the Delhi government’s odd-even scheme was also brought into force.

UN experts and activists say China has detained possibly 1 million Uighurs in mass detention camps in Xinjiang. China says the camps are part of an anti-terror crackdown and are providing vocational training.
The counter-terrorism measures in Xinjiang are no different from anti-terrorism measures in the United States, Xinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir told reporters in Beijing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Bill on Xinjiang violates international law, region's governor says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING: Recent US legislation on Xinjiang is a severe violation of international law and gross interference in China's internal affairs, the governor of the far western region said on Monday (Dec 9), accusing the United States of launching a smear campaign.
Tension has flared in recent weeks between China and the United States over issues such as Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority and protesters in Hong Kong, complicating prospects for a near-term deal to end a 17-month long trade war.
Last week, the US House of Representatives passed a Bill requiring a tougher response to Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority. UN experts and activists say China has detained possibly 1 million Uighurs in camps in Xinjiang.
China, which has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs, says the camps are part of an anti-terror crackdown and provide vocational training.
The counter-terrorism measures in Xinjiang are no different from anti-terrorism measures in the United States, the region's governor, Shohrat Zakir, told reporters in Beijing.
The United States has chosen to turn a blind eye to Xinjiang's social stability, and is launching a smear campaign against the region and using issues there to sow discord among ethnic groups in China, he added.
Any attempt to disable Xinjiang is doomed to fail, said Zakir, who is also deputy secretary of the Xinjiang Communist Party.
Human rights groups and former detainees have said conditions in the camps are poor, with inmates subject to psychological and physical abuse.
At Zakir's news conference in the Chinese capital, images of past violence were displayed in excerpts from an English-language documentary, Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang, aired on China's state broadcaster CGTN.
The Uighur Bill, which was passed 407-1 in the Democratic-controlled House, requires the US president to condemn abuses against Muslims and calls for the closure of the camps in Xinjiang.
It also calls on President Donald Trump to impose sanctions for the first time on a member of China's powerful politburo, Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo.

Introducing the Bill, Mr. Shah said the Congress “divided” the country on the basis of religion that is why it was necessary to bring the Bill.
Mr. Shah said the proposed legislation is being brought on the basis of reasonable classifications provided under the Constitution and it does not violate any of its provisions.
The Bill, he said, seeks to give Indian nationality to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who are facing religious persecution there.

The Home Minister said laws were framed to give citizenship to people on several occasions in the past, including in 1971 after the creation of Bangladesh and attacks on Indians in Uganda, by using the provision of reasonable classifications.
“This bill is not even .001 per cent against minorities. It is against infiltrators,” he said.
Earlier, opposition leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Saugata Roy, N.K. Premchandran, Gaurav Gogoi, Shashi Tharoor, Asaduddin Owaisi opposed the introduction of the Bill, saying it was violative of various provisions of the Constitution, including move to grant citizenship on the basis on religion.
The Bill was introduced after a division of votes for which 293 MPs voted in favour and 82 voted against.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quarrying poses threat to hundreds of fossil tree trunks in Thiruvakkarai</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of fossil tree trunks dating back to the prehistoric period and abundantly found in Kadagampattu and villages abutting the country’s first National Fossil Wood Park in Thiruvakkarai, are turning into dust and being used for laying roads due to unbridled quarrying of red laterite soil.
Indiscriminate quarrying has changed the landscape in Kadagampattu, destroying hundreds of fossils ranging from 10 to 30 metres in length. The rock formations that preserve imprints of fossils dating back to the Meso-Proterozoic period have been pockmarked with huge craters, which stand testimony to the extent of quarrying.
M. Sonnert, a naturalist, first documented the existence of fossilised wood in Thiruvakkarai in 1781. The tree trunks were brought inland by rivers during floods and deposited in the water bodies along with sediments about 20 million years ago.
According to the Geological Survey of India, on burial due to the putrefaction processes, the organic matter was replaced with silica, retaining the original structures such as annular rings and tree trunk nodes.
“Countless fossilised tree trunks are spread over an area of about 247 acres in the villages surrounding the National Fossil Food Park. Some are 30 metres in length and 1.5 metres in diameter. Only a few were collected and lie haphazardly in the park. Many other fossilised woods have not even been brought into the park enclosure,” said Ko. Senguttuvan, coordinator of Nadunaatu Centre for History and Cultural Research.
Mr. Senguttuvan pointed out that more than eight quarries, a few of them, illegal were functioning in Kadagampattu and Thollamur villages. Instead of protecting the site, the administration has given licenses to several crushing units and the companies have been indiscriminately plundering the rock formations into chips for laying roads.
“We did a survey of the area and found that the fossilised remains have also been used on the Villupuram-Vikravandi railway line and dumped on both sides of the Villupuram-Tiruchy national highway,” he added.
According to N. Ilango, Head of the Department of Tamil, Tagore Arts College, “The fossils in the present site are being destroyed largely due to people’s ignorance and greed coupled with lack of knowledge of history. The fossils found in Thiruvakkarai provide an accurate record of the prehistoric period and it is highly unfortunate that this national treasure trove is being destroyed instead of being protected.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Todd McClay - Workplace Relations and Safety
9 December 2019
Emboldened unions and increased strike action is disrupting the daily lives of New Zealanders as a result of this Government’s reforms to employment law, National’s Workplace Relations spokesperson Todd McClay says.
“Today, tens of thousands of Mums and Dads across Auckland are being held up in traffic trying to drop their kids off at school and get to work because negotiations with the Union representing bus drivers in Auckland have failed.
“Aucklanders are already facing high fuel taxes, no new roads, delayed promises for new public transport, and now their buses are off the roads as well.
“This is not the first time Aucklanders have been frustrated by strike action.
“Over the last two years there have been more strikes in the transport sector alone than there was under nine years of a National Government. This is down to Labour’s Union friendly employment law reforms emboldening strike action across the country.
“The number of strikes we are seeing also shows why the plan for Union-led sector agreements would fail to deliver better outcomes. These pay agreements harm the economy by imposing new and high costs on businesses.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Todd McClay - Workplace Relations and Safety
9 December 2019
Emboldened unions and increased strike action is disrupting the daily lives of New Zealanders as a result of this Government’s reforms to employment law, National’s Workplace Relations spokesperson Todd McClay says.
“Today, tens of thousands of Mums and Dads across Auckland are being held up in traffic trying to drop their kids off at school and get to work because negotiations with the Union representing bus drivers in Auckland have failed.
“Aucklanders are already facing high fuel taxes, no new roads, delayed promises for new public transport, and now their buses are off the roads as well.
“This is not the first time Aucklanders have been frustrated by strike action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finland's Sanna Marin set to become the world’s youngest Prime Minister at 34 - but who has slipped down the list?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 34-year-old transport minister is set to become Finland’s youngest prime minister ever and its third female government leader.
Finland’s ruling Social Democratic Party council voted 32-29 to name Sanna Marin over rival Antti Lindtman to take over the government’s top post from incumbent Antti Rinne.
Having emerged as Finland’s largest party in the April election, the Social Democrats can appoint one of their own to the post of prime minister in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million.
According to Finland’s biggest newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and the Ilta-Sanomat tabloid, Ms Marin will become the world’s youngest sitting prime minister.
Ms Marin has pushed a few familiar faces down the list with her appointment.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk
Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk was elected last year and is just a year older than the new Finnish leader.
Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-Un
Kim Jong-Un stepped up to the role of leader after his father Kim Jong-Il died in 2011.
The 36-year-old was given the title of 'The Great Successor' and is only the 3rd Supreme Leader of North Korea.
President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele
Salvadorian politician Nayib Bukele came into office in early 2019, winning over half the votes.
President Bukele is only 38-years-old.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
Jacinda Ardern became New Zealand's 40th Prime Minister when she was elected in 2017 and the country's first prime minister to be pregnant in office.
The 39 year-old is currently the 5th youngest leader sitting in office.
Ms Marin has been the Social Democrats' vice chairwoman, a lawmaker since 2015 and served until this week as the minister for transport and communications.
As Finland currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency until the end of the year, politicians are likely to approve the appointment of Ms Marin and her new government quickly so she can represent Finland at the December 12-13 EU leaders’ summit in Brussels.
Mr Rinne stepped down on Tuesday after a key coalition partner, the Centre Party, withdrew its support, citing lack of trust.
Mr Rinne’s has been criticised for his leadership skills prior to a nationwide two-week strike by the state-owned postal service Posti.
The strikes spread to other industries, including the national flag carrier Finnair.
Mr Rinne’s resignation prompted the formal resignation of a coalition of the Social Democrats and the Centre Party and three junior partners: the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland.
The Social Democrats and the four other coalition parties said they are committed to the government programme agreed upon after the April election and will continue in Ms Marin’s new government.
The new government will still have a comfortable majority of 117 seats at the 200-seat Eduskunta (parliament).
The Social Democrats said they are seeking to have Mr Rinne, a former trade union leader, become the parliament’s vice speaker.
He also plans to stay on as the Social Democrats’ chairman until a party congress next summer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With no hangman in Tihar, where the death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya rape-and-murder case are lodged, the jail authorities have approached other prisons in the country to provide them with a hangman, sources said.
They said informal talks are underway with Uttar Pradesh prison authorities.
The Union Home Ministry on Friday recommended President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy plea filed by Vinay Sharma, one of the convicts facing the gallows for the rape and murder of the 23-year-old paramedic student.
A day later, Sharma withdrew his plea, saying it was sent without his consent.
Nirbhaya was gang-raped on Dec 16, 2012. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Singapore. The brutality of the rape had shocked the nation and triggered massive protests.
The Supreme Court on Dec 12, 2018, dismissed a PIL seeking direction to the Centre to execute the death penalty awarded to four convicts Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay and Akshay in the case.
Located in West Delhi, Tihar jail is the biggest prison in the country and has had high-profile inmates. Former Union minister P Chidambaram was lodged there for 106 days and was released after the Supreme Court granted him bail last week.
The 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was the last person hanged in the prison. He was hanged by a Tihar jail personnel in Feb 2013.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General News
Written By Suchitra Karthikeyan | Mumbai | Updated On: December 09, 2019 10:18 IST
With the recent national outrage over the Hyderabad gangrape and the Unnao rape victim attack, the demand for speedy hanging of the convicts of the Nirbhaya rape case has been rising. Amid this demand, Tihar Jail officials have reiterated that they currently do not have a hangman. Officials added that they will procure one from another state when needed.
Convict in Nirbhaya case petitions the President seeking withdrawal of mercy plea
Currently, one of the convicts in the Nirbhaya rape case - Vinay Sharma, is seeking a withdrawal of the mercy petition which was sent to the President by Union Home Ministry, saying that it wasn't signed and authorized by him. Previously, the Union Ministry and the Delhi government had recommended rejecting his mercy petition. All four convicts in the Nirbhaya case are lodged in India's biggest jail - Tihar.

Meanwhile, India's last official hangman was Nata Mallick - who executed the hanging of Dhananjay Chatterjee in 2004 at Alipur Central jail, as per reports. Reports state that while Mallick has seen over a hundred men sent to the death row, he has hanged only one - Dhannajay Chatterjee. Chatterjee who never confessed to raping and murdering a teenage girl was hanged in 2004 after his mercy petition was rejected by former president A.P.J Abdul Kalam.

Soon, one of India's few registered hangmen - Pawan Kumar applied to be Tihar's next hangman. While there have been three executions since 2011- Kumar is still waiting for his first execution. Kasab's execution which was done on November 2012, was carried out by a police constable in the Pune's Yerwada jail.

Similarly in 2013, when the 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru's mercy plea was rejected by former President Pranab Mukherjee, there was a need for a hangman. But as the government decided to conduct his hanging in secrecy, the identity of the hangman is unknown. He was hanged on 9 February 2013 at Tihar jail. Meanwhile, the same constable who hanged Ajmal Kasab was tapped to hang 1993 Bombay blast convict Yakub Memon at Nagpur Central jail on 30 July 2015.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The capital punishment to the four culprits of the heinous 2012 Delhi gangrape case has once again come under a cloud of doubt as one of the convicts is ready to file a review petition against his death sentence.
Akshay Thakur will file his review petition in Supreme Court, a few days after the home ministry recommended President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy plea filed by another accused Vinay Kumar.
The SC has already rejected a similar plea filed by Vinay Kumar, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta.
If the SC dismisses Akshay Thakur's review petition, he will have the option to file a mercy plea with the president.
Six people were convicted of brutally raping a 23-year-old paramedic student now known as Nirbhaya while she was on her way back home on December 16, 2012. Nirbhaya later died of her injuries.
The gangrape sparked a nationwide fury, which led to new legislation to deal with such heinous crimes.
The six involved were arrested and convicted. One was minor and another, Ram Singh, committed suicide in Tihar Jail during trial.

According to the ombudswoman, she maintains contacts with her Greek counterpart, Andreas Pottakis, and Vinnik's lawyer to monitor the issues related to the Russian national's detention and condition.
Vinnik was detained in Greece in July 2017 at the request of US authorities on various charges, including laundering $4 billion through bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange BTC-E, allegedly headed by him. The Russian national has denied the accusations. Russia, where he is wanted for separate fraud charges, and France also seek his extradition.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finland Addresses Sex Change Regret as Gender Reassignment Soars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over the past 15 years, the number of Finns seeking sexual reassignment has grown 20-fold. De-transitioning has been described as a physically and mentally challenging procedure with some of the effects being irreversible.
Helsinki University Hospital will conduct a study to map out the number of people who have second thoughts after undergoing gender reassignment and request a reversal amid transitioning procedures, national broadcaster Ylereported.
The idea is that the chart of de-transitioned patients will help prevent transition regrets amid an elevated demand for gender reassignment procedures. Over the past decade, the number of people seeking gender reassignment in the western world in general has spiked,  and Finland is no exception.
In Finland, gender identity clinics are run by the Tampere and Helsinki University Hospitals. Between 2003 and 2007, around 20 people a year were admitted for gender reassignment. In the past few years, though, their numbers have soared to several hundred annually. In 2018, doctors referred 400 people to these programmes, which determine the need for medical internvention.
“About half of people come in with a trans diagnosis”, Niina Puustinen of Helsinki University’s gender identity clinic told Yle.
According to deputy chief doctor Katinka Tuisku from the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS), no official records on how many people have de-transitioned are currently maintained.
Twenty-seven year-old Nita, who underwent a medical female-to-male transition, is one of those who regretted the step. By her own admission, she is not alone in having launched the de-transitioning process. She complained to Yle that her mental health issues and the roots of her body dysmorphia were not adequately addressed before the transition.
According to Nita, she approached it too lightly, somewhat like getting a tattoo. After taking the male hormone testosterone and having her breasts removed, she thought the better of it, only to discover that some effects are irreversible and that she'd become “a 27-year-old woman who sounds like a teenage boy”.
By contrast, others, such as Tanja von Knorring of the Finnish association for transgender and intersex rights (Trasek), believe that Finland's approach to gender reassignment is too strict. Von Knorring argued that Finnish doctors are “too careful”, which causes a lot of young people to feel unwell.
The results of the study will be published next year.
Earlier, a Swedish survey indicated that 2.2 percent of patients had their gender correction process undone. The estimate is based on the number of people who applied to restore their original legal gender.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson Takes Aim at Pro-Brexit Labour Seats Across UK in Last Push Before National Vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Polling stations across Britain will open on 12 December, with voters expected to throw their weight behind one of the listed candidates. The biggest stumbling block still surrounds how they (and their electorate) view Britain’s future in or outside the EU.
With three days to go before the national vote, the Tories are hoping to win longstanding Labour constituencies that were strictly in favour of leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum – predominantly in the Midlands and northern England, including in Humber, Sunderland etc., the BBC reported citing the party.
In a speech in Sunderland, 61 percent of which cast their votes for Brexit, the prime minister is expected to shift his focus to the way “the Labour party has let you down most of all", the edition notes, adding Johnson will most certainly attack Parliament saying it has “delayed” and “denied” Brexit.
"It's now been 1,264 days since Sunderland's roar was heard on the night of 23 June 2016", Johnson is expected to say, before proceeding to attack the Parliament:
Johnson will also set out to southwest England, targeting the pro-Lib Dem voters.
The Conservative Party says the geography of the prime minister’s business trip is indeed vast as he is intending to "visit every region in England and Wales" in the final three days before polling day on Thursday.
Johnson "will be visiting high streets, businesses, pubs and markets across England and Wales", telling voters that "the only way they can get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential" is to vote Conservative, the party added.
‘Ending Austerity’ or Ushering in Second Brexit Vote?
Labour, meanwhile, is reportedly focusing on finance-related matters, vowing to deliver an appropriate budget to "end austerity", according to the promises John McDonnell is expected to make in a speech about the party's priorities for its potential first 100 days in government.
The Lib Dems appear to be doubling down on their anti-Brexit rhetoric, as the party is expected to promise effective legislation to stop Brexit immediately after the general election. They are pledging to introduce two draft bills they say would pave the way for another EU referendum.
The first would reportedly enable the Electoral Commission to start consultations over a referendum question, while the second one would set up a referendum on the currently approved Brexit deal, with the second option of remaining in the EU.
Tax Dilemma
There is one common theme in the three parties’ agendas: they all say they would take advantage of low interest rates to take out bank loans to heavily invest in infrastructure.
Labour and the Lib Dems would also increase the corporate tax, while the Conservatives have scrapped a planned rate cut for it.
In general, Labour is planning to increase taxes on the top 5% of earners, those taking home £80,000 a year or more, while the Conservatives vow to freeze National Insurance, income tax, and VAT rates.
Brits will go to polls this Thursday, 12 December. Following the recent last pre-election debate between the two top candidates to occupy 10 Downing – Johnson and Corbyn - Pollster YouGov released a “snap poll”. The UK-based data analytics firm posed the following question: "Leaving aside your own party preferences, who do you think performed best overall in tonight’s debate?”
According to their results, Johnson came out on top during the debate, albeit with a slim margin.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amid Internet Shutdown in Jammu, Government Employee Caught Making Money Off Water Bills</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi (Sputnik): India's newly-formed union territory Jammu and Kashmir remains cut off from the world as internet, telephone, and mobile services were shut down in the area in August. The Indian government has been receiving international condemnation for the communications clampdown in the area.
An employee frm the Public Health Engineering (PHE) department in Jammu has made about $2,038,692 amid an internet shutdown in the area. The internet has been shut down in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution on 5 August, due to "security concerns".
In the absence of internet connectivity, several public utility services have been affected, forcing people to queue up at the offices of these utilities to pay for services. People could not pay their water bills online and so it was being collected in cash. The field staff of the PHE department had collected around $2,038,692 but the amount was not deposited in the treasury.
An internal investigation of the department revealed that the cashier had pocketed the money rather than depositing it in the treasury. Following this, a complaint was filed against the employee with the police. An police investigation has now been initiated into the matter, according to authorities.
Field staff had submitted the amount to cashier as a routine procedure and the cashier even gave them a receipt of submission. However, the matter came to fore when senior employees did not receive the payment of bills. 
While telephone services resumed in phases just days after the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in the valley, post-paid mobile phone calling services only resumed on 12 October and pre-paid connections as well as SMS services remain barred. Internet service is partly available to a select group of people, on request.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A drunken raccoon entertained people at a Christmas market in the German city of Erfurt on Saturday. The poor animal apparently indulged in too much mulled wine, and was barely able to stan.
The creature was not afraid of people at all, and the rescue services, who arrived at the site easily picked the poor guy up and put it in a cage, so the animal could sober up a bit. It tried to fight back, however, but was simply too inebriated to do something serious.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chairman of Republicans in Israel: Trump Frustrated with Lack of Government in Israel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Only two days are left for Israel's parliament, the Knesset, to put forward a candidate that will be able to form a government. Otherwise, the Knesset will dissolve itself, prompting another general vote, the third in under a year.
Israelis are tired of the political deadlock, but they are not alone, with reports suggesting that US President Donald Trump is feeling equally frustrated with the lack of a government in Jerusalem.
But Marc Zell, the vice president of Republicans Overseas, a political organisation - created in 2013 - for US citizens living outside of the United States, says the president's frustration is not directed at any specific individual or a party but rather at the situation itself.
Trump announced his intention to introduce a peace plan that would put an end to a decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians back in February but two election campaigns in Israel - and a third just around the corner - pushed the revelation of the plan to the indefinite future.
Despite the fact that the details of the plan are yet to be announced, the initiative presupposes a US investment of $50 billion in the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for peace with Israel. It also suggests that the West Bank and Gaza will be recognised as an autonomy - not an independent Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, something that was met with praise by Israelis and antagonism by Palestinians.
According to a poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, more than 80 percent of those asked rejected the plan with only 5 percent accepting it without reservation.
That, however, didn't stop the Trump administration from continuing its efforts in pushing ahead with the plan, trying to convince Middle East leaders to express their support for the initiative.
For Zell the Palestinian reluctance to accept Trump's initiative was just another reminder that "Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity". 
But that has not always been the case. In 2011, for example, the Obama administration was pushing Prime Minister Netanyahu to sit down for talks with the Palestinians in an attempt to reach a deal but the premier rejected those efforts causing frustration in Washington.
Zell, who believes those days are gone, says Palestinians have no other option but to change their ways.
"First of all, President Trump has recognised that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is no longer central to the geo-political stability in the Middle East, and, secondly, he brought about the alignment of forces in the Middle East, creating a situation where Arab countries that had previously no relations with Israel start cooperating with the Jewish state", he concluded, expressing hope that this tendency will continue.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EAST FLATBUSH, Brooklyn (WABC) -- An off-duty officer is due in court after he was arrested and charged in a deadly two-car crash in Brooklyn.
It happened early Sunday morning at East 55th and Foster Avenue in East Flatbush.
A black Mazda SUV was T-boned by a high-end Nissan GTR driven by 47-year-old off-duty NYPD Officer Rohan Shaw.
He's now charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, a speed violation and driving while ability impaired, which is a lesser charge than DWI.
The driver of the Mazda SUV took off.
A 22-year-old woman in the SIV was taken to Kings County Hospital in serious condition and another passenger, 23-year-old Joanna Dixon died.
"She does a lot of volunteer work and she's always an outgoing person," Dixon's friend said. "Outgoing personality, she's belongs to a volunteer organization, very outgoing and has a lot of potential of being career-oriented."
Friends and family left candles and flowers to remember her.
Shaw is due in court in Brooklyn later Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joshua v Ruiz does little to gloss over fight for rights in Saudi Arabia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As Saturday night spilled into Sunday morning in Saudi Arabia, something unusual happens. The shrieking bass line of House of Pain’s Jump Around starts pumping out across the Diriyah stadium, where Anthony Joshua’s heavyweight showdown against Andy Ruiz Jr is about to begin. A few people stand up. Then several more. And suddenly hundreds of men and women in traditional dress are pogoing and waving their hands in delirium.
This, to put it mildly, is not something one expects to see in a country that is a byword for patriarchy and religious extremism. But when I speak to one local, he tells me this is another sign of the dizzying change of the past two years. “Although I agree a lot of bad things are still happening, it is improving,” he says. “In 10 years’ time we won’t be living in the same place.”
The heir to the Saudi throne, Mohammad bin Salman, watches the fight on a private terrace. And afterwards Joshua takes care to thank his team, his opponent – and then, gazing upwards to Salman, gives him a fist-pump. The crown prince responds with a pump of his own.
But here is a more sober story, also from last week. A female friend from Britain wants a swim, only to be told that her hotel pool is exclusively for men, except between 7pm and 8pm. Most gyms, meanwhile, are out of bounds for women. Then there is the recent Human Rights Watch report detailing another side of Saudi Arabia, including mass arrests and detention, a crackdown on dissent and free speech and jailing of the country’s most prominent women’s rights advocates, including Loujain al-Hathloul, who called for women to be able to drive.
And that is before we get to the beheadings, or the murder by a 15-man Saudi hit squad of the prominent critic Jamal Khashoggi , who was probably drugged and asphyxiated, then dismembered and stuffed into bags last year. The winds of change are blowing in Saudi Arabia. The trick is trying to decipher in which direction.
Sport is a growing part of this, of course. Soon the Spanish Super Cup between Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Valencia will take place in Jeddah, with the clubs splitting around €40m. In February the Saudi Cup will become the world’s richest horse race with prize money of €18m. Many more events are in the pipeline.
Of course the Saudis are doing this partly to sportswash their dubious rights record. It would be foolish to suggest otherwise. But locals and foreigners working here insist it is true that the regime’s Vision 2030 plan has led to significant if modest changes, including more women doing sport, being allowed to drive and leave the country without their guardian’s permission.
True, a pungent whiff of misogyny remains. Most women still feel compelled to wear long black abaya robes or the burka in public and may train only in female-only gyms. But socially things do seem different from in 2016, when 6,000 Saudi women responded to New York Times to outline their frustrations.
The response of one 24-year-old woman was typical. “We’re not allowed to even go to the supermarket without permission or a companion, and that’s a simple thing on the huge, horrendous list of rules we have to follow,” she wrote. Another was just as blunt. “The male guardianship makes my life like a hell!! We want to hang out with our friends, go and have lunch outside. I feel hopeless.”
When it comes to other freedoms, including political expression, the voices I speak to are less optimistic. Last week when I asked the Saudi sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, about Amnesty International’s criticisms, he replied: “We don’t want to impose anything we can get a backlash from, that could reflect negatively around us. But change is happening and it will come.”
I doubt if I could have asked such a question if I was a Saudi. After all, the regime has arrested several journalists in the past month.
Another local I spoke to hoped that the lack of free speech was being used to control not only voices for democracy but powerful conservative clerics kicking up a fuss about the reforms. “Eventually they will have to create institutions that can govern apart from the royal family,” he continued, his voice carrying more hope than expectation.
For now, though, the best sport can do is shout about the issues whenever it visits countries like Saudi Arabia and China. As Human Rights Watch puts it: “Increased pressure from fans and consumers would also raise the bar for human rights.”
In January more than a dozen women drivers will take part in the Dakar Rally. Any journalist present should be questioning why Saudi women’s rights activists who fought for the right to drive in Saudi Arabia remain banned from travel, on trial or behind bars.
And when it comes to sportswashing, Human Rights Watch also has some salient advice. “Instead of using sports to rehabilitate its global image, it would be cheaper and easier for Saudi Arabia to simply undertake fundamental human rights reforms and respect the basic rights of its citizens in order to improve its image and standing in the world.”
Whatever you made of Joshua v Ruiz II coming to Diriyah, it is surely impossible to argue with that. – Guardian

    <h5 class="mb-1">Significant gender pay gap still evident at Solihull Council</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fresh figures show Solihull Council is still grappling with a sizeable gender pay gap, despite some improvement in this year's statistics.
In 2018/19, the numbers revealed that Solihull had the widest gulf of all seven West Midlands councils.
And while the figures for 2019/20 show that the average gap was shrinking based on key measures, both the median and mean are still above what the other six local authorities reported in the previous 12 months.
At a meeting this week, council officers credited a "bottom-loaded" pay increase for reducing the mean to 15.2 per cent (down 4.2) and the median to 25.1 (down 1.6).
It remains to be seen what ground Solihull has made up on its nearest neighbours, with organisations still having several months to publish the latest data.
Karen Grant, the council's head of equality and diversity, told the remuneration committee there should be "some caution" in comparing figures.
"Not in a defensive way, just in terms of the council we recognise that we have a large percentage of women," she said.
75 per cent of the workforce is women and the catering service, which is still provided in-house, is overwhelmingly female. Although Ms Grant said women were also well-represented at senior level (four out of six of the top team).
Cllr Ian Courts, leader of Solihull Council, said he was keen the organisation broke down some of the traditional perceptions about the jobs that are the best fit for different genders.
In response, Adrian Cattell, the head of human resources, said: "Our head of property services is female, two or three years ago we had chef of the year, who was a male, in our catering  service...
"So there are these examples and we do use those as part of the opportunities to attract people into those types of roles, but it is, to be perfectly honest, slow work."
The annual report highlights the difficulties that this can pose.
It said: "Evidence shows that occupational segregation, which is the concentration of men and women in different kinds of jobs, is one of the main reasons of the gender pay gap."
A legal requirement to publish gender pay gap figures was introduced for organisations with 250 or more employees in 2017.
The trade union Unison has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi gunman tweeted against US before naval base shooting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — The Saudi gunman who killed three people at the Pensacola naval base had apparently gone on Twitter shortly before the shooting to blast U.S. support of Israel and accuse America of being anti-Muslim, a U.S. official said Sunday as the FBI confirmed it is operating on the assumption the attack was an act of terrorism.
Investigators are also trying to establish whether the killer, 2nd Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force, acted alone or was part of a larger plot.
Alshamrani, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy during the rampage at a classroom building Friday, was undergoing flight training at Pensacola, where members of foreign militaries routinely receive instruction.
"We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," said Rachel J. Rojas, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Jacksonville.

Authorities believe the gunman made social media posts criticizing the U.S. under a user handle similar to his name, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating whether he authored the words or just posted them, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Also, investigators believe the gunman visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting and are working to determine the purpose of the trip, the official said.
All foreign students at the Pensacola base have been accounted for, no arrests have been made, and the community is under no immediate threat, Rojas said at a news conference. A Saudi commanding officer has ordered all students from the country to remain at one location at the base, authorities said.
"There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation," Rojas said. "The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation."
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the investigation was proceeding under "the presumption that this was an act of terrorism"and he called for better vetting of foreigners allowed into the U.S. for training on American bases.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon, DeSantis also said the gunman had a social media trail and a "deep-seated hatred of the United States."
He said he thought such an attack could have been prevented with better vetting.
"You have to take precautions" to protect the nation, DeSantis said.
"To have this individual be able to take out three of our sailors, to me that's unacceptable," the governor added.
Earlier in the week of the shooting, Alshamrani hosted a dinner party where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, another U.S. official told the AP on Saturday.
Alshamrani used a Glock 9 mm weapon that had been purchased legally in Florida, Rojas said. DeSantis questioned whether foreigners should continue to be allowed under federal law to buy guns in the U.S. and called it a "federal loophole."
Republican DeSantis said he supports that the Second Amendment but that it "does not apply to Saudi Arabians."
Family members and others identified the three dead as Joshua Kaleb Watson, a 23-year-old graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.
In a statement, the FBI confirmed Sunday that it had obtained base surveillance videos as well as cellphone footage taken by a bystander outside the building, and had also interviewed that person.
Rojas would not directly answer when asked whether other students knew about the attack beforehand or whether there was anything "nefarious" about the making of the video. She said that a lot of information needs to be confirmed by investigators and that she did not want to contribute to "misinformation" circulating about the case.
Rojas said federal authorities are focused on questioning the gunman's friends, classmates and other associates. "Our main goal is to confirm if he acted alone or was he part of a larger network," she said.
President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation" that the shooting looked like "terrorism or akin to terrorism." But he cautioned that the FBI was still investigating.
"Look, to me it appears to be a terrorist attack," he said. "I don't want prejudge the investigation, but it appears that this may be someone that was radicalized." O'Brien said he did not see evidence so far of a "broader plot."
The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. More than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the U.S. going through military training.
Foreigners allowed into the U.S. for military training are subject to background checks to weed out security risks.
"This has been done for many decades," Trump said on Saturday. "I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately."
Saudi Arabia's government so far has not commented on a possible motive for the shooting, nor offered any information about the promised investigation.
Meanwhile, the daily Saudi newspaper Okaz published an interview with Othman Alshamrani, a man it described as an extended family member of the shooting suspect from his hometown in the kingdom's Asir province. "This individual act does not represent us, nor his family nor his tribe," the relative said, adding that the slain man was from a family with members who have well served their nation in military posts.
Balsamo reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Lolita Baldor, Ben Fox, and Robert Burns in Washington; Jon Gambrell and Aya Batrawy in Dubai; Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida; and Tamara Lush in Tampa, Florida, contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to restore dropped words in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' quote.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Abe granted brief respite as scandal-hit extraordinary Diet session draws to a close</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year’s extraordinary Diet session came to a close Monday, ending a sitting that has been wracked with problems and scandals since it started in early October.
During the course of the session two ministers resigned, a plan for reforming college English-language tests was withdrawn and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was accused of breaching election campaign laws in relation to a cherry-blossom viewing party hosted each year by the nation’s political leader.
Those scandals encouraged opposition lawmakers to boycott a number of bills, including one that included measures said to make voting in referendums easier and would have been instrumental to delivering constitutional revision.
Failure to enact the referendum bill was particularly damaging for Abe, who has long tried to promote parliamentary debate over his proposal to revise the U.S.-drafted postwar Constitution, said to formalize the legal status of the Self-Defense Forces.
In a news conference later the same day, Abe said it was “very regrettable” that the bill had not been enacted during the session, arguing that the result of the Upper House election in July had suggested a majority of voters wanted the Diet to at least promote debates over constitutional revision.
“The road to constitutional revision is not an easy one, but by all means I myself will carry out (constitutional revision),” Abe stressed, noting that “it is our political responsibility to stick to the promise we made to the people.”
“The LDP will continue to take the initiative to revise the constitution step by step,” he added.
Rather than furthering such debates, discussions during the session had come to focus on the annual budget for the official cherry-blossom viewing party, with opposition lawmakers pointing out that it had nearly doubled over the past six years to hit ¥57.28 million in fiscal 2020.
The revelation raised suspicions that Abe might have taken advantage of the state-funded prestigious event to entertain hundreds of his own supporters as well as those of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The Diet session also revealed that the guest list for this year’s party was shredded on the very day a Diet member requested its release.
Abe’s office was also reported to have organized another private, pre-event party for voters at what was suspected to be massively discounted rates, which opposition lawmakers have claimed was a possible violation of the election campaign law.
The final week of the session proved to be a tug-of-war between the opposition and the ruling bloc, with the opposition suggesting that they would submit a vote of no confidence against Abe, given the way he handled the party scandal.
Abe has, at least, seen success with the Diet’s approval of a bilateral U.S.-Japan trade agreement. While the opposition criticized the deal for giving too much ground to the United States, by lowering tariffs on U.S. agricultural products without a concrete commitment from the U.S. to lower tariffs on Japanese car exports, the bill was passed thanks to the LDP’s majority in the Diet.
The Diet session was a crucial one for Abe’s tenure as prime minister, given that only two years remain until the end of his term as LDP party leader and also his premiership.
But there were problems from the outset. Two weeks into the session, trade minister Isshu Sugawara resigned over allegations he had breached election campaign rules. Then, just a week later, Justice Minister Katsuyuki Kawai resigned, too, following a scoop by a tabloid claiming that his wife — also a politician — had broken the law by paying some of her campaign staff more than the legal limit. When asked about the two resignations, which came in such close succession, Abe acknowledged responsibility, saying that he had been the person who appointed them.
Since then, opposition lawmakers have slammed Abe for not taking any concrete action to atone for making the appointments that lead to the scandals.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Climate change activists wearing gas masks blocked a central London road to demand the next government tackles “deadly levels of air pollution” in the capital.
Six Extinction Rebellion protesters dressed in hi-vis suits glued their hands to yellow breeze-blocks in the middle of Cranbourn Street, outside Leicester Square Tube station.
The demonstration, called The Air We Grieve, involved 25 cement blocks which the activists said represents the number of Londoners who die each day as a result of air pollution.
A van parked sideways next to them was emblazoned with a sign reading: “Air Pollution Kills 25 Londoners Each Day”.
Police later arrived in the street, which protesters said has “dangerously high levels of air pollution”.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: “Police are aware of a small number of protesters outside Leicester Square Underground station.
“Officers are in attendance.”
One protester, teacher Rosamund Frost, said: “We are here demanding action on illegal levels of toxic air in our communities, our schools and our streets.
“In February 2017, the European Commission issued a ‘final warning’ to the UK over illegal levels of air pollution.
“In May that year, after the Government failed to take decisive action, they were taken to Europe’s highest court, the European Court of Justice.
“The Government have neglected to tackle fatal levels of air pollution. How can we put our trust in them to address the broader climate and ecological emergency?”
Meanwhile, other Extinction Rebellion protesters were entering their fourth week on hunger strike outside political party headquarters in Westminster.
The strikers, including 76-year-old grandfather Peter Cole, have sent a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, inviting him to discuss the climate and ecological emergency with them on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Age Year in Review: Call for leadership on the climate crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Political heavyweights at The Age have called for leadership on the climate crisis after years of failures.
Speaking at The Age Live: 2019 Year in Review on Monday night, group executive editor James Chessell said climate change was now the biggest cause for anxiety in the community.
“The political class is failing us on this issue,” Chessell said.
Senior writer Tony Wright said Australians were looking to Parliament for action after weeks of deadly bushfires in NSW and dangerous air pollution in Sydney.
“During these fires, people have been looking for leadership and haven’t found it,” Wright said.
The panel, hosted by national editor Tory Maguire, agreed that climate change had become a toxic political issue.
“We’ve seen this political wrecking ball that’s been climate change policy ... demolish all in front of it,” Chessell said.
Chief political correspondent David Crowe said every party had made mistakes on the issue, including the Greens.
“There’s scar tissue in every party over climate change,” Crowe said.
“Climate change was the issue that broke leadership in the past and could break it again.”
Strengthening the government’s climate policies could pose Prime Minister Scott Morrison “huge political risks within his own party”, Crowe said.
“[Climate change is] just so toxic within that party.”
Last week marked the 10th anniversary of the Rudd Labor government’s failed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), voted down by the Coalition and the Greens, spelling the end for then-prime minister Kevin Rudd.
His successor, Julia Gillard, went onto negotiate a price on carbon but the so-called carbon tax was quickly repealed when the Coalition formed government under Tony Abbott in 2014. In Opposition, Mr Abbott had earlier taken down Malcolm Turnbull as the Liberal leader over his deal to support Mr Rudd’s CPRS.
There are still climate denialists in government, Wright noted, and Labor lost credibility on the debate in the doomed May election by jumping between positions on coal depending on the electorate.
On Monday, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said Australia should not stop exporting coal in order to grapple with the climate crisis.
“We’ve got to consider what the actual outcome is from any proposal, and the proposal that we immediately stop exporting coal would damage our economy and would not have any environmental benefit,” Mr Albanese told The Age.
About 1000 readers packed in the Melbourne Recital Centre in Southbank for the annual Year in Review on Monday night.
Readers applauded when Chessell promised The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald would ramp up its reporting on the climate next year.
Other speakers included business journalist Adele Ferguson, crime reporter John Silvester, investigative journalist Nick McKenzie and investigations editor Michael Bachelard.

    <h5 class="mb-1">False fire cladding claims caught out by regulator's new teeth</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queensland suppliers of timber cladding and aluminium insulation who made false claims about their fire safety have been caught out by the state’s building regulator since it was granted stronger investigative powers.
The supplier of the imported European timber cladding product had claimed it was non-combustible and passed appropriate testing.
However, independent testing carried out by the Queensland Building and Construction Commission’s non-conforming building product unit found the cladding failed the required fire spread test.
The supplier has since withdrawn its fire safety claims, with the QBCC investigating further potential offences.
The details are among a number released by the QBCC three years after new laws - under which the specialist unit was established - were enacted to extend responsibility for building products further along the supply chain.
The regulator has fielded almost two complaints each week since the investigative unit was established in November 2017 - more than 300 in total.
"Before the laws were introduced the lion’s share of the blame lay at the end of the supply chain, with sub-contractors and installers carrying the burden of detecting dodgy products," QBCC commissioner Brett Bassett said in a statement Monday.
"Now, everyone in the supply chain including manufacturers, suppliers, installers and importers are responsible for ensuring building products are safe and fit for their intended purpose."
Another investigation into an aluminium wall and ceiling insulation product found it achieved a much lower fire classification than claimed. That company has since ceased supplying the product.
A garden shed sold to customers in far north Queensland that was promised could withstand winds of up to 147km/h was found to require a separate kit to make it cyclone-resistant - a detail left off the packaging.
Last year, a portable pool fence was recalled nationwide after a QBCC investigation that extended to Victoria.
Mr Bassett said subcontractors installing those products had been misled by the false claims, leading to potentially serious safety risks.
"Penalties for defective or negligent work can range from fines of thousands of dollars to a three-year ban for a first offence," he said.
Anyone with concerns about potentially non-conforming building products can lodge a complaint on the QBCC website.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jack Dikian of Mosman writes: "For those younger readers who might be wondering if, when Santa sets off from the North Pole this Christmas Eve, flying carbon-neutral will be high on his wish list, the Regional Council of Lapland has 'made vital, environmental investments in the age-old practices of reindeer herding to help control the release of harmful greenhouse gases.' Just don’t ask how."
"I have just received a Christmas card from the local funeral director," says David Tarran of Thornleigh. "This is the first time I have received a card from them. Do they know something I don’t know?"
Wrapping up the Chrimbo theme for the day, George Manojlovic of Mangerton notes that "a house up the road has one of those inflatable Santas scaling a wall. Trouble is, he's as limp as boiled spinach. Being on his own, I'd say his reindeer let him down."
In the hope that our current dry spell isn’t the beginning of the end, Manbir Singh Kohli of Pemulwuy writes: “This question has been troubling my innards in this drought. Does toilet paper have a wider water impact compared to the lowly bidet? Perhaps the collective wisdom of C8 will help enlighten me.”
"I apologise for my tardiness in submitting this comment, but I save up my Column 8s to read in one sitting, so some of them are a week or so old," explains Sue Davis of Wamberal. "I have a butcher bird (C8) in my garden who sometimes sings the first line of Old MacDonald Had a Farm. He doesn't do the 'e i e i o' though. Maybe that's just too difficult."
"The smallest inhabited island in Moreton Bay is Karragarra Island where one of Australia's first driverless buses is being trialled," advises Gregory Abbott of Macleay Island (Qld). "First report is that the bus is so friendly it stopped for a leaf and for a butterfly." Must be the sensitive type.
Now a question for those seeking change from Tim Royle of Chatswood: “I keep finding small collections of foreign coins in numerous offshore currencies as a result of both my business and personal travel. Instead of giving to an offshore organisation, I would prefer an Australian-approved charity. So I ask C8 to nominate a qualified Australian charity who will accept my load of assorted foreign coinage. My first choices would be the NSW drought or bushfire-affected areas.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Imran Khan will receive Bahrain's highest civil award, the King Hamad Order of the Renaissance, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis Zulfiqar Bukhari has told Arab News.
"Prime Minister is going on an official visit to Bahrain in mid-December where he will be conferred Bahrain’s highest civilian award," the publication quoted Bukhari in a report published on Saturday. Bukhari added that the premier will receive the award at a special ceremony during his visit to the Gulf nation.
According to Arab News, the award was also conferred upon Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 25, the same month that India revoked the special constitutional status of Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK).
According to diplomatic sources, Prime Minister Imran will leave for Bahrain on December 15 and will attend the Gulf nation's national day celebrations as special guest.
While in Bahrain, Prime Minister Imran will meet Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa and King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the report added.
The premier will also visit Switzerland and Malaysia. In Geneva, he is expected to address a conference on refugees.
In Malaysia, he will attend the first Kuala Lumpur Summit to discuss the ummah's problems. The summit in the Malaysian capital from December 18 to 20 is being attended by Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar in addition to host Malaysia. The event’s theme is 'The Role of Development in Achieving National Sovereignty'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Even Attorney General Barr is reportedly warning Trump to dump Rudy Giuliani</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rudy Giuliani's late-career taste for wealth led him to lucrative foreign consulting work, and those business ties apparently prevented him from becoming secretary of state after he helped get his old friend Donald Trump elected president in 2016, The Washington Post and The New York Times recount. But Giuliani joined the president as an unpaid personal attorney in 2018, the Times adds, and since then, "step by step, he has escorted President Trump to the brink of impeachment."
Without Giuliani's "push for money and frank yearning for relevance, the Trump Ukrainian initiative might never have amounted to much more than presidential tweetstorms," and Trump wouldn't be weeks from impeachment, the Times reports. Yet Giuliani was back in Ukraine last week, still publicly digging for (or trying to will into being) dirt on Democrats. Trump seems on board, but his staunchest allies aren't sure what to make of it.
"It's weird that he's over there," Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) told ABC News This Week on Sunday. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) suggested on CNN that Giuliani "is the president's personal attorney, but I don't know that he's over there on the president's direction. In fact, I would suggest that he's not." Several times "in recent months", Attorney General William Barr "has counseled Trump in general terms that Giuliani has become a liability and a problem for the administration," the Post reports, and at least once he personally "warned the president that he was not being well-served by his lawyer."
In fact, the Post continues, Giuliani's actions have long "caused persistent alarm among Trump's advisers, who worry that it is often not clear who Giuliani is representing — the president, his private clients, or his own foreign policy views — in his meetings at the White House and in foreign cities." Giuliani's "uniquely powerful position" as "unpaid personal counsel to the president and for-profit peddler of access and advice" has led not only to the Ukraine scandal, the Times reports, but also to a wide-ranging criminal investigation by the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office Giuliani used to lead.
The Justice Department, White House, and Giuliani did not respond to the Post's request for comment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ted Odogwu, Kano
Kano State governor, Dr  Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday appointed Emir Mohammed Sanusi, as the pioneer Chairman of the new State Council of Emirs for a period of two years.
The announcement, which came as a surprise has finally put to rest speculations as to who Governor Ganduje will appoint as the Chairman of the Emirate Council.
Ganduje had in a recent TV interview said that he would soon appoint a chairman for the State Council of Emirs.
During the interview, Ganduje, pointed out that the law empowers him to appoint, who becomes the chairman of the State Council of Emirs.
In a statement by Abba Anwar, his Chief Press Secretary, Ganduje restated that the reason behind the creation of four additional emirates headed by first-class emirs, was that they were in existence in the past.
He added that it was the people, who yearned for it, so as to facilitate and fast track the socio-economic development of their respective communities.
”There was a similar demand, during the reign of the late former governor of the old Kano State, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar Rimi, recalling that, at that time, the process for the creation of the then new emirates did not comply, with the provisions of the Constitution.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja
The Presidency has said that millions of Nigerians are not bothered about the rearrest of SaharaReporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore, at the Federal High Court in Abuja last Friday.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said this during Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme on Monday.
Adesina was asked to react to the outrage that greeted the violent rearrest of Sowore.
He said the Presidency stands by the claim of the State Security Service that the video circulating did not reflect what actually transpired in court.
The President’s spokesman added, “I don’t particularly agree with you when you say a lot of Nigerians (are not happy), you know that all this noise has been coming from less than 100,000 Nigerians. And the noise will be so loud that you think it is the whole country.
“It is a country of 198 million people. When just 100,000 are making noise in the social and traditional media, you would think the whole country is in an uproar. There are millions and millions of people who are not bothered.
“There are millions of people who know what the issues are. So, you cannot just seek the opinion of a local minority and then conclude that the country is in an uproar.”

The Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism has postponed the presentation of the award to Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo.
According to a statement signed by Motunrayo Alaka, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre, the decision was reached following the rearrest of Omoleye Sowore, Publisher of SaharaReporters, on Friday, by operatives of the Department of State Services.
Alaka said, “The postponement was decided on, to align with protests against the repression of freedom of speech in recent times especially the incident between the Department of State Security (DSS) and Omoleye Sowore, Publisher of Sahara Reporters, on Friday 6 December. The Vice President himself shares this awareness and the inappropriateness of the award at this point.”
The WSCIJ holds the award presentation event on December 9, the World Anti-Corruption Day and eve of the World Human Rights Day to highlight the importance of investigative reporting as a tool for accountability, good governance and social justice in a democracy.
WSCIJ had earlier announced that it would present an ‘Integrity speciality of the anti-corruption defender award’ to the vice-president for his “invaluable work of overhauling the Lagos State Judiciary, facilitating far-reaching reforms in the administration of justice in the state, his work of promoting integrity in the civil society and business in Nigeria and his consistency as a strong voice for promoting integrity in the country.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">1 / 3The candidate for the next Prime Minister of Finland, Sanna Marin, smiles after she won the SDP's Prime Minister candidate vote against Antti Lindtman, in Helsinki, Finland, Sunday, Dec. 8, 2019. A 34-year-old minister and lawmaker has been tapped to become Finland's youngest prime minister ever and its third female government head, replacing former Cabinet leader who resigned Tuesday. (Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva via AP)
COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Finland's next government is breaking the mold in multiple ways.
Sanna Marin, the 34-year-old transport minister, was tapped over the weekend by the ruling Social Democratic Party to be Finland's new prime minister. When she takes the reins of the country, most likely on Tuesday, she will become the world’s youngest sitting head of government.
In another unusual development, Marin will head a coalition with four other parties that are all led by women — three of whom are in their early 30s. Her own biography also breaks the mold: Raised by a single mother, she has described feeling discriminated against in Finland when her mother was in a relationship with another woman.
Elina Penttinen, a lecturer in gender studies at the University of Helsinski, said the rise of so many women is “exceptional” not only by the standards of the wider world, where older men hold most power, but even by the standards of Finland, which regularly ranks as one of the best countries in the world for gender equality.
“Here it seems pretty amazing, too,” she said.
The Social Democrats emerged as the strongest party after Finland's election in April. Antti Rinne, the incumbent prime minister whom Marin is replacing, stepped down last week amid political turmoil caused by a strike of postal workers. Rinne says he plans to continue as the Social Democrats' leader until a party congress next summer.
Penttinen described Marin as a talented politician known for her leadership skills whose progressive program stresses combating climate change, protecting the country's famous social protections like health care and reaching out to young people.
Finland, like much of the West, has seen a rise in right-wing populists and the nationalist Finns Party did well in April election, though centrist and left-wing parties won most votes and together could govern in the multi-party coalition.
“I hope it’s a sign of more change to come against populists, especially in the age of Trump and populism," Penttinen said.
A tweet by a journalist for Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat with photos of the quintet drew attention online by visually underscoring the idea of rising female power in politics.
Marin will become the youngest-serving leader of a government in the world, beating out Ukraine's 35-year-old prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk. She might not hold that title for long, however. Sebastian Kurz, the 33-year-old former Austrian chancellor who rose to that position when he was 31, won an election in September and is in talks to form a new governing coalition that would put him back in the job.
Marin joins a small group of female leaders who have sought to counteract the rise of populism. That group includes Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova, 46, a progressive whose election this year bucked the trend of populism and nationalism in Central Europe.
And like New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern — who is 39 — Marin is a new mother, having given birth to a daughter last year.
A lawmaker since 2015, Marin is the party's vice chairwoman and was minister for transport and communications in the outgoing government.
Lawmakers are likely to approve the new government this week so Marin can represent Finland at a summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Finland holds the EU's rotating presidency until the end of the year.
Beside Marin, the coalition's other party leaders are 32-year-old Katri Kulmuni of the Center Party; the Left Alliance's Li Andersson, 32; Maria Ohisalo, the 34-year-old leader of the Greens; and the head of the Swedish People’s Party, Anna-Maja Henriksson, who at 55 is the oldest.
The coalition will have a comfortable majority of 117 seats in the 200-seat Eduskunta, or Parliament.
The Center Party announced Monday that Kulmuni will be the finance minister in the new government.
Marin will be Finland's third female government leader. Women have been present in politics in the Nordic region for decades and today represent half of the party leaders in Sweden. Four of Denmark's nine parties are headed by women.
Mette Frederiksen became Denmark's prime minister in June, while Erna Solberg has been Norway's head of government since 2013.
Iceland's Vigdis Finnbogadottir was the first woman to be democratically elected as head of state by voters when she defeated three men for the presidency in 1980.
___
This story has been corrected to show that Marin is not party leader for the Social Democrats.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran is ready for more prisoner swaps with the United States, the Cabinet spokesman said Monday even as he reiterated the Iranian leadership's stance that there will be no other negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
The remarks by the spokesman, Ali Rabiei, were the first after a prisoner exchange over the weekend saw Iran free a Chinese-American scholar from Princeton who had been held for three years on widely criticized espionage charges.
The scholar, graduate student Xiyue Wang, was freed in exchange for Iranian scientist Massoud Soleimani who had faced a federal trial in Georgia over charges he violated sanctions by trying to have biological material brought to Iran.
“We are ready to cooperate to return all Iranians unlawfully imprisoned in the U.S.,” Rabiei told reporters at a briefing in Tehran. He said however that there will be no other negotiations with the U.S. beside this issue.
Rabiei said any further negotiations would be possible through the so-called 5+1 framework — a reference to the five permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany — under the condition that the U.S. first lift sanctions on Iran.
“The ball is in the US’ court,” said Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in a tweet later Monday. He said Iran was “fully ready for comprehensive prisoner exchange,” while attending a regional conference in Istanbul, Turkey.
Saturday's exchange was negotiated indirectly and took place in Switzerland, which looks after U.S. interests in Iran as Tehran and Washington have no diplomatic ties. The swap raised hopes of other similar actions and was seen as a rare diplomatic breakthrough between Tehran and Washington after months of tensions. But it was unclear if it would have any effect on Iranian-U.S. relations.
Crushing U.S. sanctions on Iran blocking it from selling crude oil abroad remain in place, part of President Donald Trump's maximum pressure campaign imposed following his unilateral withdraw from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year. Those sanctions in part fueled the anger seen in nationwide protests last month that Iranian security forces violently put down.
Amnesty International says that over 200 people were killed in the crackdown though Iran has offered no death toll or any other figures related to the unrest.
In a speech in parliament Monday, pro-reform Iranian lawmaker Parvaneh Salahshouri said the authorities should not have used force to serve their own interests, referring to the November protests.
“We have to find opportunities before it's too late. How can I tolerate the killing of young people as a member of parliament, and then seek re-election to represent the people?” she said. She also alleged authorities were out of touch with a changing Iranian society.
Iran’s currency, the rial, lost some 5% of its value against U.S. dollar Monday. In the Iranian capital, money exchange shops offered 135,000 rials for one U.S. dollar, having traded Sunday at about 128,000 to the dollar.
There remain other Western detainees from the U.S. and elsewhere who are held in Iran and who could be used as bargaining chips for future negotiations.
They include U.S. Navy veteran Michael White, who is serving a 10-year espionage sentence, as well as environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, an Iranian with U.S. and British citizenship also initially sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Also in Iran are 83-year-old Baquer Namazi and his son, Siamak Namazi, dual Iranian-American nationals facing 10-year sentences after they were convicted of collaborating with a hostile power. Baquer Namazi now is on a prison furlough. However, the Namazis say he remains unable to leave Iran.
Former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran in 2007 while on an unauthorized CIA mission, remains missing as well. Iran says that Levinson is not in the country and that it has no further information about him, but his family holds Tehran responsible for his disappearance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BofA Director Charged in Hong Kong After Scuffle With Police</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) -- A Bank of America Corp. anti-bribery and compliance director in Hong Kong was charged with assaulting a police officer after an altercation in a metro station over the weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The director, a 35-year-old American, was released on HK$10,000 ($1,300) bail and faces another hearing on Feb. 4, Oriental Daily and other media reported. Bank of America spokesman Mark Tsang declined to comment. Hong Kong police confirmed they had arrested a 35-year-old foreigner for obstructing and assaulting an officer seeking to stop a turnstile jumper.
The BofA employee is the latest Hong Kong banking professional to become entangled in the turmoil that has roiled the financial hub over the past six months. A Citigroup Inc. banker was detained last month after a scuffle with police, while BNP Paribas SA in September issued a public apology over pro-protest social media posts by one of its employees.
The turbulence has made office life tense in Hong Kong with firms across the city urging workers to prioritize their safety. The violence of the protests has subsided recently. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of marchers walked through central Hong Kong, in a largely peaceful gathering calling for greater freedom and democracy.
At a press conference on Monday, police said they made 42 protest-related arrests during the weekend, bringing the total to more than 6,000 since June. Police have fired 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 bean bag rounds and 1,850 sponge grenades over the past six months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ramaphosa Pledges Tough Love for Ailing South African Firms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Next Africa newsletter and follow Bloomberg Africa on Twitter
President Cyril Ramaphosa said he’s ready to make tough decisions about the future of South Africa’s struggling state-owned companies, after placing the national airline into bankruptcy protection last week.
“Business rescue is not the preferred option for fixing our state-owned enterprises, nor would it be necessarily advisable in other circumstances,” Ramaphosa wrote in his weekly open letter to the country. “But the resolve we have shown in putting South African Airways into business rescue cuts across all key state-owned enterprises. We are taking all necessary measures to turn them around.”
The main task facing the government is to reduce the financial dependence the companies have on the state, and as a result, any further financial support will come with “strict conditions” designed to promote sustainability and self-sufficiency, Ramaphosa said.
“We are clear that the state will retain ownership of all those state-owned entities that are strategic,” the president said. Where necessary, South Africa will seek strategic equity partners to help raise capital, source skills and technology, and improve efficiency, he said.
SAA has posted losses since 2012 as it grappled with the high operating costs of an aging, inefficient jet fleet and a bloated workforce, on top of high taxes, political interference and corruption scandals. State-owned power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. has to rely on state bailouts to continue operating, while the government-controlled national broadcaster is also among firms battling to survive.
“Despite the depth of the current challenges, none of our state-owned entities is lost,” Ramaphosa said. “They can all be saved. But it will take extraordinary effort and, in some cases, tough decisions.”
Besides SAA, the government has taken a hard line on addressing financial and operational problems at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, with Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula announcing Monday that it had been placed under administration. The agency, which transports about 2.3 million commuters daily, has wracked up billions of rands in irregular expenditure, obtained qualified audit reports and had years of management upheaval.
“The urgency of addressing Prasa’s turn-around cannot be overemphasized, and tangible results that people can see must be realized in the shortest possible time,” Mbalula said in an emailed statement. Bongisizwe Mpondo, an entrepreneur with extensive experience in helping turn around public institutions, will run the agency for the next 12 months, whereupon a new permanent board will be appointed, he said.
(Updates with rail agency placed into administration in last two paragraphs.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Toxic’ Mueller Impeachment Article Threatens to Split Dems</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that House Democrats would proceed with articles of impeachment, she did so in the language of duty, history, and the Constitution. “This has nothing to do with politics,” she said. “It’s about the Constitution of the United States.”
In almost the same breath, Pelosi revealed that it does, in fact, have at least something to do with politics. Asked what her “a-ha” moment was—the thing that got the long-reluctant speaker on board with impeachment—she said the Ukraine allegations against President Trump “changed everything.”
“The polls,” said Pelosi, “went from 59 percent opposed to impeachment, to 34 in favor, to now even.”
That conspicuous juxtaposition of lofty principle and hard political reality highlights the tension at the heart of the impeachment process as it heads into a decisive stretch. This week, Democrats’ sense of obligation and their sense of politics will be on a collision course as lawmakers debate, draft, and introduce their articles of impeachment against Trump, which are set to be revealed within days.
That’s because the decision of what, exactly, to impeach Trump over will challenge the near-unanimity that’s existed within this big, fractious group of Democrats. Their overwhelming consensus so far has been that the president’s desire to pressure Ukraine into doing him personal political favors merited the use of the House’s most powerful check against a president for just the fourth time in the country’s history. 
No such consensus existed for other elements of Trump’s conduct in office, particularly the allegations of obstruction of justice outlined in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The majority of the public, as Pelosi noted, did not feel those charges justified impeachment—and neither did she. Even though over half of the Democratic caucus was publicly supportive of impeachment before the Ukraine story emerged, the moderate and purple-district lawmakers who won them the majority dismissed a Mueller-based impeachment drive as political suicide. 
Now, Democratic leadership and lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee—the panel that led House Democrats’ charge on all things Mueller—are weighing whether to weave that thread into articles of impeachment. Few on Capitol Hill predict this will be a fight that tears the party apart, but strong views on the subject abide, and lawmakers on both ends of the debate are anxiously bracing for a decision that amounts to something like a final judgment from House Democrats on the president’s conduct. 
“From the very beginning, we were clear that the process should be clear, strategic, and efficient,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman Democrat from a Trump-won district in Michigan. In a September op-ed written with several like-minded colleagues, Slotkin called for an impeachment inquiry based squarely on the anonymous whistleblower’s complaint. The move went down as the speaker’s come-to-Jesus moment on impeachment; she launched the inquiry the next day. 
“Clear, meaning we have to make the case to the American people. We got that strategic focus on specific articles, hone in on those—don't take a kitchen-sink approach, really think strategically. And then efficient. This doesn't need to be an 18-month process,” Slotkin told The Daily Beast on Thursday. “I have made myself clear that it should be a very tight group of articles, very limited, very focused.”
This view is not exactly shared by many of Slotkin’s colleagues. “You might say I’m in the kitchen sink caucus,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, a northern California Democrat who has long backed impeachment. 
“This office has been abused and damaged in profound ways,” Huffman said on Friday. “I personally would be for holding him accountable for every bit of it. Not for every grievance we have—I wouldn't include his bad behavior or his offensive rhetoric—but some specific actions that I believe that have abused authority and rise to the level of impeachable offense, in my view, would go well beyond the current Ukraine scandal.”
But many Democrats in this boat admit the moment is simply too important for the party to suffer any real show of discord. Huffman says he would “accept a more strategically focused set of articles if that's the decision,” but said he expected some kind of compromise to emerge. 
Over the weekend, the Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) held closed-door discussions about the possible scope of articles of impeachment and prepared members of the panel for the significant week to come. On Monday, the committee will convene for a hearing where lawmakers will hear prepared evidence for impeachment. 
According to a source familiar with the committee’s plans, Democrats spent the weekend huddling with Harvard constitutional law professor Lawrence Tribe and holding mock hearings—during which Democrats played the roles of GOP members like top Judiciary Republican Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), who has made parliamentary and process based interruptions central to the party’s hearing strategy. 
The format of the hearing is a sign that Mueller’s Russia investigation could get another high-profile public airing. On Monday, attorneys for both Judiciary and the House Intelligence Committees will present evidence that Trump committed impeachable offenses. Intelligence submitted a lengthy report on the Ukraine matter, but Judiciary has spent all year focused on Mueller. 
On Sunday, Nadler appeared on CNN and said that he is seriously considering an article of impeachment based on the Mueller findings in order to establish a “pattern” of wrongdoing by Trump that goes beyond Ukraine and encompasses his entire presidency.  
Democrats both on Nadler’s panel and around the caucus see the logic to that move. “If there is an obstruction article, how do you ignore documented evidence of obstruction by the special counsel, for which he essentially said, ‘I’m not charging because of the Justice Department policy regarding the charging of a president,’ the Congress has remedies available,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) on Friday. “To me, that's just like, a great big blinking light that says, yeah, you really need to look at that.”
An idea percolating within the caucus is that the Mueller-related charges could be put to the floor precisely so that moderates could vote against them, while the Ukraine-focused articles would stand a far stronger chance of passing. “Including one or two counts of obstruction for the Mueller report is totally appropriate,” said Huffman. “And if our more politically fragile members feel like they've got to vote against that, let them do it.”
But among those who represent competitive districts, taking such a vote may not be such an appealing prospect. One aide associated with the moderate wing of the party said any vote on Mueller-focused impeachment grounds puts these lawmakers in a “terrible position.”
“Largely, there’s no support of idea of bringing up articles about Mueller,” said the aide, calling the investigation’s entire subject matter politically “toxic” in the districts these lawmakers represent. This wing of the party is anxiously watching to see how Nadler—likely with a heavy hand from the speaker—draws up the articles. “Thirty-one Democratic members of Congress in Trump districts are going to be living with the decisions he makes for the next year,” said the aide.
There’s some hope, however, that this could result in some kind of compromise to be brokered this week that reconciles the tension baked into Democrats’ impeachment enterprise. “I mean, we're not gonna send everybody home happy,” said Huffman. “That's just inherent in the situation that has been forced upon us.”
Among some of the lawmakers who decided to support impeachment knowing it could be a liability back home, there’s a sense that the most important Rubicon has already been crossed.
“For many of us, if this was purely a political issue, we would not have come out in support of an inquiry,” said Slotkin, who is just one of several Democrats already seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of impeachment-based attack ads against them in their districts. 
“So you have this threshold where you say, doesn't matter what a poll says, it doesn't matter what my consultants are telling me to do, what matters is right and wrong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elizabeth Warren Built the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It Became a Revolving Door.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) began staffing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 and 2011, she did something that appeared, at first blush, to be highly counterintuitive. 
Instead of limiting staff to those with extensive background in consumer activism and regulatory policy, she chose people with places like Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Capital One on their CVs.
Those financial institutions were the very entities that the CFPB was supposed to haunt. The agency had been included in financial regulatory reform as a wishlist item for Wall Street-skeptical progressives. And yet, here was Warren—the intellectual godmother of the CFPB—handing out key roster assignments to officials from those very institutions. 
Before long, the supply chain was working the other way. As the CFPB carried out its mission during the Obama years, undertaking reforms to practices from aggressive debt collection to payday lending to mortgage finance rules, some of its senior staffers would leave the agency to work in the financial sector, many of them helping major banking and securities firms understand and navigate the rules they’d just helped write. As the agency pursued billions in civil penalties against financial firms, some of its senior officials found themselves on the payrolls of the sort of companies the CFPB was created to scrutinize and hold accountable.
It’s the sort of “revolving door” between government industry that Warren has decried as a progressive stalwart in the Senate and a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. And it could complicate her efforts to make the CFPB a cornerstone of her White House bid by drawing cries of hypocrisy from campaign rivals. 
But beyond the talking points, the hirings also offer an unexpected window into Warren’s approach to governance, suggesting that she’s a shrewder, more pragmatic policymaker than her persona as a populist firebrand indicates.
In the Warren vs. Dimon Feud, It’s Warren, Not Even Close
The CFPB was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, which resulted in mass mortgage defaults and hammered American debtors. Warren, then a Harvard professor, had dreamt up the idea and became the Obama administration's point person in devising a new agency to serve as a consumer finance watchdog and ensure that borrowers were not being fleeced by the financial institutions on which their livelihoods depended. Warren never actually led the agency, which was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. There were internal White House fears that her presence atop the CFPB would spark immense backlash among Senate Republicans, so she was made a “senior adviser” with heavy sway over its inception and—most critically—early staffing decisions. 
“She was monstrously productive from a recruiting point of view,” recalled Raj Date, who served as CFPB’s associate director of research, markets, and regulation. “I grew up around successful recruiting engines—at McKinsey, at Capital One—and I have never seen a human being better at recruiting than her.”
Warren’s central role was evident in a report that the CFPB released in 2011 recapping its creation and launch and the early progress it had made as the nation’s first federal consumer finance watchdog. She wrote a letter of introduction for the report, hailing the “strong foundation” for the agency and pledging, “in the years ahead, the CFPB will work hard for consumers across the country.”
The report identified 21 people in senior CFPB leadership positions that had been instrumental in getting the new agency off the ground. They included some notable names from the financial sector. Date had been a managing director at Deutsche Bank in addition to his prior roles at McKinsey and Capital One. Elizabeth Vale, who oversaw community banks and credit unions at the agency, had been a managing director at Morgan Stanley. CFPB’s chief operating officer, Catherine West, had led Capital One’s credit card division.
Take a Bow, Elizabeth Warren
While Warren plucked talent from the financial services industries, the relationship became even more intertwined over the subsequent years. Nearly half of the senior officials—nine out of the 21—mentioned in that report would go on to work in financial services, or for law or consulting firms with expertise and clientele in the sector, after their tenure at the CFPB.
Roberto Gonzalez, for instance, served as the agency's deputy general counsel before becoming a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP. He “represents financial institutions and other companies in high-stakes litigation, investigations and advisory matters,” according to the law firm’s website, which boasts that he helped “a major U.S. bank in connection with a favorable settlement with the CFPB.”
“Roberto is an extraordinary lawyer with deep knowledge of the broad range of complex issues facing financial institutions, including, specifically, in the areas of financial regulation, DoddFrank, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and cybersecurity,” the firm’s chairman told Law360 in 2016. “Needless to say, Roberto’s expertise is in high demand today.”
It’s precisely that sort of demand that fuels Washington’s revolving door, and has created a cottage industry of former regulators who cash out to the industries they once regulated. Such moves can create perverse incentives for government employment: Those who go into public service in the hope of landing a lucrative private sector career afterward may be just as willing to side with industry in the hope of future pay as former industry lobbyists and executives who move into government positions.
“In many ways, I find revolving out into industry more problematic than coming from industry,” said Jeff Hauser, the executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, in an interview. “That influences your incentives in office, if you think you’re going to go work in this industry... There’s a willingness to rock the boat that I think is diminished if you want to enter the field that you’d be shaking up.”
Hauser noted, though, that Warren has proposed policies that would have blocked at least some of the career moves that CFPB staffers took into private industries if they had been in effect at the time. That’s something the Warren campaign stressed as well.
“Elizabeth is the leader—Republican or Democrat—in proposing a set of serious anti-corruption reforms and it will be her top priority to make them law,” campaign spokeswoman Saloni Sharma said in an emailed statement. “Her legislation will expand the definition of lobbyists to include anyone paid to influence lawmakers and ban giant companies, banks, and monopolies from hiring former senior government officials for at least four years.” 
Warren has also committed to imposing those standards on her administration if she’s elected president, even barring any action on the proposed legislation by Congress.
Warren’s campaign did not address more specific questions about the revolving door between the early CFPB and the companies it regulated. Those questions go to the heart of the dilemma facing policymakers as they look to effectively wield the nation’s regulatory agencies while preventing and rooting out corruption: namely, how to staff the federal administrative apparatus with people who know the issues in their portfolio but are driven by public, not private, interests.
As a presidential candidate, Warren has come down firmly on the anti-corruption side of that dilemma—blocking or at least slowing the revolving door. But that approach can come at the expense of expertise that former industry insiders can offer. It can also preclude the private sector companies from hiring the very regulators who can help them make sense of often complex regulatory regimes and even imbue their industry with a sense of mission. 
It’s the latter approach that Warren appears to have embraced in the early days of the CFPB. She often stressed that the agency was drawing talent and expertise from a host of backgrounds, including industry, in an effort to craft a more effective regulatory apparatus.
It’s an approach that Date described as a break from traditional progressive thinking on financial watchdog efforts, which often elevate consumer advocates and lawyers. 
“If you want to build and operate these agencies well, it cannot just be a bunch of lawyers,” he said. “This notion that a critical qualification to make policy for an industry is to have never been in it—the idea that you are more capable the less you know—I find that notion, on its face, absurd.”
The other side of the CFPB revolving door had its benefits, too, Date said. The dispersal of people from the agency, who were instrumental in its creation and committed to its mission, into the financial services industry had an evangelizing effect, he said.
"There are lots of reasons where I thought the most important thing longer-term was to take people, a nontrivial number of people, who live what it’s like to be the enforcers and articulators of what the right principles should be, it would be good if you take people who internalized what these principled-based views should be and take that into industry,” Date said. “That’s good. We have suffered from that in consumer finance."

Paris (AFP) - France's transport chaos deepened Monday on the fifth day of a nationwide strike over pension reforms, ramping up tensions at the start of a crucial week in President Emmanuel Macron's battle with trade unions.
With only two of the Paris metro's 16 lines running as normal and suburban trains also heavily disrupted, many commuters slipped behind the wheel to try to get to work in torrential rain, causing major gridlock.
By 9 am, the tailbacks in the Paris area ran to 600 kilometres (370 miles), twice the normal level, the Sytadin monitoring website said.
Large queues formed at bus stops following an announcement that one out of two buses would be running but striking workers blocked seven out of 25 bus depots, leaving more travellers stranded.
With many having opted to work from home last week and only now returning to the workplace, this week will test public support for the strike.
A poll Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper showed 53 percent of the French supporting the strike or expressing sympathy for their demands, up six points in a week.
Unions have called a second day of mass protests for Tuesday, a day before the government unveils the full details of its plans for a single points-based pension scheme that does away with dozens of more advantageous plans enjoyed by train drivers, sailors, lawyers and other professions.
- 'A monstrosity' -
Critics argue that the shake-up will require people in both the public and private sector to work longer for a smaller retirement payout.
Teachers are expected to walk out again for the second time in a week Tuesday, leading to widespread school closures.
Firefighters, electricity workers and "yellow vest" anti-government demonstrators have also joined railway workers in the streets in recent days.
The government's pensions envoy Jean-Paul Delevoye, who drafted the reforms, and Health Minister Agnes Buzyn will meet with trade unions on Monday to try to negotiate an end to the deadlock.
But the unions have sounded an uncompromising note.
"I will not negotiate over the implementation of what I describe as a monstrosity which endangers tomorrow's pensioners," said Yves Veyrier, the head of the militant Force Ouvriere union.
The strike has squeezed retailers in the run-up to Christmas, raising the prospect of another bleak year-end after the unrest caused by the yellow vests in late 2018.
The first day of the stoppage already caused an average 30 percent drop in sales, according to the Alliance of Commerce, which represents 27,000 supermarkets and clothing and shoe stores with almost 200,000 workers.
A hotel association said reservations in the larger Paris region dropped by 30 to 40 percent on the first day of the strike.
Regional and international trains, including the Eurostar to London and Thalys to Brussels, have also been hobbled by the unrest, and several flights were cancelled on the first days of the strike.
- Fairer system for all? -
Over 800,000 people took to the streets when the strike was launched on December 5, many accusing Macron of trying to weaken France's generous social safety net.
The president, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and senior cabinet ministers met late Sunday to discuss the changes, which they argue will ensure a fairer and more sustainable system for all.
"If we do not carry out a far-reaching, serious and progressive reform today, someone else will do a really brutal one tomorrow," Philippe told Le Journal du Dimanche.
The strike has drawn comparisons with late 1995 when three weeks of strikes forced the then centre-right government to withdraw its pension reforms.
Adrien Quatennens, a lawmaker from the far-left France Unbowed party, acknowledged on LCI radio that the strike was hard on businesses and commuters, but said: "It's better to endure a few weeks of hassle than... years of hardship" in retirement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The GOP wall: Why Republicans won't walk away from Trump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — Late in the afternoon of Aug. 7, 1974, Republican leaders in Congress traveled up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House to deliver a stark message to Richard Nixon: His presidency was over.
The public had turned on Nixon as evidence emerged about his role in the Watergate scandal and the bottom fell out once his own party abandoned him.
"None of us doubted the outcome. He would resign," conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater later wrote of the meeting in his memoir. Two days later, Nixon stepped down.
Today, as Democrats in the House of Representatives move toward bringing articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, with the next Judiciary Committee hearing of evidence set for Monday, few Democrats are still clinging to the hope that Republicans will reach a breaking point with Trump like they did with Nixon.
"I really don't think there is any fact that would change their minds," Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told NBC News.
Why? Two key changes since Nixon: a massive divide in American political life — we hate the other team more than ever before — and a media climate that fuels and reinforces that chasm, powered by Fox News on the Republican side.
Himes said he was "a little stunned by the unanimity on the Republican side," especially among retiring lawmakers who don't have to worry about surviving a GOP primary had they gone against Trump. "We're in a place right now where all that matters to my Republican colleagues is the defense of the president," he added.
No Republican congressmen have said they support impeachment. In the Senate, the entire GOP voted to condemn the impeachment inquiry, except for three moderates: Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The three have stopped short of saying they support Trump's impeachment, however, and it would take at least 20 Republican senators to vote to convict him in a Senate trial for removal to succeed.
Meanwhile, pollsshow Americans' views on Trump and impeachment have barely budged, even though millions tuned in to watch the televised hearings before the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees over the last few weeks.
The sliver of the electorate that remains undecided seems to be mainly those paying the least attention to politics, so it's unclear whether new information would really even sway them.
"The numbers still don't look good for Trump, but they definitely haven't gotten worse," pollster Tim Malloy of Quinnipiac University said.
That's not how it happened 45 years ago, when televised Watergate hearings helped turn the tide of public opinion against a president who had just been re-elected in a landslide. The public pressure helped push a number of Republicans to abandon Nixon and join a bipartisan impeachment drive.
William Cohen, a former GOP House member, senator and Secretary of Defense from Maine, doesn't think that will happen today.
He was one of seven Republicans out of 17 on the House Judiciary Committee who voted to advance articles of impeachment against Nixon and was one of the most vocal critics of Watergate at the time.
"We're living in a really different era," he said. "The partisanship is deeper. It's a cynical, suspicious society. The conspiracy theories that were once fringe elements have been allowed to filter into the mainstream."
Until relatively recently, the political parties were jumbled coalitions of regional, ideological and racial groups that included conservative Democrats in the South and liberal Republicans from the Northeast.
The first Republican senator to call for Nixon's resignation, for instance, was an African American from Massachusetts, Edward Brooke.
And Nixon found staunch support among some Democrats, too, many of whom represented working-class areas that had been part of the "silent majority" that helped the president win 49 out of 50 states in his 1972 re-election. As late as July of 1974, just days before Republicans leaders went to the White House to tell Nixon to quit, The Washington Post estimated there were still about 25 House Democrats in the "never" camp on impeachment.
Both support for and opposition to impeachment were bipartisan.
Since then, the Democratic and Republican parties have slowly congealed into monoliths of like-minded Americans who not only vote the same way, but also tend to live in the same kinds of neighborhoods, listen to the same kinds of music, worship (or not) the same way — even wear the same kinds of jeans.
Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it's not just polarization, but "tribalism."
"That means anyone who is not part of your tribe is the enemy," Ornstein said. "And anything you do to take on your own tribe becomes heresy. And I think that's different from what we had before."
Political scientists call it "negative partisanship" because Americans are now often driven more by wanting to punish the other side than wanting to advance their own cause.
Republicans know well by now that anyone who steps out of line in Trump's GOP faces near certain excommunication and humiliation, with a long trail of upended careers as proof in the likes of Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Mark Sanford. No one is safe, not even Sen. John McCain, a war hero.
"I've never seen anything like it," Cohen said. "The Republican Party today is not loyal to principles as such, but loyal to the person of Donald Trump. He is really a cult figure. Nixon was not a cult figure. With Nixon, you didn't feel the personal loyalty to the man, but to the party."
As the political landscape cleaved in the past 40 years, so did the way voters get information about politics and the trust they put in it.
Americans had little choice but to learn about Watergate through the mainstream media. There were only three major TV networks, so they couldn't switch away to a cable or streaming show when their program got interrupted by special reports on the Watergate hearings.
The result was more than 70 percent of the country tuned in to at least part of the Watergate hearings. And they generally believed the news.
The vast majority of Americans — 69 percent — said in 1974 that they trusted the media to report the news "fully, accurately and fairly," according to Gallup. That number has plummeted to just 41 percent today.
The collapse is driven largely by Republicans. Today, just 15 percent of Republicans say they generally trust the mainstream media, compared with 69 percent of Democrats.
There's only one news outlet that a majority of Republicans told Gallup they trust today: Fox News.
Of course, key voices on Fox and other conservative media outlets have consistently defended Trump, attacked Democrats, sown doubt about the mainstream press, and advanced alternative theories, often lacking basis and of a conspiratorial nature, to explain away any damaging facts about Trump that have emerged from the inquiry.
John Dean, the former Nixon White House lawyer who helped turn the tide on Watergate by testifying against the president, has famously said that Nixon "might have survived if there'd been a Fox News."
"Polarization cannot be a justification for Republican facts, morality and rule of law or a Democratic facts, morality and rule of law," Dean added in an email to NBC News. "If polarization justifies multiple realities, democracy as we know it has ended."
But Nixon biographer John Farrell noted the mainstream press had a more positive view of Nixon that the famed story of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's hard-nosed reporting often obscures.
"Nixon's support in the 1972 election was widespread in the press," Farrell said. "He was probably endorsed by 90 percent of the nation's newspaper editorial boards. It took a very long time for the press to come around and it took an even longer time for the public to follow."
Today, conservative media has doubled down on support for Trump, reassuring its audience there's nothing to be concerned about, either in Trump's actions with Ukraine or Democrats' decision to draft articles of impeachment against him.
"The Democrats have just hoisted themselves on their own petard, guaranteeing Donald Trump re-election in 2020," Fox host Jeanine Pirro said in a clip Trump tweeted to her millions of followers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Macron positive after Zelenskiy's first face-to-face with Putin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for the first time since taking office, at a summit in Paris on Monday to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine.
Convened by French President Emmanuel Macron and also attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the summit is the first real test for the Ukrainian leader who ran for office on a pledge to end the protracted conflict in his country.
Adding to the pressure for the comedian-turned-politician is the fact that thousands rallied on Sunday in Kyiv calling on him not to "capitulate" and grant Putin too many concessions.
More than 13,000 people have died in the five-year conflict opposing Ukrainian security forces and Russian-backed separatists, including some 3,300 civilians, according to the UN.
A ceasefire was agreed to in the Minsk Protocol signed in 2014 but has been violated with outbreaks of fighting regularly recorded near Donetsk and Luhansk.
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Macron hailed the very fact the summit was held as an achievement.
"The fact that we are side by side today in Paris is in itself an important outcome in many ways, a credible resuming that is in no way obtained in advance considering the absence of a concrete progress for several years," he said.
Angela Merkel meanwhile said while there is a lot of work to do, there is "goodwill to resolve difficult questions", adding she was very pleased with the meeting.
Zelenskiy argued in a Facebook video released last week that the meeting "is already a victory for Ukraine".
He then defended the decision to meet with Putin despite the Russian leader refusing to put the annexed peninsula of Crimea on the negotiating table by telling Ukrainian television that Russia's release of Ukrainian sailors and vessels is "a signal that Russia is ready to talk".
But expectations of a breakthrough are fairly low.
Analysts say that Zelenskiy in particular needs to return home with "something tangible."
"A cease-fire and a prisoner swap should be well within reach. No party will want to walk home empty-handed, and at least officially, both Ukraine and Russia are interested in a cessation of hostilities and the return of prisoners," Cyrus Newlin and Jeffrey Mankoff from the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank, wrote in a note last week.
Beyond Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, one of the main areas of contention is the province of Donbas — where Donetsk and Luhansk are located — and its status.
Zelenskiy has stressed that elections would only be held in the separatist-held province once Moscow had relinquished control of the border and withdrawn its troops.
But Russia is unlikely to do so, having advocated for the region to be granted a special status which would see it continue to exert influence in Ukrainian politics.
Zelenskiy has called on both Paris and Berlin to support his position on the different issues but the latest summit comes amidst a push by Macron to reopen "a strategic dialogue" with Russia.
"If we want to build peace in Europe, to rebuild European strategic autonomy, we need to reconsider our position with Russia," he told the Economist magazine last month.
Zelenskiy, who used to play the Ukrainian leader in a popular television show before his election, might find a more receptive audience in Merkel.
Germany expelled two Russian diplomats last week over Moscow's suspected involvement in the murder of a Georgian activist in Berlin.

“The police estimate that there were 50 people on or around the island at the time of the eruption. We know that 23 people have been rescued from the island (so far), some of them had critical injuries, including serious burns. Many of those critically injured were flown to Auckland to a specialist burns unit.”
At least five people have died after a volcano erupted in New Zealand. Police say around 50 visitors were near the popular tourist site of White Island when the active volcano began erupting on Monday at 2 p.m. local time. Several people have been taken to hospital with critical injuries. The authorities are now planning to launch a search and rescue mission but say it is too dangerous to reach the area at the moment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">LTA awards S$210 million contract for Jurong West, Bahar Junction MRT stations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE: Two Jurong Region Line stations will be designed and constructed by the Singapore branch of China Railway 11 Bureau Group, the Land Transport Authority said on Monday (Dec 9).
The S$210.1 million contract for the Jurong West and Bahar Junction stations also includes 1.15km of viaducts.
Jurong West station will be located along Jurong West Avenue 2, adjacent to Jurong West Street 23. The station will have a single island platform serving trains for both the Choa Chu Kang-bound and Jurong Pier-bound directions.
Bahar Junction station will be located along Jurong West Avenue 4, near the junction of Jurong West Street 64 and Street 75. It will have two platforms connected by a 100-metre covered link bridge with travellators.
One platform will serve trains heading to Choa Chu Kang and Jurong Pier while the other platform will serve trains heading to Peng Kang Hill.
LTA said the Singapore branch of the China Railway 11 Bureau Group is an "established and experienced” construction company that has completed various rail-related projects worldwide.
The company has completed several major infrastructure projects in Singapore including three MRT stations - Tuas Link, Tuas West Road and Tuas Crescent stations - and their associated viaducts on the East-West Line’s Tuas West Extension.
“The company also constructed Singapore’s first integrated rail and road viaduct as part of the Tuas West Extension project,” LTA added.
The Jurong Region Line is Singapore’s seventh MRT line, which will open in three stages starting from 2026.
The 24km-long line will have 24 stations above ground, and will connect with the North-South Line and East-West Line with interchange stations at Boon Lay, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East MRT stations.
The Jurong Region Line is expected to serve 200,000 commuters daily in its initial phase of operation. This is expected to grow to more than 500,000 commuters daily in the longer term, according to LTA.​​​​​​​
Construction is expected to start in 2020 and be completed in 2026.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US confirms Washington visit by Russian foreign minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will welcome his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday (Dec 10) - the Russian's first visit to Washington since a controversial 2017 meeting with US President Donald Trump, the State Department announced.
The brief statement about the meeting, to be held at the State Department, said Pompeo and Lavrov would "discuss a broad range of regional and bilateral issues."
On Friday, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the meeting was being "prepared" for Tuesday.
The situations in war-wracked Syria and Ukraine are likely to top the agenda. The Washington meeting will come on the heels of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky over the conflict in Ukraine's east in Paris on Monday.
Iran and North Korea are also of mutual concern in Washington and Moscow.
Pompeo and Lavrov met in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.
But Lavrov has not been on an official visit to the US capital since his encounter with Trump in the Oval Office in May 2017, which was followed by allegations that the US leader divulged classified intelligence in the meeting.
Photographs of the meeting showed Lavrov, Trump and subsequently sacked Russian envoy to Washington Sergei Kislyak sharing a laugh.
US intelligence concluded that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election with an eye to swinging it in Trump's favor, but US special counsel Robert Mueller found there was not enough evidence to prove that Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian government in those efforts.
The report did not conclude that Trump had committed a crime, but it also did not fully exonerate him.
"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state," Mueller's long-awaited report said.
"Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Insurance, road tax for Zahid's 20 vehicles paid by Yayasan Akalbudi, court told</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — The High Court today was told that the road tax and insurance for 20 vehicles belonging to former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi amounting RM107,509.55 was paid using funds from Yayasan Akalbudi Foundation fund, between January and September 2015.
Allianz General Insurance agent, Ahmad Izhan Abd Rashid, 40, said the payment was received through three Affin Bank checks belonging to the foundation from Ahmad Zahid’s personal assistant, Major Mazlina Mazlan.
The 14th prosecution witness said the cheque dated January 22, 2015 was for RM24,980.55, another cheque for RM43,645 was dated April 15, 2015, while the third cheque was dated September 22, 2015, for RM38,884.
“The cheques were written in my name because after I deposited the cheques, I will withdraw some amount for payment of the road tax because the payment was made in cash to the Road Transport Department (JPJ).
“I would also withdraw a certain amount of money to be deposited in a current account belonging to Maya Consultant Services (which belongs to Ahmad Izhan) for the purpose of paying for the car insurance premiums,” he said when reading out his witness statement during examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Lee Keng Fatt.
Ahmad Izhan said this on the ninth day Ahmad Zahid’s trial on 47 charges — 12 for criminal breach of trust (CBT), eight for corruption and 27 for money laundering — involving tens of millions of ringgit in funds belonging to Akalbudi Foundation.
The witness, who has been an agent for the insurance company since 2006, said the former deputy prime minister took 39 car insurance policies from him and they were for 20 vehicles, including 18 luxury vehicles such as BMW X5, Mini Coopers S, BMW 320i (A), Mercedes Benz CLS350 and a BMW R1200 GS motorcycle.
Prior to this, 13th witness, Fang Suat Lim, who is the manager of the Allianz General Insurance branch at Wisma Allianz, Jalan Gereja, here, told the court that Ahmad Zahid took four types of insurance policies, namely ‘private car policy’, ‘motorcycle policy’ , ‘enhanced road warrior policy’ and ‘bike warrior policy’.
She said the nominees for the insurance were Ahmad Zahid, his wife, Datin Seri Hamidah Khamis, and their children, Nurulizwani, Datuk Nurulhidayah and Ahmad Syafiq Hazieq.
Meanwhile, Ahmad Izhan told the court that he would go to Ahmad Zahid’s house at Country Heights, Kajang to handover the insurance policies and road tax of the vehicles concerned.
When questioned by Ahmad Zahid’s lawyer, Hamidi Mohd Noh, Ahmad Izhan concurred with the counsel that the ink used to sign and write the particulars on the three cheques was not the same.
Ahmad Izhan said he also agreed with Hamidi that the cheques were presign cheques.
When re-examined by Lee, the witness said he knew the three checks were ‘presign cheques’ as Mazlina told him that she would get Ahmad Zahid to sign the blank cheques, and she would fill the necessary particulars, to speed up the matter.
The hearing before judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues tomorrow. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sabah govt views seriously re-emergence of polio, says Shafie</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KOTA KINABALU, Dec 9 — The Sabah government views seriously the re-emergence of polio in the state, the first for the country after almost 30 years, and will do its level best to ensure that it will not spread, Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal said.
He said the re-emergence of the disease is not something that should be taken lightly.
Hence, he said he had instructed the state’s Ministry of Health and People’s Wellbeing to take necessary action to address the situation.
“They will give me a complete report on this and, so far, I was made to understand that the case has been handled well to ensure that the disease will not spread.
“I hope that all parents will ensure that proper vaccines are given to their newborn children,” he told a press conference after attending the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Talk with Sabah State Government programme here today.
Yesterday, the Health Ministry announced that a three-month-old baby boy from Tuaran, Sabah was confirmed to have contracted polio, 27 years since the disease was eradicated from the country.
Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the baby had fever followed by weakness in the limbs and had been admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital before being diagnosed with vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) on Friday (December 6).
According to him, the infant was still being treated in an isolation ward and was in stable condition but still needed breathing aid. — Bernama

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A congregation of more than 100 attended the Rotary Tree of Light dedication service at St Mary’s Church, Shrewsbury.
Amongst those present were the Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire, Anna Turner; the High Sheriff Dr Josh Dixey and the Mayor Councillor Phil Gillam.
Rotarians from the three Shrewsbury Rotary clubs were joined by members of the public for the service conducted by Preb David Crowhurst, President of the Rotary Club of Church Stretton.
The Tree of Light was brought to Shrewsbury almost 30 years’ ago by former Rotarian Paul Firmin to benefit charities and good causes.
Since then the Rotary Tree of Light has raised more than £140,000 and this year’s beneficiaries will be The Samaritans, Parkinson’s and the Food Hub, all recognised as ‘deserving’ causes.
The Tree of Light presents an opportunity to make a donation of £5 or more in memory of a loved one and those wishing to donate can contact Rotarian Mike Haw on 01743 240356.
Taking part in the service were the choir Of One Accord.
The names of donors and those commemorated are displayed around the Tree and in the Shrewsbury Chronicle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reputation Cost</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What’s the value of a congressional reputation? You’d think it would be pretty low these days but that doesn’t mean that legislators don’t think highly of themselves.
I bring this up in light of the oddly specific damages request in a federal defamation complaint filed in Virginia on behalf of Congressman Devin Nunes against Cable News Network.
Nunes (or at least his lawyer) asked for $435 million plus an extra $350,000 in punitive damages. You don’t often see a punitive damages request that’s less than the compensatory one but I guess the congressman was trying not to be harsh.
There’s no explanation in the suit for the damages calculation and I have no idea whether the congressman has a good case here, but let’s try to imagine that he wins and then has to prove the value of his injury. There are some fascinating issues here.
The obvious one is whether anyone thinks differently about the congressman. You either love him or hate him — there’s not a lot in between. If you call someone a thief, we agree that’s bad. If you call a politician devious, you get an argument.
So maybe CNN’s damages should be limited by the percentage of the population that thought less of Nunes after it ran its story.
As for that $435 million figure — it definitely catches the eye in news headlines and stories.
We reporter types love shiny objects and that number is a gleaming gemstone. You don’t file a boring lawsuit if you want to be noticed.
The complaint, by the way, is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. You’d think it could have been produced by a public relations team or a campaign staff. Those of you looking to improve your public profiles should study this.
There’s a lovely chart, beautiful color photos and a lengthy adoring profile of the plaintiff.  The suit gets right to the headline point with that big number up front.
Then there’s this at the beginning of the introduction: “CNN is the mother of fake news. It is the least trusted name. CNN is eroding the fabric of America, proselytizing, sowing distrust and disharmony. It must be held accountable.”
Let that passage sink in for a moment.
Here are my questions: Who is the father of fake news and how did he meet CNN? (There’s got to be a rom-com in there somewhere.)
Should you be defaming the company that you’re suing for defamation? (I know that’s OK in a lawsuit, but certain politicians say this sort of thing all the time outside of lawsuits.) Shouldn’t CNN cross-complain or sue a bunch of politicians?
How does CNN’s reputation compare financially with a congressperson’s reputation? Think about all the lawsuits that The Failing New York Times could file.
Imagine the discovery process on the issue of fake news. This could be very educational for all of us.
The hunt. Where are the witches? We’ve had nonstop witch hunts for years now and not a single witch has been indicted. Why?
I think the answer is obvious: The witches are in control. There are signs everywhere. Can you look deeply into the eyes of Adam Schiff and Devin Nunes and not realize they’ve been bewitched?
Really. Pause your television and stare at their eyes. You’ll shudder.
And what else explains our alternate realities? Is Russia really Ukraine in disguise? Is Donald Trump a man of the people or the leader of the Nazi party? How can everyone look at the same things and see different worlds?
It’s witchcraft.
I realized this after reading about yet another politician claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. Most of us assumed they were talking about overzealous prosecutors and partisans — but what if those guys aren’t the real problem? What if famous people are being hunted by witches?
There are two discussions to be had here. One — of particular interest to lawyers — is the proper way to defend witchcraft victims. The other is how to find witches and stop them.
Let’s deal with the first topic. It’s clear that the primary defenses currently in use for accused public figures are claiming to be victims of witch hunts and accusing someone else of something (anything will do). It’s the perfect-phone-call/some-people-say-you’re-a-terrible-person strategy.
In normal times, this defense could be very effective. But when you see it over and over again, it gets less convincing. We all hate watching reruns, unless the show is really good.
I suggest a plea of not guilty by reason of bewitchment. Then we might get some legitimate investigation of the American witch/warlock problem. Who are they?
It would be easy to make a joke about Nancy Pelosi or Kelly Conway but that’s too obvious and way too sexist.
No, the witches or warlocks have to be people we wouldn’t suspect but who have daily access to mass media for spellcasting.
Has anyone ever seen Ellen DeGeneres floating?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five dead as volcano erupts in New Zealand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five people have been killed and many more are missing after a volcanic island in New Zealand erupted in a tower of ash and steam while dozens of tourists were exploring the moon-like surface.
The site on White Island was still too dangerous hours later for police and rescuers to search for the missing.
Police deputy commissioner John Tims said the number of those who remained missing was in double figures but he could not confirm an exact number.
He said there were fewer than 50 people on the island and 23 had been taken off, including the five dead.
Mr Tims said experts had told them the island remained unstable but search and rescue teams wanted to get back as quickly as they could.
He said there had been no contact with any of those who were missing.
Mr Tims said both New Zealanders and overseas tourists were among those who were dead, missing or injured.
He said most of the 18 who survived were injured and some had suffered severe burns.
A spokesman for the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said they are seeking "further information" from authorities.
He said: "We are in close contact with the New Zealand authorities following the volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island and are seeking further information."
Some of those involved were guests from the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.
"A number of our guests were touring the island today," the company said.
"We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers."
The cruise ship, which had left from Sydney last week, was scheduled to sail to the capital Wellington on Monday night but the company said it would instead remain in the Tauranga port overnight until it learned more on the situation.
Michael Schade posted video of the eruption on Twitter, saying: "My god. My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it. Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable."
His video showed a wall of ash and steam around the island and a helicopter badly damaged and covered in ash.
He said one woman was badly injured but seemed "strong" by the end.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was travelling to the region late on Monday.
She said the incident was "very significant", adding: "All our thoughts are with those affected."
Brad Scott, a volcanologist with research group GNS Science, said the eruption sent a plume of steam and ash about 12,000ft into the air.
He said it had also affected the whole of the White Island crater floor.
The GeoNet agency, which monitors volcanoes and earthquakes in New Zealand, at first raised its alert level to four, on a scale where five represents a major eruption.
It later dropped the alert level back down to three.
Mr Scott said that was because the eruption was not sustained beyond the initial blast.
White Island sits about 50 kilometres (30 miles) offshore from mainland New Zealand.
Already people are questioning why tourists were still able to visit the island after scientists recently noted an increase in volcanic activity.
GeoNet raised the alert level on White Island from one to two on November 18, noting an increase in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas, which originates from magma deep in the volcano.
It also said at the time that over the previous weeks, the volcanic tremor had increased from weak to moderate strength.
Mr Scott said the alert level was often raised and then later dropped again without any eruption.
He said there had not been any major incidents with tourists visiting the island in the past, although there had been some close calls.
Mr Scott said it was not for him to say whether the island was safe enough to host tourists immediately before Monday's eruption.
Ms Ardern said the focus remained on the search and rescue mission for now and questions about whether tourists should be visiting would be addressed later.
"In the scheme of things, for volcanic eruptions, it is not large," said Ken Gledhill, from GeoNet.
"But if you were close to that, it is not good."
White Island is north east of the town of Tauranga on North Island, one of New Zealand's two main islands.
Police were asking people to avoid areas on the North Island that were close to the eruption, including the Whakatane Heads and Muriwai Drive areas.
GeoNet said White Island is New Zealand's most active cone volcano and about 70% of the volcano is under the sea.
Twelve people were killed on the island in 1914 when it was being mined for sulphur.
Part of a crater wall collapsed and a landslide destroyed the miners' village and the mine itself.
The remains of buildings from another mining enterprise in the 1920s are now a tourist attraction, according to GeoNet.
The island became a private scenic reserve in 1953 and daily tours allow more than 10,000 people to visit the volcano every year.
The island is also known by the indigenous Maori name Whakaari.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thomson bows out</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Thomson has made it official.
Widely rumoured not to be seeking re-election in the next provincial election, Thomson issued a statement Monday confirming so.
“Today, I want to thank my family, colleagues, constituents, and volunteers who have supported me since I first ran to become a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.
“Serving as the MLA for Kelowna-Mission has been the experience of a lifetime, and an absolute honour. However, I have decided that I will not be standing for re-election in the next provincial election. It is now time to pass the torch to the next generation of leadership in Kelowna-Mission.
“Having served as a government minister, a member of the Treasury Board, and even briefly as Speaker of the House, I look forward to sharing everything I have learned in over a decade in politics with those who will put their names forward to seek to represent this great community.
“Thank you again to everyone who supported or accompanied me on this incredible journey. It has been an honour to serve the people of Kelowna-Mission all these years. I look forward to continuing to work hard for the community and for the province until the next election and beyond.”
Thomson, a BC Liberal, was first elected in 2009 and was re-elected in 2013 and 2017. He served as Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and Minister of Agriculture and Lands.
Prior to entering politics, he was executive director of the BC Agriculture Council and general manager of the BC Fruit Growers Association.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India gang-rape shootings revives extrajudicial killing fears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: The shooting of four gang-rape and murder suspects by Indian police has highlighted the scourge of extrajudicial killings in a nation grappling with high levels of sexual crimes and a notoriously slow judicial process.
Authorities claimed the four men were killed in a “shootout” during a re-enactment of the attack, carried out just under two weeks ago, in which a 27-year-old veterinarian was raped and murdered, before her body was burnt.
Police were feted with rose petals, and crowds took to the streets cheering the men’s deaths, saying “swift justice” had been meted out.
“The law has done its duty,” local police chief VC Sajjanar told reporters.
These kind of deaths — dubbed “encounters” in South Asia — where police claim suspects were killed trying to resist arrest or while escaping from custody, are part of a well-worn script trotted out by authorities.
But human rights campaigners warned of a deepening culture of impunity as police take the law into their own hands.
“Over the decades extrajudicial killings and custodial torture have assumed legal sanctity in India,” leading Supreme Court lawyer and founder of the Human Rights Law Network, Colin Gonsalves, told AFP.
“It’s worrying that criminality of the police is now getting public approval.”
After the killings, Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde of the Supreme Court said he had concerns about the use of “instant” justice.
“Justice never ought to be instant. Justice must never ever take the form of revenge. I believe justice loses its character when it becomes revenge,” Bobde said at an event on Saturday.
The “staged shootouts” were for decades used to bypass India’s cumbersome judicial processes when police battled armed separatist movements in West Bengal, Punjab, Kashmir and remote northeastern states.
More recently, the encounters have been deployed against those accused of violent crimes.
In India’s film-loving culture, “encounter specialist” police officers have been idolised by Bollywood.
Scores of movies depict them as tough men and glorify their “kills”, particularly relating to the deaths of hundreds of alleged gang members in Bollywood’s capital Mumbai in the 1990s.
Rights activists say “encounters” are carried out as retribution by police, or used to cover up botched investigations, win awards and rewards, or to pacify a furious public.
According to a government report, 100 suspects were killed in police custody in 2017. None of the 33 policemen arrested for the killings was convicted, it said.
Campaigners say the number of those who actually die at the hands of the police is far higher, with many deaths categorised as suicide or from natural causes.
The Supreme Court attempted to clamp down on the killings in 2014, ordering mandatory probes and barring governments from rewarding officers before determining how and why the shootings occurred.
The court is currently monitoring probes into cases from northeastern Manipur state where rights groups allege that 1,530 suspects have been killed by police since 2007.
It is also hearing a petition on the “staged killings” of at least 58 suspects in Uttar Pradesh since 2017 after the state government adopted what it called “no-mercy” tactics to battle crime.
Home Minister Amit Shah has said his government would not tolerate police atrocities. He himself was cleared of charges relating to the 2005 extrajudicial killing of a gangster and his wife when he was Gujarat state’s home minister.
Police have long been criticised for not preventing violent crimes or for failing to bring cases, particularly sexual assaults, to the courts.
The justice system is also cumbersome and slow, with some rape and murder cases taking years or even decades to reach their conclusion.
India has a backlog of some 30 million cases, of which nearly 150,000 relate to sexual assault.
The conviction rate for rape stands at 32 per cent, and victims also have to endure bungled police investigations and threats by perpetrators.
Analysts say the lack of justice for victims has fuelled public acceptance of extrajudicial executions.
Activist Mihir Desai said rape cases have become symbolic of the rot in the criminal justice system, where constitutional rights of both victims and offenders are violated.
“This somehow reflects the justice delivery system and how the state is failing its citizens,” said Desai, whose rights group the People’s Union for Civil Liberties has mounted several court cases against arbitrary police killings.
“The young woman didn’t get justice and the slain men won’t get it too.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">BuzzFeed UK threatened with being dissolved over late accounts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BuzzFeed UK has been told it will be dissolved in two months if it fails to file its accounts with Companies House.
The warning comes after the online media organisation missed a deadline at the end of September to submit its financial information for 2018.
On Monday, a “First Gazette” notice was issued for a compulsory strike-off.
The notice says: “The Registrar of Companies gives notice that, unless cause is shown to the contrary, the company will be struck off the register and dissolved not less than two months from (December 10).”
Julie Palmer, insolvency expert at Begbies Traynor, said: “Receiving a notice like this is more common than you might think, but it’s not often a cause for concern without any clear reasons behind it.”
These could include extending the company’s accounting period, although Companies House must still be informed, and most experts agree an accounting extension is typically a sign of financial difficulties.
The period covered in the late BuzzFeed UK accounts covers a difficult year for the business, with revenues failing to match expectations.
In January this year, founder and chief executive Jonah Peretti announced that 15% of the workforce worldwide would be laid off to cut costs.
It came weeks after UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson stepped down after three-and-a-half years in charge and followed calls from staff to unionise.
BuzzFeed, which was launched in the US in 2006, attempted a major overseas expansion in recent years. But it subsequently retrenched, along with cutting back its US operations.
Despite heavy cuts to its UK workforce, it has managed to bag some major scoops and awards, including being named news website of the year in 2018.
BuzzFeed UK also uncovered a series of troubling deaths of Russians in the UK, leading to the reopening of police investigations, and reporters also exposed a series of issues at the Department of Justice.
A spokeswoman for BuzzFeed UK said accounts would be filed “soon” but declined to specify.
In 2017 the business made a pre-tax loss of £1.9 million on turnover of £33.4 million, although the accounts said it continues to be financially supported by its US parent company.
In 2016 it made a pre-tax loss of £3.3 million on revenues of £20.5 million.

    <h5 class="mb-1">4-year-old twins free selves, climb to safety after dad dies in car crash</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SEATTLE (AP/Gray News) — Washington state authorities say 4-year-old twins freed themselves from their car seats and climbed an embankment seeking help following a car crash that killed their father.
KING-TV reported 47-year-old Corey Simmons of Langley died when the vehicle with his daughters in the backseat crashed into trees and down the embankment on Whidbey Island around 6 p.m. Friday.
Family members say the girls released themselves from their car seats and crawled out of the car before climbing about 200 feet (61 meters) up to the road after the accident 34 miles (55 kilometers) north of Seattle.
Police say the girls were transported to a hospital with minor injuries after an unidentified woman passing in her car went back to help and called 911.
Trooper Heather Axtman, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Patrol, described the area as very rural and said the chances that anyone would drive by and see the girls “was truly the right time at the right place” type of thing, according to CNN.
“We are so incredibly thankful," said Rebecah Crider, sister to the twin girls and Simmons’ stepdaughter. "We would love to personally meet her and thank her.”
The twins’ mother, Esther Crider, said the girls are traumatized by what happened, KING reports.
Axtman called the girls “extremely heroic and brave," noting how they were so young but able to find their way from the crash in the cold and dark, according to CNN.
“The bravery that these two little girls showed was incredible,” she said.
Authorities say Simmons was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash. The accident is under investigation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">World-leading animal trainer wows Zoo staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hamilton Zoo hosted a training event of a unique kind from 27-29 November, led by internationally renowned animal trainer, Peter Giljam from Zoospensefull, currently based in Sweden.
This was Peter’s second visit to Hamilton Zoo – in 2018, he held a series of workshops which were so well received, staff were determined to find a way for him to return.
They did so by inviting zookeepers and animal trainers from across the country, sharing the cost around. 30 individuals took up the offer, with representatives from Auckland, Wellington, Orana and Brooklands zoos, as well as staff from Kelly Tarlton’s Aquarium. A further 40 staff from Hamilton Zoo participated.
The three-day event focused on animal training with a blend of theory-based presentations and workshops along with practical sessions within various enclosures at Hamilton Zoo.
The sessions were geared at improving the animal/trainer connection, understanding animal queues (like widened eyes and quickened breath) and gradually shaping behaviour to establish routines and keep animals and staff safe.
Team Leader of birds and ectotherms at Hamilton Zoo, Grant Kother says: “It was a real privilege to have Peter with us for the second year in a row, albeit with a much larger group this time.
“Training animals is complex work – there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach and sometimes the most effective techniques run counter to what feels instinctive for us as humans.
“Peter has a reputation as one of the best in his field for good reason – a charismatic teacher, he has a hands-on approach which means staff get to put skills into practice in the moment, building confidence.
“We covered a lot of ground over the three days, starting with the basics like teaching animals to stay still for an extended period to help with vet checks and reinforcing certain behaviours using positive reinforcement, timing and setting up the environment to help the animal succeed.
“One of my personal highlights was learning about systems that will help us work more effectively as a team.
“The learning never ends for an animal trainer and I’m proud to be part of a team that embraces a growth mindset and inspires others to do the same.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Successful water action flotilla at Lyttelton Port</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fifteen kayaks, a yacht, and a ferry filled with over a hundred local school children joined the peace flotilla this morning at Lyttelton Port, Christchurch. They were encouraged from the land by approximately 80 human rights activists, who sang Saharawi songs of freedom. The action was to "unwelcome" the bulk carrying cargo ship the "Federal Crimson", as it arrived in Lyttelton carrying 50,000 tonnes of 'blood phosphate' from the occupied territory of Western Sahara. Christchurch group, ‘Ravensdown- Take ‘Em Down’ organised the water flotilla, inspired by the Peace Squadrons - which were instrumental in the NZ Nuclear Free campaign. Christchurch resident Catherline Low stated "I'm horrified that New Zealand companies are supporting human rights abuses by buying this phosphate. It has got to stop". Local organiser Josie Butler reports "Ravensdown are funding war crimes. We are here today to demand Ravensdown's CEO Greg Campbell to cease this internationally illegal import immediately".
The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union boarded the ship on arrival, issuing a letter of protest to the Captain of the ship. This comes following the Council of Trade Unions' resolution which was passed last month, condemning Morocco's illegal occupation of Western Sahara and calling upon the New Zealand government to halt importation of phosphate from the area. Dunedin based ‘Environmental Justice Ōtepoti’ are planning a barbecue to celebrate how far the campaign has come this year.
Morocco invaded Western Sahara in 1975 and have been exploiting the countries natural resources ever since. 173,000 Saharawi live in a refugee camp in Tindouf, Algeria. The government of Western Sahara, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, is recognised by 80 states, but not by New Zealand.
MINURSO; The United Nations mission for a peaceful resolution for the people of Western Sahara has so far failed to achieve the referendum that the Saharawi people are waiting for. New Zealand fertilizer companies Ravensdown and Ballance are being criticized for purchasing from Moroccan controlled phosphate exporter, OCP. “Every shipment purchased gives more reason for the occupying power to remain and delays a peaceful outcome for the Saharawi people.” said Rose Murphy of Environmental Justice Ōtepoti.
Mahmoud Lemadel is a journalist and activist living in El Aiuin within the occupied area. Mahmoud has thrown his support behind the planned protests. “ My dream of living in peace as a young man living in occupied territory is being stolen by the international companies who are funding the illegal plunder of my country. Among these dreams thieves are companies from New Zealand - Ravensdown and Ballance. These companies are supporting the presence of occupation in my country" said Lemadel.
“Ravensdown are ignoring the requests of the Saharawi people and their government to stop purchasing from OCP. Ravensdown justify their ongoing involvement by claiming the purchasing of blood phosphate benefits local people. This ignores the reality in the refugee camps and the violence and oppression experienced by Saharawi’s living in the occupied area,” said Rose Murphy. “Our groups have been in close contact with and are working alongside the Saharawi people to ensure their voices are heard.”
Earlier this year, 24 year old English teacher Sabah Osman was killed by Moroccan police while she celebrated Algeria’s victory in the football tournament, Africa Cup of Nations.“We intend to remember Sabah Osman at our event this week,” said Rose Murphy.
“It is shameful that Ravensdown continues to silence and erase the suffering of the people of Western Sahara. They (Ravensdown) are aware that this operation is a violation of human rights. The people of Western Sahara have a right to sovereignty. Ravensdown are complicit in allowing the military occupation to continue,” Murphy said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Road linking Timaru and Ashburton reopening midday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Road crews have worked long hours overnight to make progress on reopening a road link between Timaru and Ashburton.
Timaru District, which manages Route 72, the Upper Rangitata River at the Arundel bridge, is reopening that road at midday today.
• Speed restrictions will be in place and, due to the backlog of traffic in both directions, we expect travel times between Timaru and Christchurch to be significantly longer than normal. Travellers should add at least an extra hour to their travel times, and expect delays. • There are very limited services on this route via the Arundel bridge so people are asked to carry water and food.• There will be localised detours in place from Orari where there is a single lane bridge. Police will be present along the route.State Highway 1 over the Rangitata River bridge will stay closed today.
“State Highway 1 will not open today at the Rangitata bridge given the amount of water which has broken through stopbanks and needs to be redirected,” says Pete Connors, System Manager for Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency.

South Westland, SH6 – top and bottom access essential services, progress this week at each end
In South Westland, crews are beginning to tackle multiple slips on the Fox Hills, between the two glacier townships. It is hoped this area of highway will be open by the end of this week, says Mr Connors.
“The area around Whataroa at Mt Hercules is where we have the most slips, and we are aiming to have services reconnected for Christmas if not shortly after Christmas.”
• SH6 through South Westland is closed north of Haast and south of Harihari.• Residents and essential services can go south of Hokitika to Harihari. • Harihari to Whataroa will take longer to clear.• The road between the two glacier towns, Fox and Franz Josef, through the Fox Hills is being targeted to open by the end of this week. There are four or five slips along this section of road.• People can get between Haast and Makarora in Otago daytime hours 10 am to 4 pm, essential services and residents. Work on a slip at Clarke Bluff is continuing outside these hours this week.• Apart from South Westland, the West Coast’s other highways through the Otira Gorge, north to Punakaiki and Buller District and south to Hokitika are open for business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Safety first following Nelson road safety operation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Please attribute to Tasman Road Policing Manager Senior Sergeant Grant Andrews:
Nelson Police are urging people to put safety first following a weekend road safety operation.
Police set up a number of checkpoints across the district on Friday and Saturday focusing on impaired drivers.
Nelson City Council also joined the checkpoints and handed out chocolate Santas to sober drivers and passengers.
Over 2200 drivers were breath tested over the two nights.
Five drivers are facing prosecution for driving with excess breath alcohol, a further six drivers have had infringement notices issued and are forbidden to drive.
“The number of people driving impaired is disappointing and indicates people are not planning ahead to get themselves and other road users home safely,” Tasman Road Policing Manager Senior Sergeant Grant Andrews says.
“One of the drivers facing prosecution had been at a work function and the employer had arranged for prepaid taxis and a courtesy coach.
However, the person still chose to drive," sSenior Sergeant Andrews says.
“It’s clear that the message is not getting through to some drivers and they are choosing to place themselves and other road users at significant risk.
There simply isn’t any excuse for this behaviour.”
People need to make a plan when socialising and that should include for the following morning when they still may have alcohol in their system placing them over the limit.
Passengers also have a role to play – if your driver is impaired, take their keys and don’t get in the car.
If you are in any doubt at all about being safe or legal to drive after drinking, don’t drive.
Police will continue to carry out operations such as this leading into Christmas and throughout summer.
“Drivers can expect to see a greater presence on the roads and expect to be breath tested.
We want people to be able to have a safe and enjoyable Christmas.
That means all road users being responsible and looking out for each other.
"Always wear your seatbelt, put your phone away before you start driving and focus on what you’re doing, always drive to the conditions and within the speed limit, and never ever drive impaired by drugs, alcohol or fatigue.
It’s not worth your life or anyone else’s.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">SC Issues Notice On TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Plea To Direct ECI To Publish Final Vote Counts Of General Elections</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Supreme Court today issued notice to the Election Commission of India on a plea by TMC MP Mahua Moitra seeking directions to the poll body to publish details of voter turnout and final vote counts on their website.
Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayan appearing for Moitra informed the court that Form 17C part I, 17C part II and Form 20 are prepared under the Conduct of Election Rules 1961 to record information regarding total votes recorded, result of counting and final result sheet respectively. It was also submitted that the practice of publishing Form 20 has been around since 2004, but was discontinued during the 2019 general elections. The allegation levied is that Form 20 was being published till the first four phases, but the poll body stopped doing so for the fifth, sixth and seventh phases in the wake of discrepancies emerging between the total votes polled and total votes counted on EVMs. Upon being questioned by the bench, comprising of CJI SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, whether this was only the case only in Bengal, Sankaranarayanan informed that the petitioner was an MP from West Bengal, but that should not be confused with the plea which is regarding all of India.
CJI Bobde also asked if the publishing of the Forms was mandated by the Election Manual.
With regard to this aspect, the petition invokes Article 19(1)(a) to state that the right to know and receive information about the integrity of the electoral process mandates a direction from court to the poll body to formulate a protocol for publishing this information. It has further been submitted that these are statutory forms which the poll body is under no legal obligation to publish, however it does have a Constitutional duty under Article 324 to ensure the credibility of the election process is upheld and democracy is allowed to thrive. Accountability and transparency of the election process has been cited to urge the court to direct the ECI to come up with a protocol for publishing these forms, which in turn are used to tally information during elections. It has further been prayed that information regarding Form 17C part I and 17C part II (total voter turnout and total votes cast) in every subsequent parliamentary and assembly election must be published on the ECI website within 48 hours of them being created, and Form 20 (the final result sheet) must be published in 7 days after it's readied.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Magnum Reloaded: ‘Blood brothers’ reunite to help a buddy on ‘Magnum P.I.’ | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most people know that when a Hawaiian says you are part of their ʻohana, they do not say this lightly. ʻOhana means family, but sometimes “family” can simply be friends who have been with you through the best and worst of times. In this week’s “Magnum P.I.”, Magnum (Jay Hernandez), Rick (Zachary Knighton), and TC (Stephen Hill) risk everything to help Nuzo’s (Domenick Lombardozzi) brother Paulie (Louis Lombardi) rescue Ahmed (Mohit Gautam) an Afghan boy Paulie grew close to when they were all stationed in Afghanistan seven years before.
The title of the episode, “Blood Brothers,” definitely encapsulates the overall theme threaded throughout the storyline. When Paulie arrives at Rick’s La Mariana, he asks the guys to help him get Ahmed off a container ship heading toward Oahu. Paulie is trying to sneak the teenager into America and away from the Taliban who killed his mother and his adopted family. While they all work to find him, with a bit of help from Higgins (Perdita Weeks) and Katsumoto (Tim Kang), Magnum recalls the team’s tour in Afghanistan when they met Ahmed and his mother.
Written by Peter Lenkov and Eric Guggenheim and directed Peter Weller, the episode delivers strong performances from the main cast as well as special guest star Lombardi. And Lombardozzi’s return as Nuzo in well-placed flashbacks is always welcome. Lombardozzi, whose character, unfortunately, was murdered in the pilot “I Saw the Sun Rise,” consistently delivers a solid performance and he helps add Magnum’s backstory.
The entire episode was expertly paced as the tension and need to find Ahmed after he is forced to leave the container ship, and then kidnapped by human traffickers, added to the intensity of the episode. And when the team finally finds the boy, the true emotion expressed by all of the actors was natural and believable. Overall, this episode was one of the strongest of the season thus far.
YOU BLEED, I BLEED
The idea that Magnum, Rick, TC, and Nuzo are truly blood brothers after surviving war and 18 months and 11 days in a POW camp, is definitely brought to the forefront in this episode. As Magnum reminds Nuzo in the flashbacks “You bleed, I bleed,” he says. It means more than just literal bleeding for each other — it’s about having each other’s backs, and supporting them no matter where the mission takes them.
The episode flips back and forth between Thomas and the team looking for Ahmed in the present time, after he is forced off of the container ship when ICE arrives to search it, and flashbacks to the team’s time in Afghanistan when Ahmed was nine-years-old. Magnum is teaching him English, while Rick and TC show him their mean tetherball moves, and they all rally around him as Paulie loans him his Yankees cap and shows him how to throw some heat and strike Magnum out. They are sweet and funny scenes that help alleviate all the palpable sadness when Ahmed’s mother is killed and when they cannot find him once he makes it to Oahu.
Paulie is Nuzo’s older brother who works for a contracting company in the motor pool at their base. He specifically took the job to be closer to Nuzo as he served overseas. When Paulie doesn’t return to the base after going to visit Ahmed and his mother, Nuzo asks Magnum, Rick, and TC to help him. When they find Ahmed’s town deserted, they search the mountains and find his mother among all the dead. They barely make it back, and when they do, Paulie’s been shot in the leg, and all four are in front of Capt. Greene (James Remar) to be disciplined.
TAKING A HELPING HAND
Of course, they survive to fight another day, and that day comes when Paulie arrives to ask them to help find Ahmed. And when Ahmed is tricked into leaving a homeless camp by a group of human traffickers, it takes reaching out to Paulie’s contact who got Ahmed on the container ship — Gerard Hirsch (Willie Garson). Many fans know Garson’s character from “Hawaii Five-0.” Hirsch is a former art dealer and smuggler who knows how to get “art, vehicles, even people on and off the island.” Hirsch who “hates to be the good guy” gives up the name of the human trafficker who he thinks most likely kidnapped Ahmed once he got off of the container ship and landed on a beach on Oahu.
Magnum also takes Higgins’ advice and reaches out to Katsumoto — who is willing to help if he can do it properly, as he is still under review with HPD. And he wants to help as his grandfather came to Hawaii illegally and he believes “in what that statue in New York says.”
BLOOD BROTHERS
The team, with the help of Katsumoto and HPD, rescues Ahmed. It is a bittersweet reunion, especially when Ahmed asks about Nuzo. As they all look away, Paulie tells him that “he would’ve been here if he could.” The pain of losing Nuzo is all over their faces but it passes as they are relieved to find Paulie’s boy.
The hardest moment had to be when Magnum talks to Nuzo in a picture of the team hanging in La Mariana, “I wish you could’ve been with us today. It was like like old times. You bleed, I bleed. And, listen, if, uh if Paulie ever needs us again, we got his back.” This is confirmed when Paulie tells them, “When my brother died, I thought I didn’t have a family anymore. But I was wrong. You guys are my brothers.” He says the truth about all of the characters — they are certainly brothers until the end.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oklahoma City nonprofit raises funds to serve human trafficking survivors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dragonfly Home, a metro-area nonprofit that helps human trafficking survivors, is holding its third annual “Drive for Dragonfly” fundraiser.
Dragonfly operates Oklahoma’s only state-certified human trafficking crisis center and is working to open a sex trafficking shelter in Oklahoma City.
Since receiving state certification from the Attorney General’s Office in November 2016, Dragonfly has served more than 300 victim-survivors of sex and labor trafficking, and fielded more than 3,000 calls to its 24-hour helpline.
The fundraising effort is led by Maddie McNeill, a recent University of Oklahoma graduate, and Rebecca Jakopin and Shary Bouvette, two current OU students.
McNeill said she was inspired to start Drive for Dragonfly while studying social work.
“I wanted to uncover human trafficking and raise awareness that people are trafficked every single day here in Oklahoma,” she said. “The human trafficking survivors getting help at The Dragonfly Home are real people who have gone through real trauma — awful, unspeakable things that people should never have to go through.”
In 2017, the fundraising campaign raised more than $7,500. In 2018, the campaign raised more than $17,000.
Through Dec. 31, Drive for Dragonfly participants create a personalized fundraising page through the nonprofit’s website and share the link on social media. Participants also wear a temporary tattoo every day in December as a symbol of Drive for Dragonfly.
“The Drive for Dragonfly leaders chose a temporary tattoo to represent the ‘branding’ that traffickers often use to demonstrate control over the person they are trafficking,” said Whitney Anderson, a co-founder and the executive director of Dragonfly. “At Dragonfly, we stand against the idea that human beings are for sale. Our temporary tattoos for Drive for Dragonfly declare that everyone deserves ‘A Future of Freedom.’”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Related coverage
U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe and U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn leveled harsh criticism last week at the contractor accused of negligence and fraudulent activity while operating private housing at Tinker Air Force Base and other military installations.
Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, referred to Balfour Beatty Communities as “notorious.” Horn, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told a company executive she was “incredibly disappointed you have failed to live up to your responsibility for taking care of the people that are living in these houses.”
At a hearing of his committee, Inhofe asked Air Force Secretary Barbara M. Barrett, “If you have a repeater like this and misconduct like this, why is it that they are still there?
“What do we have to do? How do you pull a plug? How do you get that done?”
Barrett said, “That company received a letter of concern from the Air Force expressing that the Air Force has lost confidence in their ability to perform under their contract. That letter was issued in September.
“Since that time, they have not been receiving performance incentive fees. Since that time, all of their contracts — they have the contract on many bases — all of their performance fees have been withheld.
“So they are under financial penalty right now. In addition to that, it has been requested that they submit an action plan for what they will be doing. That plan is due by the end of the year, and there will be metrics and accountability from that plan or the Air Force will be initiating the elements accessible to us under the dispute resolution procedures, which could lead to anything up to a default on their lease.”
Inhofe, R-Tulsa, has held several hearings and visited Tinker repeatedly since reports from Reuters and other news outlets documented severe problems, including mold and insect infestation, at military family housing.
Residents of the base, located in Oklahoma County, complained that company officials were dismissive and that problems were rarely fixed. Balfour Beatty Communities operates about 600 units on Tinker and 43,000 on bases nationally.
Regarding the problem nationally, lawmakers, base commanders and service officials have pleaded ignorance, saying oversight has been limited since housing contracts were given to private companies.
Inhofe and Horn backed provisions in the annual defense bill that would give residents more rights and impose standard measurements for private housing companies’ performance. The military also will be required to conduct more oversight of housing. The defense bill may come up for a final vote this week.
Horn, D-Oklahoma City, said she first heard of the conditions early this year from a military family member at Tinker.
“I was angry and frustrated and hoping it was a limited problem but, sadly, found out it was not,” Horn told Richard C. Taylor, a Balfour Beatty Communities executive, at a hearing of the Armed Services subcommittee on Readiness last week.
“Infestations are rampant across Tinker. And it’s one of those things that’s so outrageous to me that we’re not taking care of service members and their families.”
At the hearing, Horn showed an enlarged photo of extensive mold in a Tinker home managed by Balfour Beatty Communities.
“That picture is unacceptable,” Taylor said. “Absolutely unacceptable.”
Horn referenced reports by Reuters and CBS News that Balfour Beatty Communities had falsified maintenance logs at Tinker to make it appear requests were handled more quickly than they were. She asked Taylor if the company would apply corporate incentive payments received during that time to housing repairs.
Taylor said the company was working with the U.S. Department of Justice on its inquiry and had hired an outside company to investigate the allegations.
“In the event that we are found to have falsified records then we are absolutely committed to refunding any incentive fees received back to those projects,” Taylor told the subcommittee.
Taylor said he endorsed the national defense bill provisions, including the tenants’ bill of rights. Leaders from other private housing contractors testified at the subcommittee that they were also working on improvements.
U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., chairman of the Readiness subcommittee, visited Tinker earlier this year with Horn. He said last week the companies have had enough time to scrutinize their own conduct and must now act.
“We ask our service members and their families to sacrifice enough in service to their country, we will not ask them to accept sub-standard housing as well,” he said.
“They deserve better and this committee will demand that they get it.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 1,500 cubic yards of concrete slurry, delivered by 150 trucks, was poured overnight Friday for the foundation of a new entrance and exit ramp tower that will provide access to structured parking as part of the redevelopment of First National Center.
Demolition of the 1971 First National annex facing Broadway started in July 2018 and wrapped over the summer.
Developer Gary Brooks said the late-hour pour was scheduled to avoid traffic hassles and other inconveniences to downtown workers, visitors and residents as a result of the large line-up of trucks.
The new tower will connect to the 1957 annex facing Park Avenue that is being converted into parking. The first two floors will be rebuilt as a retail gallery.
All of this work is part of a $250 million redevelopment of the original Art Deco First National tower built in 1931 which is being converted into housing, retail and a hotel. Brooks said the garage will be the first part of the project to open with a date set for early 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stitt appoints corrections director</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gov. Kevin Stitt on Friday appointed a new director to oversee the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, following the previous director's abrupt departure.
Scott Crow, who has been with the department for more than 20 years and served as interim director since June, will lead the state agency that oversees Oklahoma’s correctional facilities.
The department's previous director, Joe Allbaugh, abruptly resigned at a Board of Corrections meeting in June. At the time, Crow, who served as the department’s chief of operations, stepped into the interim director role.
In a news release, Stitt praised Crow for his strong leadership at the agency leading up to when Oklahoma released more than 450 low-level, nonviolent drug and property crime offenders last month.
“Crow successfully led the agency to accomplish major initiatives, such as the inaugural re-entry fairs ahead of the HB 1269 commutation release," Stitt said. "Crow is strengthening morale among employees and setting goals to modernize operations, and he is the right person to receive the appointment to be the next director of ODOC.”
Crow joined the department as a special investigator supervisor in 1996. Before that, he worked in local law enforcement in southwest Oklahoma. He was the assistant police chief in Cache and served as a captain in the Comanche County Sheriff's Department.
“This is a post I accept with humility, a sense of duty, no illusions of the work that lies ahead — and an eye toward what works in corrections," Crow said.
The Corrections Department has more than 4,300 employees at 24 facilities across the state. The corrections system is currently home to about 25,000 inmates with another 31,000 people under community supervision.
Crow's appointment is contingent on approval from the state Senate.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Related coverage
U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn faced frustrated constituents on Sunday at a town hall meeting, where people voiced anger over impeachment and the lack of accomplishments the divided government has produced this year.
“As an independent voter, I think you’re in a lot of trouble if you vote for this impeachment,” Susan Jaslow, of Edmond, told Horn.
Ronda Peterson, of Edmond, who identified herself as a conservative, said Congress had been consumed all year with impeaching President Donald Trump.
“We want Congress to get back to work for the American people, please,” Peterson said.
Horn, D-Oklahoma City, who had earlier reiterated her position that she hasn’t made up her mind on impeachment, told Peterson, “It’s frustrating for me. Because that’s not what I’m doing on a day-to-day basis. I didn’t run to impeach anybody. I ran to fight for Oklahoma, for education, for health care … and that’s where I’ve been spending my time.”
Horn's district includes most of Oklahoma County and Pottawatomie and Seminole counties. She held the town hall meeting on Sunday at Santa Fe South High School in south Oklahoma City.
Horn is one of about 30 Democrats who represent districts that favored Trump in 2016. A freshman who scored an upset victory last year, she is considered among the most vulnerable House Democrats going into 2020. Eight Republicans have already announced they would run for the seat.
Two Republican-aligned groups have financed recent ad campaigns attacking Horn's voting record and urging people to call her office to express opposition to impeachment.
Horn voted last month to extend the impeachment inquiry into a public phase. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment soon, and a full House vote may come before Christmas. If Trump is impeached, the Senate would hold a trial.
The House has been investigating whether Trump conditioned military aid to Ukraine on whether that country looked into potential corruption involving the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat who may be Trump’s rival for the presidency next year.
Horn has sponsored legislation on student loans, prescription drugs, mental health, defense and other topics but acknowledged Sunday that impeachment was taking up “most of the air in the room.”
She blamed the media in part, saying “it’s just easier to cover those things that fire people up and divide them.”
One audience member noted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, had refused to consider dozens of bills approved by the House, which is controlled by Democrats, and asked whether the rules could be changed.
Horn, referring to the fact that Trump opposed many of the Democratic bills, said work on legislation should be conducted whether the president opposes it or not.
“It’s not a vertical reporting structure,” she said. “We’re co-equal branches. … There’s not a lot we can do at this moment but continue to advocate for the Senate to take up some of the bills.”
The House this week is expected to vote on a bill aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Horn told reporters the bill was “a good start” and she expected to vote for it.
“It contains some provisions that will move us down the road to helping address the astronomical cost of prescription drugs, including the bill that I introduced to cap the out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare Part D at $2,000 per year, which would save them $3,100 per year,” she said.
Responding to a reporter’s question about the potential political cost of impeachment, Horn said, “When I am making any decision, the thing that is first and foremost is my oath to protect and defend the Constitution, to protect our systems … and to look at every issue that comes in front of me with scrutiny, not through the lens of a partisan issue, as a Democrat or a Republican, but: Is it the right thing to do?”
Jaslow said she was a part of a big group of independent voters in Edmond who were upset about impeachment. Jaslow said she voted for Horn last year.
“If she votes for impeachment, she’s screwed,” Jaslow said.

Police say the arrests included 11 people detained in raids over the weekend that netted a pistol and other weapons. Police suspect the weapons were intended for use during a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands of peaceful marchers on Sunday.
Police also arrested 12 people on Monday suspected of preparing gasoline bombs.
Police said they have also fired 10,000 rubber baton rounds during the six months of protests and that 493 officers have been injured.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday resigned as the Congress Legislature Party leader, taking moral responsibility for the party's poor show in the assembly bypolls.
The Congress, which held 12 of the 15 seats where byelections were held on December five, won only two, in a huge set-back to the opposition party.
In a letter to Interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Siddaramaiah expressed his sincere regrets for not being able to give "satisfactory results" in the byelections.
"I deem it necessary to step down as Leader of the CLP by taking moral responsibility", he wrote.
"As a CLP leader, there is a need to uphold the democratic principles. In the interest of the party, I have tendered my resignation as the CLP leader", Siddaramaiah told reporters.
The byelection was seen as much a litmus test for Siddaramaiah as it was for Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Road accident claims 12 lives in Niger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Niger says 12 people have died in an accident on Sunday at Sawmill village along Mokwa -Makera road in Mokwa Local Government Area of the state.
The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Mr Joel Dagwa, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Minna that the accident involved a Truck Container with registration No. KJ 555 XX heading to Lagos.
Dagwa said that the Truck that came from Maiduguri, picked passengers from Zaria in Kaduna State before heading to Lagos.
” The accident involved 103 people, 55 females, 40 males, 8 children’s, 5 adults, 12 of them were killed while 91 sustained injuries and taken to Mokwa general hospital for treatment.
“All the 12 corpses have been deposited at the hospital’s morgue,” he said.
He blamed the accident on speeding on a sharp bend corner of the road.
The sector commander said that the Corps would continue to monitor road users to guard against overloading and dangerous driving.
” We have since embarked on aggressive patrols across all major highways to ensure that road users adhere strictly to traffic rules and regulations to avoid road accidents before, during and after the Christmas and New year festivities,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Falana insists Sowore was assaulted by DSS inside court</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Femi Falana (SAN) on Monday insisted that Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore was assaulted inside the court contrary to the claims by the Department of State Service (DSS).
“We have already identified those involved in this act of gangsterism,” Falana said during a Television Continental (TVC) programme ‘Your View’.
“We know them. They know I know all of them.”
In a video shared by his Sahara Reporters on Friday, Sowore was seen being dragged by several men in an Abuja courtroom. Sahara Reporters said some of the men in the video were operatives of the DSS.
But the DSS on Saturday denied rearresting Sowore in the courtroom.
“The DSS, as a professional, responsible and law abiding organization, could not have invaded a courtroom including the one presided over by a respected Judge who is not only handling its case but whose Order was unconditionally obeyed within a 24-hour ultimatum,” Afunanya said,” DSS spokesman Peter Afunanya said in a statement.
“Its (DSS) personnel were never, at any time, involved in the incident.”
Afunanya said the court had adjourned peacefully without an untoward incident when suddenly the unruly crowd imported into the courtroom went into a frenzy on the mere suspicion that DSS officials were seen at the court premises.
Although contrary to reports, Afunanya said, “the eventual re-arrest of Sowore by the DSS was effected outside the courtroom.”
But Falana said Sowore’s rearrest ‘inside the court’ was acknowledged by the head of DSS team inside Justice Ijeoma’s office.
“The judge summoned the DSS leader to her office and challenged him (on the incident) and he apologised profusely right in her office in my presence,” Falana said.
He described the DSS’s claim of arresting Sowore outside the court as a “reckless lie.”
Countering the DSS claim, Falana posited that if truly “Sowore’s arrest was stage-managed by his supporters assaulting him in court, was the DSS not supposed to protect him.”
The Nigerian government in a statement on Sunday said Sowore “is a person of interest to the DSS” because he called for “a revolution to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nigeria.”
But Falana said the government’s claim is a media trial which is far from the truth.
“No responsible government can expose its citizen to a media trial. Let them bring their evidence.”
Sowore is being charged on offences of treasonable felony, money laundering, terrorism and plotting to overthrow Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari after calling for a nationwide protest tagged RevolutioNow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Watch: Buttigieg on the defensive, Biden's strategy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) - Presidential politics move fast. What we're watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:
___
Days to Iowa caucuses: 56
Days to general election: 330
___
THE NARRATIVE
The Republican president is likely to be impeached, but Democrats are further away from rallying behind one nominee (or two) than they've ever been, even after California Sen. Kamala Harris' sudden departure. The top tier still features four - former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren - while billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is building a massive political machine spanning 30 states that threatens to prolong the Democratic nomination fight well past March.
___
THE BIG QUESTIONS
- Can Pete take the heat?
Buttigieg has been forced on the defensive in recent days over questions about transparency. It's been a long time coming for the 37-year-old, who has largely escaped the kind of scrutiny that typically comes with top-tier status. This week, he'll have to answer more tough questions about his fundraising operation and, perhaps more importantly, his private-sector work. Buttigieg has said for weeks that he'd open his fundraising events to the press, just as other candidates do, yet he's scheduled to have another round of closed-door meetings with donors this week. The bigger issue is the secrecy surrounding his client list during his time at powerhouse consulting firm McKinsey. He released a general summary of his work late last week, saying that only the firm can reveal the specifics. We'll see if the political world is satisfied with the summary. Count us skeptical.
- Did Biden's bus tour change anything?
The former vice president enters the week fresh off an eight-day bus tour across Iowa, which was by far his most aggressive retail campaign push of the year. He had been stuck in a glut of candidates near the top of the field in the kickoff caucus state before the tour. We'll be paying close attention to any new signs of movement. Biden's advisers have sought to downplay expectations in the state, but the marathon bus tour makes it hard to believe that they don't see a strong showing in Iowa as critical to his strategy.
- Debate stage so white?
As of today, not a single black candidate has qualified for the party's final debate of the year. With Harris' exit from the race, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and newcomer Deval Patrick, a former Massachusetts governor, are the only black candidates left, and Booker is the only one with a chance to meet the rising thresholds from the Democratic National Committee. It doesn't look good. By the end of Thursday, he needs four polls hitting either 4% nationally or 6% in an early voting state. Andrew Yang, an Asian American businessman, would be the only non-white candidate to make the cut if he hits one more qualifying poll. And Julián Castro, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the only Hispanic candidate in the race, isn't expected to qualify either. For a party that badly needs to energize African Americans and other minority voters heading into 2020, an all-white stage could be a problem.
- Is Trump's swing state free pass coming to an end?
As Democrats focus on their primary, the president continues to try to make the most of his uncontested access to top general election swing states. He'll host another rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, part of his focus on Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to close out the year. One thing has changed in recent days, however. Bloomberg has ratcheted up his advertising campaign in all 50 states, including those three. He's also hiring teams of political operatives on the ground there. It's part of a strategy Bloomberg's team says will keep him competitive in the Democratic primary and simultaneously prevent Trump from getting a free pass in general election battlegrounds for several months. It's an ambitious strategy to say the least, but if anybody has the money to do it it's Bloomberg. He's spent more than $60 million on ads in the last two weeks alone.
- Does Bernie have an edge in Nevada?
Sanders has kept his head down in recent days, but he and his grassroots supporters are positioned to be a force early in the primary season, particularly in those states with lower-turnout caucuses. Look no further than Nevada, which holds the third voting contest and will play host to the Vermont senator for at least two days this week. He won't have the state to himself. Warren and Biden are scheduled to campaign in the state this week as well.
___
THE FINAL THOUGHT
It may not feel like it, but the Democratic field is starting to winnow. As of Monday, just six candidates have qualified for next week's debate. Another two more are close, but remember that there were 12 onstage in October. With perhaps Bloomberg being an exception, those candidates who don't qualify for debates are effectively eliminated from serious contention, no matter how they try to spin it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inside the estate where 'hundreds of kids are starving and mums live off energy drinks'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of children are starving on the streets of one of the poorest housing estates in Wales - and their mums are living off energy drinks so they can feed them - a charity has claimed.
The Given to Shine charity, which takes food to deprived areas of Wrexham, is now delivering half of its 200 parcels a week to struggling families on the Caia Park estate. 
A spokeswoman for the charity told North Wales Live. they were giving food to 600 people on the estate - 450 of which were children. 
"We are seeing mums in hospital," she said. 
"They are living off energy drinks just so their children can eat. It is heartbreaking.
"We have definitely seen a massive increase since the summer months. The little amount people earn is having to spent on energy bills."
The Queensway 1 area in Caia Park, Wrexham was recently ranked the 9th poorest in Wales on a Welsh Government (WG) index, reports North Wales Live.
But those that live, work and volunteer there say that while the figures do show the scale of deprivation on parts of the estate, they don't tell the terrible story how children are going hungry, with hundreds now relying on handouts.
According to figures published earlier in the year by the End Child Poverty campaign, Caia Park has the worst rates of child poverty in Wales, said county councillor for the Wynnstay ward on the estate, Malcolm King.
The estate has long had some of the most deprived ranked wards in Wales, where just 50 yards away across the road in Rhosnesni, life expectancy is seven years more, he said.
Parts of Caia Park are smart and tidy and don't fit a stereotypical picture people who have not visited the estate may have.  But walking on the streets around Queensway, past the empty Red Dragon pub, litter strewn across the car park and nearby boarded up properties, this is not an area a first world country should aspire to for its people.
Residents were understandably reluctant to talk to North Wales Live about the problems they faced, perhaps ashamed of the situation they've reluctantly found themselves locked into, while council chiefs insist they are supporting and developing the community.
Cllr King, a former Wrexham council leader who runs The Venture playscheme on the estate, said: "The most important figures are the child poverty figures released in April which show Caia Park was had the first and second worst areas in Wales. In fact three out of the top four were on the estate.
"There are no other housing estates in the UK where this happens, it has the largest concentration of child poverty anywhere."
Austerity has hit the estate hard, said Cllr King, with services cut and with the close of the anti-poverty Communities First scheme in Wrexham, The Venture has become a one-stop shop for families and people looking for advice and a range of issues from health to social services.
"It has been a steady decline," he said.
"Children are now coming to The Venture, not to play, but to get something to eat because they are starving.
"They are suffering from malnutrition and its unbelievable that's happening in a first world country and we know that children born into poor families are more likely to have health problems."
Cllr King says crime has not gone up to the levels it was at 40 years ago, but possibly to where it was 10 years previously.
Over at St Mark's Church, church army officer Chris Lawton told, although the church had suffered vandalism, there was a growing sense of community.
But he also told how children were going hungry and the church had launched a Holiday Hunger scheme to feed youngsters who don't have access to paid school dinners, when when they are off and can see 120 kids.
"It's very sad," he said. "We initially only had one or two families turning up at most to our food bank, now we can have 14-15 families."
Wrexham and Caia Park in particular, has had a major problem with car arson in recent years and on Bryn Eglwys outside the church, the charred remains of another burned out vehicle stained the road.
However local Brian Hyde says he feels safe in the area.
"That is the first incident I have seen on this road in 15 years," he said: "Everbody knows everybody else here and they look out for each other.
"Queensway does have its problems, but over here I do feel safe and it is quite quiet."
Working over at The Venture, community councillor Colin Powell said: "Not a lot has changed here in the last 15 years. It does feel as though the estate has been abandoned by Wrexham council.
"Wrexham is fairly affluent place but Caia Park is not getting the help it needs."
Cllr King added: "There are some positives in Caia Park, there is a community spirit, and there are a lot of hard working people, working ridiculous hours an low wages, in jobs that other people would not do.
"But it needs a large increase in funding to bring it back to where it was years ago and the council could be doing more and the council needs to do more."
In response Wrexham council released a comprehensive statement.
It said: "The council ran the Communities First operation in Caia Park and Hightown between 2013 and 2018, until the closure of the programme.
"The council has maintained a Communities for Work team based on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc since this time and this project, funded by European Social Fund is expected to continue to 2023 with funding of £1,977,350 confirmed.
"This employability support programme was expanded in 2018 with the addition of the WG’s Communities for Work Plus programme, which increased the number of participants eligible for employability support. As per the Communities for Work programme, Communities for Work Plus is delivered across two operations on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc, and is worth a total of £431,300.
"The Legacy Fund was launched for an initial period of 2018/19 to 2019/20, and the council has used this fund to provide andadditional officer to work in each of the Caia Park and Plas Madoc operations, as well as a training budget and barriers fund to further complement the Communities for Work teams, which totals £90,000.
"The project is based out of the Caia Park Partnership offices. Through this combination of employability support, more than 200 people have been supported into paid employment to date.
"The council also used the Legacy Fund to create and Employability Support Grant worth £146,447, which was available to previous providers of Communities First services. Applications for financial support were approved for the two  years of the fund from The Venture Playground Ltd. as lead for the Wrexham Youth & Play Partnership (which also includes Gwenfro Valley ICC) and the Caia Park Partnership.
"The council has supported the Caia Park Partnership to secure Asset Transfer arrangements and physical improvements to its buildings on Prince Charles Road, which has led to the creation of the Hwb element of the Partnership and also the extension of the Sparkles Day Nursery, which received funding through the Vibrant & Viable Places Programme.
"The council is currently supporting the assignment of the lease at the Red Dragon Public House, and planning permission is being sought for its conversion into a new, modern convenience store; and is currently working to support the granting of a lease to Wrexham Youth & Play Partnership for the Gwenfro Valley site.
"We have also used the Enabling Natural Resources and Well-being Grant, worth £477,035, for Wrexham’s Green Infrastructure Project, based three days per week in Caia Park.
"The council identified the Nant Silyn site in Pont Wen, Caia Park for new council house building, and a scheme of 14 units was approved by planning committee earlier this year.
"Gwenfro & Hafod y Wern Schools have been modernised / built as part of the 21 Century School programme with total investment of £10,285,000.
"The council has invested heavily, and continues to be committed to delivering and achieving the Welsh Housing Quality Standard by December 2020. Major investment and significant programmes of work have been ongoing since 2013, this includes large programmes of work in the Caia Park estate.
"Caia is the largest area where properties have, and continue, to receive major refurbishment works when empty, as well as new and efficient central heating systems, electrical rewires, and the recently commenced external works programme.
"In addition, the council’s Void Refurbishment Programme has seen investment of £5,220,000 in the Caia Park Estate in the last 12 months.
"The council has also facilitated repair works to the Venture Playground through Community Benefits approaches."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Swedish ambassador to China faces trial over Gui Minhai meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden's former ambassador to China faces an unprecedented trial over allegations she overstepped her authority during a meeting to secure the release of imprisoned bookseller Gui Minhai.
Anna Lindstedt, ambassador to Beijing from 2016 to early 2019, has been under investigation since February over a meeting she allegedly set up in Stockholm between Gui Minhai’s daughter and businessmen claiming to have connections to the Chinese Communist Party, without informing the Swedish foreign ministry.
Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen known for publishing gossipy titles about Chinese political leaders out of a Hong Kong book shop, disappeared while vacationing in Thailand in 2015 before resurfacing in mainland China.
The Swedish prosecution authority on Monday charged Lindstedt with "arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power", saying she had overstepped the boundaries of her authority during the meeting at which she had been "in contact with persons representing the interests of the Chinese State".
"An ambassador is the head of a public authority with a far-reaching mandate to represent Sweden; nonetheless, even ambassadors must adhere to certain guidelines and instructions issued by the Government Offices of Sweden and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In this specific consular matter, she has exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable," said prosecutor Hans Ihrman in a statement.
"A charge of arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power is unprecedented in modern times."
The Swedish foreign ministry has said it knew nothing about the meeting nor that the ambassador was even in Stockholm at the time. Lindstedt herself has denied the allegations a crime was committed.

Relations between Sweden and China have been strained for several years over the detention, over the detention of Gui Minhai, who disappeared from a vacation home in Thailand in 2015. Several months later he appeared on Chinese state television confessing to a fatal drunk driving accident from more than a decade earlier.
He served two years in prison, but three months after his October 2017 release he was again arrested while on a train to Beijing while travelling with Swedish diplomats. His supporters and family have claimed his detainment is part of political repression campaign orchestrated by Chinese authorities.
His daughter Angela Gui, who has been actively campaigning for her father's release, wrote in February on her blog that Lindstedt had invited her to Stockholm in January.
During discussions in the lounges of a fancy hotel in the Swedish capital, in the presence of the ambassador, she was introduced to Chinese businessmen who claimed they could help negotiate her father's release. In exchange, Angela Gui said she was told to "stop all media engagement".
The Chinese embassy in Stockholm said in a statement at the time that Beijing "has never authorized and will not authorize anyone to engage with Gui Minhai's daughter".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nativity Scene Shows Holy Family Separated, Caged at Border</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Claremont United Methodist Church has erected a Nativity scene portraying the Holy Family separated and held in cages at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The Rev. Karen Clark Ristine, senior minister at the church, posted a photo of the Nativity scene on Facebook, saying the depiction had stirred her “to tears.”
“In a time in our country when refugee families seek asylum at our borders and are unwillingly separated from one another, we consider the most well-known refugee family in the world,” Rev. Ristine wrote.
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, the Holy Family. Shortly after the birth of Jesus, Joseph and Mary were forced to flee with their young son from Nazareth to Egypt to escape King Herod, a tyrant. They feared persecution and death,” she said, calling this the “theological” interpretation of the scene.
The California minister went on to invite her readers to imagine Jesus, Mary, and Joseph as victims of present-day immigration policies.
“What if this family sought refuge in our country today?” she asked.
“Imagine Joseph and Mary separated at the border and Jesus no older than two taken from his mother and placed behind the fences of a Border Patrol detention center as more than 5,500 children have been the past three years,” she said.
“In the Claremont United Methodist Church nativity scene this Christmas, the Holy Family takes the place of the thousands of nameless families separated at our borders,” she said.
The provocative Facebook post elicited nearly 8,000 comments and 20,000 shares, split between supporters and critics.
Many of the comments took issue with the reverend’s politicization of the Christmas story, while also calling into question the intentions of the church in making this partisan statement.
“This is a good example of what it means to take the Name of God for your own vain and gain,” wrote one woman. “Claremont UMC are false teachers and false prophets. Claremont UMC is getting human trafficking money and funds in the guise of charity and are tax exempt while pushing false narratives and political agendas, and they profit at the expense of taxpayers, and they exploit the people they claim to help.”
The Rev. Ristine is not alone in comparing contemporary American politics to the rulers of the time of Jesus. Several days ago, Pope Francis compared President Donald Trump to King Herod, the ruler who massacred male infants in an effort to kill the baby Jesus, as recounted in Saint Matthew’s gospel.
Speaking with a Jesuit community during his recent visit to Thailand, the pope offered a thinly veiled condemnation of the U.S. president and his administration, suggesting that like King Herod, Mr. Trump separates families at the border while allowing drugs to freely flow into the country.
“In other parts there are walls that even separate children from parents. Herod comes to mind,” Francis said. “Yet for drugs, there’s no wall to keep them out.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KOTLAS, Russia -- Thousands have rallied in the northwestern Russian town of Kotlas against the construction of a new landfill for waste from Moscow.
One of the organizers of the rally, Vyacheslav Grigoryants, told RFE/RL that at least 3,000 men and women demonstrated in the town of 60,000 on December 8.
Other sources said more than 10,000 people attended the rally, where demonstrators demanded a halt to the ongoing construction of the dump in the town of Shiyes, near the regional capital, Arkhangelsk.
Authorities in Arkhangelsk have said that some 10.5 million tons of garbage are to be transferred to the new landfill from Moscow in the next 20 years.
The construction of the new landfill near Arkhangelsk started in July 2018. Protests against it began just a month later.
Similar rallies have been held in recent months in other Russian cities and towns.
In early February, nationwide rallies against landfills took place in 30 regions across Russia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Prosecutors Seek Lengthy Prison Terms For Two Former Bishkek Mayors </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BISHKEK -- Kyrgyz prosecutors in a high-profile corruption trial have asked a court to sentence two former mayors of Bishkek to lengthy prison terms.
The prosecutors asked the Lenin district court in Bishkek, on December 9, to sentence Albek Ibraimov to 20 years and Kubanychbek Kulmatov to 15 years in prison.
Kulmatov ran the capital city in 2014-16 and Ibraimov in 2016-18. The two were charged along with 11 others for alleged corruption while in office.
Both former officials served as mayors of Bishkek during the tenure of former President Almazbek Atambaev.
Three days earlier, two former Kyrgyz prime ministers, Sapar Isakov and Jantoro Satybaldiev, were sentenced to 15 and 7 1/2 years in prison in another high-profile corruption case.
That case was launched amid tensions between Atambaev and current incumbent Sooronbai Jeenbekov, an ex-prime minister who was tapped by Atambaev as his favored successor in Kyrgyzstan's October 2017 presidential election.
Atambaev was arrested on August 8 after he surrendered to police following two days of violent resistance by supporters. He had refused to show up at police headquarters for questioning in an unrelated case.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bosnia Puts Off Closing Makeshift Migrant Camp 'Until Further Notice'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bosnian authorities have indefinitely postponed the scheduled closing of a makeshift migrant tent camp in the northwest of the country.
The closing of the Vucjak camp had been scheduled for December 9, following harsh international criticism of the improper conditions hundreds of people are being housed in. The camp is hosting some 600 migrants, according to the Red Cross.
Rade Kovac, the director of the Bosnian Service for Foreigners' Affairs, visited the camp on December 9 and said that the authorities had postponed closing the camp until further notice.
Aid groups have repeatedly warned that the Vucjak camp is located on a former landfill and close to a mine field from Bosnia's 1992-95 war, and has no running water or toilets. Living conditions worsened further after snow started falling last week.
Kovac said the migrants will eventually be moved to one of the reception centers in the Sarajevo Canton. He gave no reason for the postponement, but media reports said the decision was prompted by a lack of proper accommodation at the reception centers.
Bosnia-Herzegovina's security minister, Dragan Mektic, last week announced that the occupants of the camp on the border with Croatia would be relocated to other camps outside the region.
"It was agreed that migrants would be moved early next week from this locality to other reception centers...and that this makeshift camp would be closed," Mektic said in a statement on December 6.
The decision to close the camp came after Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, visited Vucjak last week and warned that deaths would be imminent if the camp were not closed at once. "If we don't close the camp today, tomorrow people will start dying here," she told reporters while visiting the snow-covered camp.
On December 6, Mijatovic told a news conference in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, that it was now urgent to relocate the migrants and provide them with "decent accommodation."
"Many people lack adequate clothing and footwear,'' she said. "It is inhumane and unacceptable to keep people in such conditions.''
However, some migrants said that despite snow and freezing weather, they will refuse to be moved farther away from the border. Most of the migrants flocked to the northwestern part of Bosnia because they want to continue their journey to Western Europe's more prosperous countries by crossing the border into European Union member Croatia.
On December 7, migrants at Vucjak resumed accepting food distributed by the Bihac branch of the Red Cross, after refusing it for several days in protest at the announced relocation of the camp.
Bosnian authorities have struggled to accommodate thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Migrants enter Bosnia from neighboring Serbia or Montenegro.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka begin first Pakistan Test tour since 2009 attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Islamabad - Sri Lanka embarked on the first Test cricket tour of Pakistan in 10 years on Monday following the deadly 2009 attack on their team that plunged Pakistan into sporting isolation.
"Touchdown Islamabad," tweeted the Pakistan Cricket Board, along with video of the players at the airport, while Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Waseem Khan called their arrival a "historic occasion".
Sri Lanka will play two Tests under heavy security, one in Rawalpindi - where Pakistan's army is headquartered - and the second in Karachi, ending a decade-long absence for cricket's five-day format since the attack.
Eight people were killed and several players and officials were wounded when militants opened fire on a convoy of buses travelling to a Test in Lahore in March 2009.
"This is my first tour to Pakistan," said Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne, who opted out of the team's recent limited-overs tour of Pakistan.
"After the 2009 incidents players were scared to tour Pakistan but in the last two years or so Sri Lanka and other teams have toured Pakistan."
He added: "We want to play good cricket in Pakistan and hope they give us some good security."
The 2009 attack slammed the door shut on international sporting fixtures in cricket-loving Pakistan as foreign teams refused to visit over security fears.
Pakistan's cricket team has been forced to play its home matches on neutral ground in the United Arab Emirates, resulting in financial losses and hard times for Pakistani fans.
International cricket began making inroads back into the country when Zimbabwe became the first team to play in Pakistan in 2015, paving the wave for a smattering of Twenty20 matches ever since.
But Test matches - considered the pinnacle of international cricket - have until now remained absent. The first Test starts in Rawalpindi on Wednesday and the second is in Karachi from December 19.
"Pakistan's losses due to non-hosting of international cricket have been substantial," Waseem told AFP.
"Pakistan cricket supporters have been denied the opportunity to see their heroes play live in our national stadiums."
'Cricket in Pakistan is dying'
None of the players on Pakistan's current roster, including skipper Azhar Ali (75 Tests) and Asad Shafiq (71), has played a Test at home.
"I am happy Test cricket has finally return to Pakistan," said fan Ashfaq Ahmed, 48.
"Cricket in Pakistan is dying and our kids aren't as keen toward the game as we were once. But one can't blame the younger generations because they haven't seen their team playing in Pakistan."
The PCB are now hoping to turn things around thanks to a dramatic improvement in security in recent years, following a wave of crackdowns on militants across the country.
Sri Lanka, despite being the target of the 2009 attack, have been a driving force behind the return of international cricket after they played six limited-overs matches in Karachi and Lahore in September and October.
The return of international games and Pakistan Super League matches - as well as behind-the-scenes diplomacy - are finally paying dividends, according to Waseem.
"The eight (PSL) matches in Karachi earlier this year... were eye-openers for the 43 foreign cricketers who returned as our ambassadors," he said.
The series - the second for both teams in the ongoing World Test championship -- promises to be intriguing, not least because of the tussle between the two coaches: Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq and Sri Lanka's Mickey Arthur.
Arthur was Pakistan's coach until August when he was axed by the country's cricket officials, who included Misbah, following a disappointing performance at this year's World Cup.
The South African, who was only appointed by Sri Lanka last week, will hope to pile the pressure on Pakistan who are coming off a humiliating 2-0 Test thrashing in Australia which pushed them down to eighth in the rankings.
Misbah, who is also Pakistan's chief selector and batting coach, will be under especially heavy scrutiny following Pakistan's run of poor form.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fear over future of disabled people's day centre</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A project for 78 young adults with special needs who have nowhere else to go is being split up and mums are angry.
The award-winning ROC Creative project at Palace Avenue in Paignton runs five days a week and parents have been told it is being moved and split into four smaller groups on January 31.
The young adults all have mild to severe learning difficulties, many have educational disabilities and further physical disabilities including Downs syndrome and autism. They study drama, dance, photography and art.
Many have attended on a  daily basis ever since ROC Creative started 10 years ago. Now parents have learned it is about to be moved - some to cob barns in Cockington and some to Totnes.
In 2016 ROC (formerly Robert Owen Communities) merged with United Response and parents claim "everything has changed".
Mums Jill Holmes (who son, aged 22, has been part of the group for over two years) and Colette Phillips (whose daughter is 30 and has been attending since it started) say the new location at Cockington is not suitable and they are angry that parents were not informed.
Jill said: "We can't keep quiet about this - it's our children's lives. Most of them will never be able to work. This is all they have and there is nowhere else they can go.
"We went to have a look at the cob barn which is near the shops at Cockington. Apart from the fact that Cockington is beautiful, everything else is unsuitable - there's no transport, it's freezing cold in winter and in summer they will have to leave the doors open and our young people will be an exhibit.
"At the moment they are in the middle of Paignton. They can walk to the Co-op. There are buses. This old barn is completely wrong. It's just about cost.
"They are not thinking about the people they are supposed to be supporting."
Colette said: "My daughter has been there for 10 years - it's amazing the atmosphere and special relationships between them all as a group. My daughter completely came out of herself after joining ROC Creative.
"Now we have just found out this week that they are going to be split up. It will be devastating for them to have to deal with. It will be hard on us as parents as well.
"They are not all young adults - the eldest person in the group is 55. That means a lot of the parents are elderly and they cannot take their children out and about. Some live in supported living and they have nowhere else to go. There are no other opportunities for them.
Jill said: "ROC Creative has been out of this world for all different disabilities - it has changed my son's life.
"We have known that United Response has been looking at the current building for the last nine months because of maintenance issues."
Mike Crowhurst, Divisional Director for United Response, said:
"Our ROC Creative project is committed to truly inclusive art and has a track record of delivering bespoke activities which inspire creativity and independence among the local learning disability community.
"We do not own the space at The Palace Theatre and increased running costs enforced by the council have ultimately forced us to consider alternative nearby venues.
"The current space has no disabled access - distinctly limiting those who can attend - whilst there have also been other problems with heating and hot water supply, toilets and parking.
"We recognise that news of a potential move may come as a surprise to those who attend, and we have not wanted to alarm anyone unnecessarily if changes were not needed. This meant not speaking publicly until we had understood our options.
"We now want to assure everyone that we are doing everything we can to preserve the future of a project about which we’re deeply passionate.
"We will update staff, participants and families on the future of ROC Creative as soon as we can. Whilst nothing has yet been agreed, we’re excited about its future and want as many people as possible to be part of it."
Parents have been told they will be invited to consultation meetings in Totnes later in December.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Police latest after woman injured by double decker bus in Torquay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision between a woman and a bus in Torquay which left the 26-year-old with serious injuries.
It happened at around 9.30pm on Saturday, December 7. Emergency services were called to reports of a collision between a Stagecoach bus and a single female pedestrian.
Police say the 26-year-old local woman suffered considerable lower leg injuries and was taken to Derriford Hospital for treatment.
It is believed she is local to the area and had been out for a meal before making her way to work nearby.
No other parties were injured in the collision.
Eyewitness Pete Vernon, who called 999, said the whole thing happened in “two or three seconds”.
He said: “The girl in question is about 21 years old. Was coming out of Revolution and as she did her friend said something and she turned. The bus was passing as she turned. She hit her head on the side of the bus and as she fell her legs went under the wheels. There was nothing the driver could have done. It wasn’t his or her fault because the front of the vehicle had long passed although the whole thing happened in two or three seconds.
“I called 999 and had to give a statement. It was just a very unfortunate accident. My thoughts are with the girl’s family.”
Another eyewitness who gave a police statement saw the crash happened. He said: “As she came out of Revolution she was looking the opposite way and the bus hit her face and then went over her legs.
The road was closed for a short time whilst emergency services dealt with the injured party and the scene.
Devon and Cornwall Police say: "The police would like to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity and witnessed the collision or may have dash cam footage of the incident or event leading up to it. 
"Anyone who witnessed the incident and anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting log 887 7/12/19."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Exeter's fondly remembered 'celebrity' hairdresser passes away in husband's arms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tributes have been paid to a well-known hair salon owner who has passed away after battling with ill health.
Lavinia Cook was the proprietor of not one but five salons in and around Exeter before leaving Devon in 2004 and moving up north.
She had three in St Thomas and two on the outskirts of Exeter, as well as seven mobile hairdressing vans for home clients.
Such was her talent that she was asked by Ford Motors to design a hairstyle – The Capri – to coincide with the launch of the Ford Capri in 1969.
It gained her much acclaim, as well as reluctant local celebrity status, and the name Lavinia Hair Fashions was known far and wide.
Her father Wilfred, a notable trilby-wearing figure and much-loved businessman at this time, was her business partner and chief promoter, who wouldn’t let her talents go unnoticed.
Lavinia, nee Hulland, was born in Exeter and met her husband Barry, who owned Nitty Gritty Now, in Exeter 52 years ago and they were married for 48 years. Together they had a child, Petena-Marie, and become grandparents to three grandchildren, Reece, James and Kyle.
They moved to the north west in 2004 and had many happy years there, but she struggled with her health, although was always a challenge to her GP because she would said she was ‘fine’ whenever asked how she was.
Lavinia had a life-saving operation in 2011, but told very little more than her family needed to know because she did not want to distress them.
Barry said: “As she was a trooper in spirit through illness she did not want anyone to suffer because she was.
“Lavinia was greatly loved and admired by all, and was often told, ‘don’t ever change’. She was at the very heart of my life. Losing my beautiful lady too soon has fractured my world.
“She will be painfully missed."
Lavinia passed away in Barry’s arms on October 3.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Presidential Symphony Orchestra to perform in new Ankara building next year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Architects working on Turkey's Presidential Symphony Orchestra building in the capital Ankara told Anadolu Agency (AA) that the new facility will be completed by the end of the next year, with artistic, social and civic features.
Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy announced that the construction of the concert hall will be finished within a year, 28 years after it began. The new facility will have two halls with a capacity of 2,500 people, a backstage and a VIP lounge.
Architect couple Semra Uygur and Özcan Uygur said such public facilities provide prestige to a city and reflect the image of a country. "Having a stranger watch a concert there changes the image of the country," Özcan Uygur said. Semra Uygur added that the concert hall will contribute to the cultural and artistic life of society and strengthen the social communication of people. "The Presidential Symphony Orchestra is the only institution bearing the name of Turkey's presidency. This facility will play an important role in the cultural life of Ankara and Turkey," she said.
Architectural features
In 1992, a national architectural project to build a concert hall in the area of the Atatürk Culture Center was launched. "The project was built in a timeless style that contributes to the cityscape and stands out for its design that will be appreciated for years to come," Semra Uygur said of the jury's final decision on the project.
She said the area is located between the mausoleum of Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and the Ankara Castle."We had the chance to locate the main concept of the structure emotionally and physically in relation to the urban area. A structure that does not harmonize with its surroundings is meaningless," she added.
The Presidential Symphony Orchestra's new structure is egg-shaped, combined with a pyramid-shaped building. "We combined the wall and roof to create the feeling that it is surrounded by the environment; therefore, the structure consists of singular and independent forms," Semra Uygur stated.
Özcan Uygur said the egg-shaped form also boosts the acoustics inside the structure."Only symphonic music can be performed here," Semra Uygur said, noting that it is the first hall built solely for concert purposes in Turkey.
However, visitors to the building will do more than just listen to music, Özcan Uygur stressed. "People will come to socialize, meet new people and come together," he said. "When the construction of this facility is over, it will be a place where people can take a break. Public facilities not only serve their visitors but also the community."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey tackles power supply problems in liberated areas of N Syria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Turkey is dealing with a power supply problem in a recently liberated area in northern Syria after the PKK-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) were forced out in a Turkish anti-terror operation, the Defense Ministry said Sunday.
Having largely cleared YPG elements from northern Syrian territories, the Turkish army has accelerated efforts to ensure stability in the region by meeting the basic needs of war-weary locals, including in rural areas of Tal Abyad.
According to a ministry statement, progress is being made to solve power-related problems. "Repairs began on Nov. 22 on the Mabruka Electricity Transformer Station, which feeds the south of the M4 highway and the Operation Peace Spring area," said the statement.
"Following the repairs, the provision of electricity from the Tishrin Dam to the Operation Peace Spring area was established through meetings with Russian military officials in Ayn Isa. In this respect, electricity was provided to the Tal Abyad countryside. Work is also ongoing to provide electricity to Tal Abyad center and the Ras al-Ayn region."
The area's water supply problems have also been largely solved. The Allouk Water Reservoir that feeds Ras al-Ayn, Darbasiyah and Hasakah, was fully restored and measures were taken to ensure it is at its full operational capacity, said the ministry.
Turkey on Oct. 9 launched Operation Peace Spring to eliminate YPG terrorists from northern Syria and east of the Euphrates, in order to secure Turkey's borders, aid the safe return of Syrian refugees and ensure Syria's territorial integrity.
Under two separate deals with the U.S. and Russia, Turkey temporarily halted the operation to allow the withdrawal of YPG terrorists from the planned northern Syria safe zone.
Ankara wants the YPG terrorists to withdraw so a safe zone can be created to allow for the return of some 2 million Syrian refugees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia ends gender-segregated entrances for restaurants</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Restaurants and cafes in Saudi Arabia are no longer required to have gender-segregated entrances, officials said, in a further easing of social restrictions in the kingdom.
Eateries have long required one entrance for single men and another for women and families, in a country where the once-powerful religious police zealously enforced sex segregation in public places for decades.
The ministry of municipalities and rural affairs said on Twitter Sunday it was eliminating several requirements for restaurants, including the need for "an entrance for bachelors and a separate entrance for families."
It was unclear whether a restriction on seating inside restaurants will also be removed. The decision applies also to cafes, entertainment centers and wedding venues, according to the statement.
Restaurants are currently segregated into a "family" section for those accompanied by women and a "singles" area for men, though many have quietly taken down the barriers in recent years amid the kingdom's sweeping liberalization drive.
The latest reform was hailed by young Saudis but dismissed by arch-conservatives on social media, with one Twitter user saying it went "against sharia," or Islamic law.
Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has sought to project a moderate, business-friendly image of his austere kingdom as he seeks to boost investment.
Prince Mohammed has clipped the powers of hardline clerics as he pursues a modernization drive that has allowed mixed-gender music concerts and ended decades-long bans on cinemas and women drivers.
The oil-rich kingdom has recently seen a shift from the country's strict guardianship system as well, which requires women to obtain consent from a male relative for major decisions. Women are now allowed to rent a hotel room, get a passport and travel outside the kingdom without the approval of a male guardian.
Until three years ago, the religious police elicited widespread fear in the kingdom, chasing men and women out of malls to pray and berating anyone seen mingling with the opposite sex.
The hardline enforcers of public morality, whose powers began waning even before Prince Mohammed rose to power, are now largely out of sight.
But the reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on activists, including women urging faster reform, some of whom have accused interrogators of sexual harassment and torture. Saudi prosecutors deny the accusations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finland's Marin to become world's youngest prime minister at 34</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Finland's Social Democrats elected Sunday a 34-year-old former transport minister to the post of the prime minister, making her the youngest head of government in the world's history.
Sanna Marin narrowly won Sunday's vote to replace outgoing leader Antti Rinne, who resigned Tuesday after losing the confidence of the coalition partner Centre Party over his handling of a postal strike.
"We have a lot of work to do to rebuild trust," Marin told reporters on Sunday night while deflecting questions about her age.
"I have never thought about my age or gender, I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate."
At 34, Marin also becomes one of the world's youngest state leaders, ahead of Ukraine's prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who is currently 35.
Former PM Antti Rinne had headed Finland's center-left five-party coalition since June, and Marin's appointment is unlikely to lead to significant policy changes by the Social Democrat-led administration.
"We have a shared government program which we have committed to," Marin said.
The SDP won April's legislative elections on promises to end years of economic belt-tightening introduced by the Center Party to lift Finland out of a recession.
Rinne stepped down after several weeks of political crisis over a plan to cut wages for 700 postal workers.
Finland's postal service withdrew the reform plans in November after widespread strikes, but questions emerged over whether or not Rinne had previously endorsed the cutbacks, leading to the Center Party declaring it had lost its trust in the prime minister last Monday.
Parliament is expected to formally swear in the new prime minister on Tuesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey alone on Palestine but will keep supporting oppressed, Erdoğan says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Turkey generally feels alone regarding the situation in Jerusalem and Palestine, but will not stop defending the cause, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowed Monday.
"The situation in Palestine and Jerusalem is deteriorating and some Arab countries are encouraging Israeli violations. I feel like Turkey is alone on this, but we will continue to stand with the oppressed," Erdoğan told a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul.Recalling that the Jerusalem case laid the foundation of the OIC, Erdogan said that the situation in Jerusalem and Palestine is getting worse every day.He noted that Israel's attitude, which does not recognize rights, law, justice and humanity, constantly deepens the crisis in the region against Muslims."We are aware that one of the reasons behind the terrorist attacks and economic sabotages we have been subjected to in recent years is our principled stance," he said, adding that Turkey will continue to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and never stop defending the rights of the Palestinians.Israel occupied east Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. In 1980, in a move never recognized by the international community, Israel annexed the entire city, claiming it as the self-proclaimed Jewish state's "eternal and undivided" capital.Erdoğan also underlined that the imperialist approach of divide, disintegrate and rule continues in Islamic countries saying: "Muslims, who make up about one-fourth of the world's population today, do not have, unfortunately, the political influence or the economic, social or cultural prowess.”
"The better we protect children, women, elderly and disabled against western threats, the more we protect our family structure," he said.The Turkish president added that "isolated" Islamic countries are wasting their opportunities and energies.
Erdoğan stressed that it was impossible to get somewhere by simply complaining or talking, arguing for the pressing need to think carefully, analyze and produce solutions to the causes of oppression felt by Muslims today.
"It is our responsibility, as Muslims, to take Islamic civilization to its rightful place," he said.
He noted that in 2018, Turkey was added to the "very high" development category for the first time, posting 0.806 value points on the human development index (HDI).Turkey ranked 59th out of 189 countries and territories, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said in a report released Monday.The HDI is a summary measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living.Erdoğan later spoke at the Eighth Ministerial Conference of Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process at Dolmabahçe Palace under the theme of "peace, partnership, prosperity."In his speech, Erdoğan called on the international community to boost the investments made for Afghanistan in the last 18 years as the country has been going through a sensitive period.His speech focused on "regional cooperation" to tackle problems the South Asia region has been facing."I believe that the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process is also very useful and effective in providing regional support for peace," he said.Erdoğan said while the international community was committed to its pledges to Afghanistan, it was important that the Afghan government fulfills its obligations.
"We welcome the positive steps taken by the Afghan government in the implementation of the Mutual Accountability Framework adopted in Geneva last year," Erdoğan said.He added that Turkey would do its best to eradicate the Daesh terrorist group's presence in Afghanistan.The Heart of the Asia-Istanbul Process – a regional initiative of Afghanistan and Turkey launched in 2011 – has two chairs, with Afghanistan as the permanent chair, as well as a co-chair from among member states shifting each year.
"The process aims to promote regional security, economic and political cooperation centered on Afghanistan through dialogue and confidence-building measures," according to the organization's website.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least two soldiers were killed and seven more injured in a PKK bomb explosion in southeastern Turkey on Monday.
According to the governorate, an improvised explosive device (IED) planted by PKK terrorists exploded during disposal efforts in southeastern Şırnak province.
Security forces launched an investigation into the deadly explosion.
In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU – has been responsible for the deaths of some 40,000 people, including women and children.
In addition to killing women and children in terror attacks, PKK ringleaders are known to sexually abuse and rape women and children who they trick into coming to their training camps.
International organizations, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, have also repeatedly documented the PKK and its Syrian affiliate, the People's Protection Units (YPG), kidnapping and forcing hundreds of children to fight in their ranks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Met Office warns of power cuts when high winds hit Derbyshire</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for heavy winds in Derbyshire, meaning power cuts are possible.
People across the county have been told to expect delays to road, rail and air transport are likely as a result of winds that may reach up to 60mph.
Bus and train services are expected to be affected, with some journeys taking longer and being made worse by spray and surface water.
High sided vehicles like buses and lorries may have issues travelling on exposed routes and bridges.
The warning is in place until lunchtime today, Monday, December 9.
Met Office officials have also said "short term loss of power and other services is possible".
They say on their website: "Gusts of wind can unsettle vehicles, grip your steering wheel firmly with both hands. This is particularly important when planning to overtake.
"Keep an eye out for gaps between trees, buildings or bridges over a river or railway, these are some of the places you are more likely to be exposed to side winds.
"Ensure that you maintain enough room either side of your vehicle so you can account for it being blown sideways."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CLEARWATER, Fla. — Some kids in Pinellas County are hoping to inspire other kids their age.
The Clearwater High School Civil Rights Ambassadors are visiting other Pinellas County high schools inviting other students to participate in an upcoming unity walk.
The students gave a short civil rights lesson to other students and invited them to participate.
They're spreading a message of history, hope and inclusion.
PINELLAS NEWS | The latest headlines from Pinellas County
"After what has happened in this nation and in this school district, are we unified? So, we decided to put together this unity walk to unify all of us because at the end of the day we are a district united," says Kayla Bredeson.
This is the first year Pinellas County Schools will participate in the Unity Walk.
The Unity Walk will be on January 28, 2020. Their goal will be for 30 students from each school to attend.
Lynda Blackmon Lowery will be the guest speaker. She's the youngest person who walked across the Edmond Pettis Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. She was 14 years old.
The Civil Rights Ambassador program is a class at Clearwater High School. The students research and participate in experiences that connect them to the impact of the Civil Rights Movement. They also volunteer in various programs to make a positive impact in the community.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The whitest boy on the beach, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, has decided to bring his beach-grabbing exploits to the attention of everyone.
Of course, that's not what Huckabee actually wanted to do. He wanted his privatizing of the area where water meets land to remain as unnoticed as he wishes his front yard was. But if we've learned anything at all over the years, it's that the more you try to stop people from talking about your beachfront property, the less likely it is that you'll get them to stop talking about it.
Huckabee's $6 million mansion in the Florida panhandle proves money can't buy quite as much happiness as it used to. Huckabee thought he had purchased a chunk of beach to go with his beach house. Florida beachgoers felt otherwise. They used "his" beach like they used the beach anywhere else along the coast.
Andy Marlette of the Pensacola News Journal has compiled a few choice quotes from Huckabee regarding the disrespecting of his $6 million beachfront property.
Fun stuff. Huckabee says he bought the beach along with the house. Governor Rick Scott agreed, passing a law that privatized a bunch of previously-public land in 2018. (It was sort of walked back a few months later.)  A bunch of Floridians disagree and have been working to codify public access to beaches panhandle millionaires believe they own. Attorney Daniel Uhlfelder has been leading the charge, doing pro bono work for non-profit "Florida Beaches for All."
Uhlfelder has also been taking a few Twitter jabs at Mike Huckabee, much to the former governor's dismay. Here's Steve Bousquet's summation of recent events, which have culminated in a very stupid move by the $6 million man.
Yes, Huckabee has filed a bar complaint in hopes of shutting down this persistent critic -- one who suggested Huckabee's Secret Service nickname should be "beach thief." The complaint [PDF] is quite the read, with Huckabee (through legal representation) explaining just how awful (and allegedly unethical) it is to be mocked on social media.
Whew. OK then. The complaint contains numerous screenshots from Uhlfelder's Twitter account doing things like calling Huckabee out for blocking him. It also contains tweets noting that Huckabee has called Uhlfelder an "ambulance chaser" and suggested the lawyer "follow Jesus" rather than Huckabee. (On Twitter, I guess…)
What it doesn't show is anything Uhlfelder should be reprimanded for. Sure, Uhlfelder could be a bit more tactful when interacting with litigation opponents on social media, but the Florida Bar rules don't specifically prohibit this sort of behavior. Lawyers aren't allowed to "disparage" or "humiliate" opposing litigants, but it would be a stretch to call Uhlfelder's mostly-innocuous tweaking of the easily-offended Huckabee a violation of this rule.
What Huckabee has managed to do is draw more attention to both his own questionable actions and the movement targeting the law that turned public beaches into private yards last year. Uhlfelder had fewer than 500 Twitter followers prior to Huckabee's complaint. Now, he has over 70,000.
Huckabee tried to silence a critic by handing him a bigger megaphone. If Huckabee's skin had just been a little thicker, this could have been contained to the tiny part of Twitter that cares about the dynamics of Florida beachfront legislation. Instead, it's now all about Huckabee and his inability to handle criticism. Huckabee now has thousands of new critics, almost none of whom can be hit with a bar complaint.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The total number of confirmed victims of a massive fire that broke out in Odesa's Economics, Law and Hospitality College on December 4 has grown to 12.
"Another two bodies were found under the rubble as of 07:15 on Monday, December 9," says the Odesa Region Police Department.
"The bodies are yet to be identified. Four people are still missing," it said.
As UNIAN reported earlier, a fire broke out on the third floor of a six-story education block of Odesa's Economics, Law and Hospitality College on the morning of December 4. The area of the fire covered 4,000 square meters. The block housed 19 different organizations and establishments.
As of the morning of December 8, ten people, including a rescuer, were declared dead. Thirty people were injured, of them, nine are still in hospital.
Criminal proceedings were initiated under Part 2 of Article 270 (violation of fire safety rules) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The police are considering two theories: the use of malfunctioning electrical equipment and an arson attack.

"We don't divide the world into either foes or friends," said the NATO secretary general, when pressed to define Russia.
Stoltenberg added that in an "uncertain" moment like this, such a strong institute as NATO is required to ensure security of the West.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kentucky law requiring abortion seekers to listen to fetal heartbeat will stand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a challenge to a Kentucky law requiring doctors to describe ultrasound images and play fetal heartbeat sound to abortion seekers.
Kentucky argued the law is "simple and straightforward," calling it part of an" informed-consent process." The law, Kentucky said, "does nothing more than require that women who are considering an abortion be provided with information that is truthful, non-misleading and relevant to their decision of whether to have an abortion."
The court rejected the case without comment or noted dissent by any of the justices.
Challengers, including an abortion clinic, argued that the law forced patients to see the images even if she didn't want to, and that it violated doctors' First Amendment rights.
The law had been upheld by the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, but that ruling was on hold pending the Supreme Court appeal.
"As a First Amendment matter, there is nothing suspect with a State's requiring a doctor, before performing an abortion, to make truthful, non-misleading factual disclosures, relevant to informed consent, even if those disclosures relate to unborn life and have the effect of persuading the patient not to have an abortion," the appeals court held in its ruling.
Civil rights groups blasted the court's decision not to take up the challenge.
"By refusing to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, the Supreme Court has rubber-stamped extreme political interference in the doctor-patient relationship," said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. "This law is not only unconstitutional, but as leading medical experts and ethicists explained, deeply unethical."
The Kentucky denial comes as the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion in the US is facing multiple challenges in lower courts.
"Although this case is abortion-related, the plaintiffs' challenge was that the law violated the free speech rights of the doctors, as opposed to the abortion rights of the patients," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
"In that regard, although many find the Kentucky law offensive, it doesn't implicate the same fundamental questions about the continuing scope of the right to choose that the justices identified in Roe as other cases already on the court's docket this term and coming down the pipeline," Vladeck added.
Later this term, the justices are set to consider a separate Louisiana law that requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges from a nearby hospital. The justices in 2016 struck down a similar law from Texas, which had led to clinic closures. The court majority said the law put an unconstitutional burden on women seeking abortion.
It will be the first abortion case that will be argued since Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch joined the bench, solidifying a conservative majority.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2 4-year-olds escape deadly crash by unhooking seats, climbing to safety</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WHIDBEY ISLAND, Wash. – Two young girls are alive after they managed to unhook themselves from their booster seats and climb to safety to escape an accident on Whidbey Island, according to the Washington State Patrol.
The girls, both 4 years old, were riding with Corey Simmons, 47, when the vehicle crashed into some trees in a wooded area about 200 feet away from the road, said Trooper Heather Axtman, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Patrol.
The accident happened around 6 p.m. Friday just outside of Clinton, Washington, about an hour from Seattle.
According to Axtman, Simmons was not wearing a seat belt and was likely killed on impact. The girls, who were riding in the back of the car when the accident happened, were able to release themselves from their booster seats, crawl out of the car and find their way through a wooded area and up a small embankment to the side of the road, Axtman said.
A woman driving by noticed the girls standing on the side of the road and stopped to help them. Describing the area as very rural, Axtman said the chances that anyone would drive by and see these girls "was truly the right time at the right place" type of thing.
The Good Samaritan put the girls in her car to keep them warm and called 911.
Police and fire responded to the scene, where Simmons was pronounced dead. The 4-year-olds were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries where they were reunited with their family, Axtman said.
"The bravery that these two little girls showed was incredible," she said. Highlighting how they were so young, but were able to find their way from the crash in the cold and dark, Axtman called them "extremely heroic and brave."
Authorities are not releasing the names of the girls involved because they are minors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FBI now treating investigation into Pensacola naval station shooting as an 'act of terror'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The motive behind a 21-year-old gunman's attack on Naval Air Station Pensacola remains undetermined, but the FBI is treating it as "an act of terror," a member of the agency said.
Working under the "presumption that this was an act of terrorism" will allow agents to take advantage of certain investigative techniques, FBI Special Agent in Charge Rachel Rojas said.
Mohammed Alshamrani, a Saudi Arabian Air Force officer who had been in flight training at the base for two years, opened fire in a classroom building on Friday, killing three sailors who ran toward danger to protect others, officials said. Several others were injured.
The shooter used a handgun and was killed after two deputies exchanged gunfire with him.
The deadlyshooting "appears to be a terrorist attack," White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said. Authorities haven't found ties between the attacker and terrorist groups.
"We don't know yet if he was acting alone," O'Brien said on CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday. "The FBI is investigating, and they've been interviewing, interrogating other Saudi students."
The victims were Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida; Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia; and Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, from Enterprise, Alabama.
"If not for their actions, and the actions of the Naval Security Force that were the first responders on the scene, this incident could have been far worse," said Capt. Tim Kinsella, the commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola.
Several other Saudi nationals were questioned
Alshamrani was stationed at the base as part of an ongoing US military program training members of foreign militaries, including Saudi Arabia's.
US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Department of Defense will look at the measures currently in place to insure proper vetting and screening of foreign students. Still, he said, the shooting likely wouldn't impact the US-Saudi alliance.
"I don't see this undermining the deeper relationship we've had with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for decades," he said.
Over the weekend, several Saudi nationals were detained for questioning in connection to the attack, a US official told CNN. The officialdidn't provide information on their connection to the gunman.
Alshamrani and a small group of Saudi nationals traveled to New York City over the Thanksgiving holiday, a law enforcement official told CNN. They visited several museums and Rockefeller Center, the source said, but authorities don't know why they traveled to the city. The Saudis who accompanied Alshamrani are currently being interviewed by law enforcement and are being cooperative, the source added.
At least one Saudi national also filmed the shooting, Esper said.
On Sunday, the FBI said it was reviewing surveillance videos and a video taken by a bystander after the attack. A senior law enforcement official told CNN that one Saudi national who recorded the aftermath was considered a bystander, adding investigators didn't believe this person was involved in the attack and was far away from the scene when he captured the emergency response after the incident.
Friends of the gunman were detained after the killing, one or two of which recorded the attack, Esper said. It was unclear when they began filming, Esper told "Fox News Sunday."
A separate law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation says there is currently no indication of anything nefarious regarding any individual who recorded the attack scene.
The official says all witnesses to the incident are being interviewed.
Twitter account may have been linked to shooter
Minutes before authorities were alerted to the attack, a Twitter account aligning with the shooter's name posted a message that raises the possibility the attack was inspired by al Qaeda and its founder, Osama bin Laden, CNN's Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank wrote.
The message, addressed to the American people, declared hate for Americans because of their "crimes" against Muslims. It made no reference to an impending attack. Instead, it repurposed words used by bin Laden and the American al Qaeda terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.
CNN has been unable to verify the source of the tweet which was previously reported on by SITE Intelligence Group. Law enforcement has not commented on it.
A Twitter spokeswoman says the account was suspended, adding "That's all we have to share."
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantissaid in a Sunday news conference the shooter had "a major social media trail."
"This guy was somebody who had just a deep-seeded hatred for the United States and that was pretty clear from that," he said.
"For us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions to protect the country."
Foreign students from "partner nations" have trained at the base for years, Kinsella said.
The shooter was vetted before his entry into the pilot training program and after the shooting with nothing of concern found, a law enforcement source told CNN. But DeSantis said Sunday the shooting could have been prevented if there was "better vetting."
He bought his weapon using a hunting license
The shooter had bought the gun he used in the attack legally, two law enforcement officials told CNN.
One source said Alshamrani purchased the weapon from a gun store earlier this year using a hunting license, which allows a non-immigrant on a non-immigrant visa to purchase a gun.
Alshamrani used a Glock 9 mm pistol he bought "legally and lawfully," Rojas told reporters.
Alshamrani's uncle said his nephew had done "nothing suspicious" before moving to the US.
Saad bin Hantim Alshamrani said his nephew was "likable and mannered towards his family and the community." Alshamrani said he "has his religion, his prayer, his honesty and commitments" and that he was a "likable kid, smart, he was exceptionally smart."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- Police have issued a Citizen Commendable Action Coin to a Cape Coral man who helped rescue an elderly woman from a canal last month.
According to Cape Coral Police, on November 27th, Jeffrey Jennings saw an unknown elderly woman in the waters of the canal behind his home. He called 911 to summon police and medical personnel, then rode his bicycle to the home she appeared to be near on the opposite canal bank.
Jennings guided officers to the correct location, then jumped into the water to get the woman to safety.
The woman was assessed by medical staff and determined to be suffering from confusion and the early stages of hypothermia. Thanks to the actions of Jennings, she did not suffer any lasting effects.
Officers Ken Cody and William Dotson recommended Jennings be issued the Citizen Commendable Action Coin for his actions and assistance in helping the woman, and presented him with the award on December 2nd.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Zealand volcano erupts: 5 dead, many missing after eruption on White Island, officials say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WHITE ISLAND, New Zealand - At least five people are dead after a volcano erupted Monday on New Zealand’s White Island, officials said.
According to New Zealand police, 50 or fewer people, including more than 30 passengers on Royal Caribbean International’s Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, were in the area when the volcano erupted just after 2 p.m. local time Monday, CNN reported. Of the 23 people evacuated, five have died, and many of the 18 survivors were being treated for burn wounds, The Associated Press reported.
In a Monday night news conference, New Zealand police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said he was not sure how many people remain on the island but estimated that it was a double-digit number, the AP reported. Rescuers are not yet able to search the island because “the physical environment is unsafe,” Tims said.
Police have not released the nationalities or identities of the victims and the missing; however, the Guardian reported that at least 20 are Australian. Officials also believe that “overseas tourists” and New Zealand residents were affected, according to the AP.
Royal Caribbean issued a statement saying it is “devastated” by the eruption and offering sympathy to “those affected by this tragedy,” CNN reported.
“We are working together with local authorities, and we are providing all the help and care we can to our guests and their families, including offering medical resources and counseling,” the statement read. “We are also sending staff members from both our ship and our Sydney and Auckland offices to assist family members however possible.”
The cruise line added that the “Ovation of the Seas will remain in port as long as needed to assist with the situation,” according to CNN.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Blue and White and the Likud would both gain seats if new elections were held today, a new poll shows.
According to a survey conducted by Kantar and released by Kan Monday morning, if new elections were held today, Blue and White and the Likud would each gain two seats, rising from 33 for the center-left Blue and White to 35, while the Likud would rise from 32 to 34 seats.
The left-wing and right-wing blocs would also remain largely unchanged, with the left-Arab bloc holding steady at 57 seats, while the right-wing – religious bloc would rise from its current 55 seats to 56 seats. The secular rightist Yisrael Beytenu, which broke away from the right-wing bloc to demand a national unity government, would receive seven seats, down from its current eight.
The two haredi parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, would receive eight seats each, a gain of one for UTJ, which currently has seven, and a loss of one for Shas, which won nine in the September election.
The New Right party of Defense Minister Naftali Bennett would double its current strength of three seats, winning six, while the Jewish Home – National Union would fail to cross the electoral threshold, leaving it out of the next Knesset. In September, the Jewish Home, National Union, and New Right ran jointly on the Yamina list, winning seven seats – three of which went to the New Right, with the other four divided evenly between the National Union and the Jewish Home.
On the Left, Labor-Gesher and the Democratic Union would each fall by one seat, down to five and four seats respectively.
The Joint Arab List would remain stable at 13 seats.
Voters remain nearly evenly divided on who they prefer as prime minister, with 41% favoring incumbent premier Binyamin Netanyahu, compared to 38% who prefer challenger Benny Gantz of Blue and White.
The poll was conducted Sunday by Kantar, and included responses from 556 participants.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Old man' Trump is 'bluffing' says North Korea: KCNA</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">North Korea on Monday accused US President Trump of "bluffing" and called him "an old man bereft of patience" as Pyongyang ramps up pressure on Washington over stalled nuclear talks.
Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un engaged in mutual insults and threats of devastation in 2017, sending tensions soaring before a diplomatic rapprochement the following year.
Pyongyang has now set Washington an end-of-year deadline to offer it new concessions in deadlocked nuclear negotiations, and has said it will adopt an unspecified "new way" if nothing acceptable is forthcoming.
Denuclearisation negotiations have been at a standstill since a summit in Hanoi broke up in February.
Trump has indicated that the option of military action was still on the table while downplaying Pyongyang's actions, saying the North's leader would not want to "interfere" with the upcoming US presidential elections.
"I'd be surprised if North Korea acted hostiley," Trump said Saturday.
But Kim Yong Chol, who served as the North's counterpart to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until the collapse of the Hanoi meeting, condemned Trump's "odd words and expression", referring to him as a "heedless and erratic old man".
If Trump is not "astonished" by North Korea's response, "we will be irritated," Kim, now the chairman of the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.
"This naturally indicates that Trump is an old man bereft of patience," he said, adding: "From those words and expressions we can read how irritated he is now."
The official noted that the North Korean leader had not used "any irritating expression towards the US president as yet", but warned his "understanding" of Trump could change.
"He must understand that his own style bluffing and hypocrisy sound rather abnormal and unrealistic to us," Kim said. "We have nothing more to lose."
Late Monday another North Korean official, Ri Su Yong, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, warned Trump against using abusive language.
In another statement carried by KCNA, he said the US president should "think twice if he does not want to see bigger catastrophic consequences."
The North has raised tensions in recent months with a series of assertive statements and multiple weapons tests -- including a "very important test" at its key satellite launch site at the weekend -- as its negotiating deadline approaches.
Kim's New Year speech, a key political set-piece in the isolated country, is due on January 1.
North Korea has threatened to resume referring to Trump as a "dotard", Pyongyang's favoured nickname for the US president at the height of tensions in 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger skin, foetuses found in Indonesia poacher case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The skin of a critically endangered Sumatran tiger and four foetuses have been confiscated after the arrest of several suspected poachers, Indonesian police said.
The suspects may have been planning to sell the skin to a foreign collector, while its bones were earlier sold, possibly for use in medicinal products popular in some parts of Asia, authorities said.
It was not clear how the foetuses, which were kept in a jar, were to be used.
The evidence was presented by police at a press briefing Sunday after they announced three people had been arrested at the weekend.
"We suspect that they would sell the skin to collectors, not only in Indonesia," Edward Hutapea, wildlife enforcement chief in Pekanbaru on Sumatra island, told AFP on Monday.
The suspects had previously sold another tiger skin, but had yet to unload the second skin and foetuses, he said, adding that the unborn mammals were from the big cat sold earlier this year.
If convicted, the trio could face up to five years in prison.
Poaching is responsible for almost 80 percent of Sumatran tiger deaths, according to TRAFFIC, a global wildlife trade monitoring network.
Sumatran tigers are considered critically endangered by protection group the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with fewer than 400 believed to remain in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman attacked, seriously injured by tigers she raised at California animal sanctuary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC/CNN) - The founder of a California animal sanctuary was seriously injured while in the cage with several tigers during a special event for donors.
Wildlife Environmental Conservation founder Patty Perry suffered several cuts and puncture wounds in the Saturday incident. She remains hospitalized as officials investigate.
Michael Bradbury, Perry’s friend and WEC attorney, says Perry went into the cage with the four tigers as she does every day.
"They began to play with her, and the Bengal took both paws and wrapped them around her legs. She fell on the ground and another tiger jumped on her and began to pull on her before they got her out, and she got some lacerations," he said.
Several witnesses, including members of the fire department, rushed to Perry's aid.
Bradbury says Perry is heartbroken by what happened and said she knows the animals didn’t mean to harm her.
“A lot of people, I’m sure, that saw it were horrified, thinking the worst. She said it was obvious they were playing with her because they do love her. She raised them from babies,” Bradbury said.
Bradbury said animal control is aware of the incident, but he doesn't expect any repercussions.
"It's never happened before. She's gone in on hundreds of occasions," he said.
Perry plans on returning to her tigers as soon as she’s released from the hospital. She has 50 animals at her facility, including zebras, birds of prey and leopards.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Number of people arrested since protests began breaks 6,000 mark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Police today announced that more than 6,000 people have been arrested since anti-government protests began six months ago.
Speaking to reporters at their regular 4pm press briefing this afternoon, Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of the Police Public Relations Branch confirmed that a total of 6,022 people, aged 11 to 84, have been arrested since protests began on June 9. Of those, 2,393 — or about 40 percent — are students.
Kong also said that 42 people — 37 men, and five women, aged 14 to 63 — were arrested over the weekend for offenses including rioting.
Police noted that at least 340 of those arrested were under 16, and that more than 900 people — about 15 percent of the total number arrested — have been formally charged.
In addition to the arrest figures, police also gave a rundown of crowd control weapons used since protests began. Officers have fired around 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 bean bag rounds, and 1,850 so-called “sponge grenades” — effectively a larger-caliber rubber bullet — since protests began.
They also confirmed that since June, the Complaints Against Police Office has received about 1,300 complaints against officers. They declined to comment on whether any officers had been formally suspended from duty.
Separately, the Hospital Authority has also confirmed that a total of 2,633 people have taken to hospital because of injuries sustained while taking part in protests, RTHK reports.
Six months ago today, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to express their opposition to a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland.
After months of massive protests, the extradition bill was finally withdrawn, but by then the government’s heavy-handed response to demonstrations had given rise to four other key demands, including an independent commission of inquiry into police brutality, the retraction of the the term “riot” to describe a largely peaceful June 12 protest that saw the first use of tear gas, amnesty for arrested protesters, and universal suffrage in electing the city’s leader.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Members of the public are being given the chance to be trained in counter-terrorism, for free.
An online course (ACT Awareness) is now available, which is made up of seven modules and takes 45 minutes to complete.
The coaching has been tailored by security experts and police officers, aiming to enable people to respond readily to major incidents.
It follows the London Bridge attack, which highlights the need for vigilance, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said.
Previously, only those who worked in crowded areas were offered training.
The NPCC said the decision to open up the opportunity to the public was not made in response to the attack.
Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi, senior national co-ordinator for protective security, said: "The threat level remains at substantial, meaning an attack is likely, so giving everyone the chance to be extra eyes and ears for police and local security teams helps to keep all communities safe."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wargroove developer Chucklefish has apologised over its casting process for the game’s upcoming DLC. In a statement on Twitter last week, the studio said that it “sincerely [apologised] for the harm we have caused.”
Last month, Chucklefish revealed the voice actors for Wargroove’s Double Trouble DLC. Three of the expansion’s four new arrivals are characters of colour, but all of them are voiced by white actors, resulting in a backlash from the community.
In response, Chucklefish said that “we want to be honest about what happened. During our casting process we knew that we didn’t want our own unconscious biases to impact who we hired to work on Wargroove.” As a result, the studio hired an external casting company, and handled auditions “blindly,” considering only audition files rather than headshots and back catalogues.
The studio also said that “posting photos of our voice actors beside characters of colour without acknowledgement of the systemic problem of representation in the industry was insensitive and poorly communicated.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fact check: Did it really use to snow more often in December in Germany?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For most people, a white Christmas is the ideal. However, snow is quite rare during the holidays in most of Germany. Some say it used to snow more often, but is that really true?
Presents piled under the Christmas tree, piping-hot holiday treats, plus a snow-covered landscape: that's how many imagine the perfect Christmas holidays.
But this combination is relatively rare for Germans. Was a white Christmas more common in the past? Let's look at the facts.
CLAIM: Snow during Christmas was more common in previous years.
FACT: Not true.The German Weather Service, or Der Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD), has strict requirements for a “White Christmas”: there must be at least one centimeter of snow on the ground at 7 am on all festive days (Christmas Eve as well as December 25th and 26th).

"The event was always relatively rare," explains DWD meteorologist Andreas Friedrich. Comprehensive weather data has been collected in all of Germany since 1961, but certain regions have data stretching back to 1881, according to DWD.
In 2010 there was a blanket of snow covering almost all of Germany, and in the 1960s, there were several years in a row where many places in Germany had a white Christmas. However, no general trend can be derived from these individual years, Friedrich says.
Nonetheless, the winters definitely used to be colder. According to DWD data, Germany’s December has warmed by 1.7C since 1881. In December 2018, the average temperature throughout Germany was 3.9C.

"Every children’s book and every advertisement depicts a white Christmas rather than a ‘green Christmas,’ which would be much more realistic in Germany," says Professor Joachim Curtius from the Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research at the University of Frankfurt am Main.
People tend to idealize the rare white Christmas rather than celebrations in bad weather and rain.

CLAIM: White Christmases vary depending on the German region.
FACT: That's true. There are several factors that play into the likelihood of this phenomenon. Altitude, for example, and for some regions, the distance to the ocean also plays a role. On the Heligoland islands the probability for snowy holidays is two percent, according to DWD.
And in Berlin and Brandenburg, the probability of a white Christmas is higher than in Lower Saxony.
CLAIM: There are places in Germany where snow is guaranteed on Christmas
FACT: That's right. "There has been a white Christmas on the Zugspitze since the beginning of the weather record there in 1880," says Friedrich. At lower altitudes, the probability sinks.
CLAIM: The snow probability is highest in December.
FACT: Not true. The coldest times of the year are usually from late January to early February, says DWD expert Friedrich. "If you could push Christmas to these months, it would be easier to experience a white Christmas."
According to DWD figures, it sometimes snows in mid-December, but shortly before Christmas mild Atlantic air often flows from the west to Germany.
“The notorious Christmas Thaw is coming,” writes the DWD. The warm air typically lifts any snow cover.
According to Professor Curtius, the dream of white Christmas will continue to be rare: "In the course of climate change, at least for the next decades, the likelihood of a white Christmas will continue to decline because temperatures will fall below zero less and less often.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eight fascinating things you probably didn't know about Cologne Cathedral</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne Cathedral is one of the most iconic and well-visited buildings in Germany. And it has an incredible history to match the name.1. It took over 600 years to build
The first foundation stone for the Gothic cathedral we see today was laid in August 1248. But lack of money and interest in the project meant that construction was only completed in 1880 with the assistance of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, a mere 632 years later.
2. It was bombed 14 times in WWII

The Cathedral was hit by 14 aerial bombs and more than 70 firebomb hits over the course of the Second World War. Whether by an act of God or just good luck, the building did not collapse and remained standing in an otherwise flattened city. Repairs were finished in 1956 although some bad-quality brickwork was left visible until the 1990's as a reminder of the war.
3. It houses the largest swinging church bell in the world

If you scale the 533 steps up to the South tower to look out at Cologne’s skyline, it’s also worth taking a look at St Peter’s bell while you’re up there. One of the Cathedral’s eight bells, the St Peter's bell weighs 24 tonnes and is the largest of its kind in the world. You'd be lucky to hear it toll, however, as it only rings on special public holidays like Christmas and New Year.
4. Three other churches have stood where the Cathedral is today
Today's Cathedral is supposedly built on the site of a 4th Century Roman Church, which then made way for another church in the 6th Century. This was followed by the so-called Old Cathedral in 800 A.D, which suffered lightning damage and was then burned down 300 years later to make way for the current Cathedral.
5. It was built to house the 'remains of the Three Kings'

When Archbishop Rainald von Dassel brought the "bones of the Three Kings" to Cologne after taking them from Milan when it was conquered in 1164, he was unimpressed with the Old Cathedral and so a new one was planned that would be grand enough to house the relics. From then on, every German king would make a pilgrimage after his coronation to present gifts to the remains. They believed that Christ would thus recognize them as monarch, as he had done with the Three Kings themselves.
6. There are 6 million visitors every year
According to the Cathedral's website, they receive 20,000-30,000 visitors daily, or a whopping 6 million per year. But these astoundingly high numbers aren't surprising when you consider that the Cathedral has previously been voted Germany's best attraction.
7. It was once the tallest building in the world

From 1880 to 1884, the Cathedral was the tallest building in the world, until it was beaten by the Washington Monument and then the Eiffel Tower.
Nowadays, it doesn’t hold anywhere near such an impressive title but it is still the largest Gothic church building in Northern-Europe. Its two 516 ft tall church spires are the second tallest in the world, surpassed only by the single spire of Ulm Minster which was finished in 1890, which is also in Germany.
But when the Sagrada Familia is finished in 2026 (estimated), it will be taller than both the Ulm Minster and Cologne Cathedral, robbing Germany of the title.
8. The Cathedral wasn't always so dark grey
The outside of the Cathedral is not made of black material, nor is it just dirty, instead, the sandstone which most of the building is made from reacts with the sulphuric acid in rain and turns dark grey, giving the Cathedral its distinctive dark colour over time. This is why repaired sections look much whiter and lighter than the rest of the building, although in time they will darken to match the older stone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seventh suspect arrested over killing of fireman in centre of Augsburg</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A seventh and final suspect was also arrested after a deadly attack on a passer-by in Augsburg on Friday evening.
A spokesman for the Augsburg police headquarters said on Monday that all of the suspects have now been caught.
A 49-year-old professional firefighter had been killed on Friday evening in an argument with a group of young men at Königsplatz in the centre of Augsburg in Bavaria.
The man had been at the city’s Christmas market with his wife and a couple of friends, before dining in a nearby restaurant.
There the two couples met a group of seven young men with whom they got into an argument. One of the men hit the victim in the head, causing him to fall to the ground.
His 50-year-old companion was also beaten by the group and injured in the face. The two women were not attacked and remained unharmed.

The perpetrators then fled. Emergency doctors tried to resuscitate the man on site, but the 49-year-old died in the ambulance.
Investigators arrested the first two 17-year-old suspects on Sunday.
The video surveillance, which the police installed at Augsburg's Königsplatz in December 2018, helped with the search.
One 17-year-old suspect is a German who also has Turkish and Lebanese citizenship. The other 17-year-old is a native of Augsburg with Italian citizenship.
Investigators will announce further details of the case at a press conference on Monday afternoon, they said.
Over 100 firemen held a moment of silence for their colleague at the scene of the crime on Sunday, and also laid flowers and lit candles.
Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder also gave his condolences: "We are all shaken. All our sympathies go to the fireman's family."
Surveillance ‘made the work of police much easier’
Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann (CSU) stressed the importance of video surveillance during arrests after the fatal attack.
"The images made the work of the police much easier", the CSU politician told the Augsburger Allgemeine.
The video surveillance at Königsplatz, the central point for public transport in the city, was not put in place until December 2018 as part of a state programme, the newspaper reported.

Since then, the police have been monitoring the area with 15 cameras.
"We have always pushed this, and such cases show that the demand has proven to be right," Herrmann added.
It difficult for eyewitnesses to describe the perpetrators of a crime precisely, which is why video recordings are the most important for the investigation, he said.
However, Hermann said that video surveillance should be restricted. He said: "We don't want total surveillance, it only exists in authoritarian states.”
Instead, he said, the focus should be on trying to prevent “excessive violence” in public spaces in the first place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Self-driving Ethiopia PM grants 'crisp interview' ahead of Nobel ceremony</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will not speak to the press when he arrives in Oslo Norway this week to receive the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize Award.
But Abiy on Saturday granted an unscheduled interview to a German journalist, Markus Preiss, who was in town with the new head of the European Union Commission.
The interview was on the streets of Addis Ababa with the Prime Minister seated behind the wheel of a car with a fellow passenger and the journalist posing questions from outside.
“We were only filming in the streets of Addis – when a car stopped: How I met Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed,” the journalist wrote. The interaction went as follows:
Markus: You are driving yourself?Abiy: There is no interview, I’m just saying how are you guys doing?
Journalist: Good, how did you find the first visit (of the EU delegation) today?Abiy: Great, amazing, she is a real change maker, we are so happy that she decided to come here first and I hope we will work a very good job with (the) European Union. With the new vibe, with the new leadership we are so happy and grateful.
Journalist: It’s great to see you.Abiy: Great to see you too.Enjoy, enjoy your filming.
Journalist: Good luck in Oslo.Abiy: After tomorrow, yes, I will be there.
Journalist: Congratulations.Abiy: Thank you very much.
It is not the first time Abiy is filmed driving himself. He has in the past driven guests who came to Ethiopia. A typical case in point was the United Arab Emirates Crown Prince in 2018.
When the EU Commission chief was also in Addis Ababa, Abiy took the initiative of driving her around town. Earlier this year whiles on a trip to Eritrea, he actually drove his host President Isaias Afwerki around in Asmara.
On other driving duties, Abiy was behind the wheel of a water tanker late Sunday afternoon watering trees that Ethiopians had planted in a yet-to-be certified world record move earlier this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Conservative scorecard now a factor in race for NY-27</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If the Conservative Party bestows any “badge of honor” on New York politicians, it might be its perfect score of 100% when assessing State Legislature votes.
And if you’re campaigning for the Republican and Conservative nods in the state’s "reddest" congressional district, no badge may shine brighter.
That’s why Republican State Sen. Robert G. Ortt of North Tonawanda is crowing a bit this week after scoring perfectly in 2019, just as he and others shout their conservative credentials for a special 27th Congressional District election anticipated on April 28.
“It’s a tangible sign that backs up what we have been saying in this process,” Ortt said. “Now the Conservative Party of New York State says it, too.”
Conservatives routinely rate senators and members of the Assembly following each year’s legislative session. And it comes as no surprise that Republicans hailing from the state’s more conservative districts capture top honors.
But the score stands out this year because a possible five Republicans may be angling to succeed Chris Collins in the House of Representatives following his Sept. 30 resignation. More than any other issue at this early stage, each is attempting to out-do the other in emphasizing their rightward leanings.
“Being Conservative isn’t about a party or a label, it’s about standing by the principles of smaller government, less taxes and economic freedom, no matter the cost,” said Republican Assemblyman Steve Hawley of Genesee County, who is contemplating a candidacy and scored 92% in the Conservative Party report.
The scores also weigh more heavily this year because of efforts to paint State Sen. Christopher L. Jacobs of Buffalo – another declared Republican candidate – as “not conservative enough” for the 27th District. Conservatives rated him at 84%, which is far above most Democrats and even above the 80% scored by Senate Minority Leader John J. Flanagan.
Jacobs said Friday he had received a “congratulatory” phone call earlier in the day from state Conservative Chairman Gerard Kassar on his score.
“He called to say I was ‘clearly conservative,’ ” Jacobs said. “I agree.”
The senator noted his lower score stemmed from not voting on two bills included in the Conservative scorecard while he was excused for the birth of his daughter.
“I would have voted with the Conservatives and that would have given me more than 90%,” he said, adding he earned party demerits for supporting measures to reduce greenhouse gases and prohibit coastal oil and gas drilling.
“I don’t agree with any organization 100% of the time,” he said, adding he feels “very confident” that Conservative leaders will back his candidacy when a special election is called.
But Jacobs is continually called upon to defend his conservative credentials, even with a healthy scorecard. Indeed, a Washington political action committee called Club for Growth is already attacking him in mailings and broadcast ads as incompatible with the district’s conservative values and not leaning far enough rightward.
And a potential candidate – Erie County Comptroller Stefan I. Mychajliw Jr. – constantly blasts Jacobs for the same reason, even though he has yet to enter the race.
Former Darien Town Justice Beth A. Parlato is also running and also emphasizes her conservatism, but like Mychajliw received no party score because she is not a legislator.
In addition, the ratings underscore the crucial need for Conservatives and the GOP to settle on one candidate for the special election. If the two parties choose separately, observers note, a Democrat could split the opposition and pull off an upset.
“We’re making our case to the Republicans about the necessity of making sure both parties are unified,” Ortt said. “You don’t want a split on April 28 because that would open an opportunity for the Democrats.”
Erie County Conservative Chairman Ralph C. Lorigo noted the circumstances surrounding Jacobs’ score as well as his “not that bad” 84%. But he added that the ratings will be taken into consideration at nomination time.
He also acknowledged the dilemma of choosing among candidates who all proudly proclaim their conservatism.
“There is no question that the nomination in this case will present a difficult situation for all of us,” he said. “There are good people running for this seat, and a lot to take into account.”
Ortt said last week he would not judge Jacobs or any other colleague in the Legislature because each tries to reflect his or her own district. He said leaders (like Flanagan) often must sign on to compromise measures and that legislators must often represent constituent wishes.
But he also noted that the 2019 session featured a blitz of “extreme and ultra-progressive policies” pushed by the Legislature’s new Democratic majority, and that more conservative votes than usual were required.
“I would think we would all be in the 90s,” he said.
Ortt also said his Senate district resembles a “microcosm” of the 27th District and that he has provided effective representation.
“These are the things I believe in and advocate for,” he said. “I’m not some Johnny-come-lately running for Congress.”
Other Senate scores included 92% for Republicans Patrick M. Gallivan of Elma and 96% for Michael H. Ranzenhofer of Amherst. Democrat Timothy M. Kennedy of Buffalo, who ran with Conservative backing in his first Senate election and while in the Erie County Legislature, scored 12% in the new Conservative report.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The foster children arrived unexpectedly on Gabriel and Jeanette Lopez's wedding day.
Erie County Child Protective Services brought Justice, 6, Bishop, 2, and Angel, 3 months old, to the South Buffalo couple just hours before the ceremony in March 2015 at J's White Elephant in Lackawanna.
"I was getting my hair done for the wedding, and the social worker said they had an emergency situation with the children and were bringing them," Jeanette Lopez recalled.
The couple – the children's aunt and uncle – wasn't expecting the children until after tying the knot but say they wouldn't have had it any other way that day. Or any day since.
"Fostering is an amazing, amazing opportunity to do the ultimate sacrifice to help a child," Gabriel Lopez said. "I wouldn't take it back for anything in the world. Having this opportunity to be in their lives and go through this journey with them, and have them be all together is our greatest accomplishment in life."
Gabriel and Jeanette developed a close friendship growing up blocks from where they now live. It grew into a romantic relationship. The couple became foster parents, in part, because they wanted to ensure the children stayed together rather than run the risk of being separated. They formally adopted them three years later.
That was before Jeanette, who already had suffered from powerful migraines, came down with a debilitating health problem that has caused the family's finances to take a nosedive.
Jeanette Lopez planned events and weddings for a catering company when she came down with myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that was triggered by an injection of Botox in March 2017. Most of her immediate family suffers from autoimmune problems, too.
"She was thriving, got a nice big raise, and was well on her way to having a successful career when she got sick," Gabriel Lopez said.
For two years, Jeanette Lopez was barely able to talk and form words. Surgery to remove her thymus gland helped, but she still has trouble swallowing, suffers from memory loss and is often sapped of energy.
The 37-year-old woman collects Social Security disability insurance and is on Medicare. She's been told her health problems won't allow her to work again.
"I try to limit my activity during the day because I get really tired, and I want to make sure I have enough energy for dinner and to help with the children's homework," she said.
Gabriel Lopez, who works as a grill cook at Outback Steakhouse in Amherst, also has health issues. He is expecting to undergo a fifth hernia surgery in 2020, plus he has developed psoriasis and struggles with his weight.
The couple say it has taken a village to help them keep their heads above water.
They expressed gratitude to their landlord, Lopez's boss at Outback Steakhouse, friends, family and the Valley Community Association, where the children attend day care and after-school programs and attended summer programs, too.
"I don't know how we would have been able to do anything without them," said Jeanette Lopez.
"I can't tell you all the people who helped us along the way," Gabriel Lopez said. "Yesterday, a good friend I grew up with who is a barber came to my house and cut the kids' hair for me," he said, noting the barber charged only a nominal fee.
Lori Overdorf, the association's director of development and youth services, said the Lopezes are special people.
"The amount of grace, generosity, compassion and patience Gabe and Jeanette have displayed is truly remarkable," Overdorf said. "They took the kids in and, since Day One have only looked out for the kids' best interests, and taken every step possible to keep the kids together as a family unit."
The Valley Community Association is sponsoring the family for Christmas. Last year, a neighbor held a holiday party in which people donated gift cards to the Lopezes.
Still, even with all the help, this time of year is tough, the couple said.
"It's difficult because the bills don't stop because its the holidays," Gabriel Lopez said.
They are also aware that their children – Justice is now 11, Bishop is 7, and Angel is 4 – see other kids getting computers and other gadgets or toys as holiday presents and going on vacation.
"I would love to show them more than Buffalo," Jeanette Lopez said. "We haven't been able to even take them on a vacation ever, and that's our dream, to take them to Disney World.
"They never ask for anything crazy, but we would love to get them stuff that they really want," she said. "But sometimes it's hard to even get food, especially with the fixed income I'm on."
"It is a struggle, but there are a lot of other people who have it worse than we do," Gabriel Lopez said. "We're never ones to just lay down. We are both very hardworking people, and we try to do our best to still try to help other people and do anything we can to not just sit around and live a glass-is-half-empty kind of life," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bakery owner 'devastated' by demolition, says city must police absentee landlords</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As Susan Adamucci drove her 12-year-old son to school last Wednesday, she heard on the radio that a building was in peril in downtown Buffalo.
A short time later she learned the property being torn down included Two Wheels Bakery & Cafe, which she opened in April 2018 as the city's lone fully gluten-free bakery.
Adamucci estimated the overall loss in bakery and restaurant equipment at between $80,000 and $90,000.
"This whole experience has been devastating," Adamucci said. "I have a family. I'm the sole breadwinner in that family, and I put a lot of time and money and energy and love into this venture."
The emergency demolition at 435 Ellicott St. was issued after the roof collapsed inside the 1860s-era, three-story Italianate brick building. Adamucci rushed to the site, but could only watch helplessly knowing her two ovens, double refrigerator and freezer – as well as a ventless hood and an exhaust hood that by themselves cost $39,000 – were irretrievable.
Adamucci, 50, is expecting to find out this week if she will recoup equipment losses from her insurance company. She also plans to sue property owner Bruce Adler of Buffalo Properties Ltd., registered downstate in Nyack, to cover lost income and other losses.
This was the second major structural collapse at the building over the past 3½ months.
Two Wheels Bakery had been closed since Aug. 21, when a chimney crumbled, damaging the roof and causing bricks to fall on the south side of the building.
In addition to Two Wheels, the building had two upstairs apartments that also became uninhabitable that day.
Flying bricks also forced the closure of Puppy Playpen, located in an Adler-owned building next door.
A structural engineering report called for by the city specified the damages in need of repair.
"At that point, the building was definitely salvageable," Adamucci believed. "All Adler needed to do was get the roof done and repair a few rows of bricks."
But no work was done during the 104 days that transpired between the first roof collapse on Aug. 21 and the Dec. 4 emergency demolition triggered by the additional roof damage.
Adler, who owns multiple properties on Ellicott and Oak streets, has a history of housing court violations. But the seven citations written up for 435 Ellicott St. – six filed on Aug. 22, and a seventh on Sept. 4 – failed to make their way to Housing Court Judge Patrick M. Carney during that time period.
Adler, whose insurance claim in August was rejected, could not be reached to comment.
For Adamucci, the demolition capped a difficult period with her landlord that began after she signed a lease in November 2015. Adler failed to reconfigure unsafe basement stairs or put in wooden flooring stipulated in her lease, Adamucci said. She was forced to pay for the work so she withheld rent for a year to compensate, she said.
Adamucci was still determined to make the space work because she felt the location was ideal.
"I wanted to be downtown and easily accessible," Adamucci said, referring to its proximity to the Kensington Expressway. "I loved that it was at the end of the 33 to make it easy for people that were not in the city, or were even a little afraid of the city to come in, too. It also had a beautiful courtyard in the back.
"I also loved the beautiful brick building," she said. "I really felt like the building had been sitting for the most part, but we were going to bring life back to it."
Adamucci suffers from an autoimmune disease, and she opened her gluten-free bakery in April 2018 to be a safe place to eat for people unable to digest gluten. The chocolate cherry and lemon currant scones, red velvet cake, double chocolate cookies and other offerings were meant to appeal to everyone.
"A lot of people who were not gluten-free were coming in for these items," Adamucci said. "That was the concept.  When I hit a recipe and my tester said I can't even tell this is gluten-free, that's when I had a winner."
The growing business and glowing testimonials on social media gave her confidence she had made the right choice.
"We had a phenomenal summer," Adamucci said. "We were showing a lot of growth and were beginning to cover all of our operating costs," she said, noting it can take two years for a restaurant to operate in the black.
But Adamucci said she could not ultimately compensate for the landlord's neglect.
"I was just trying to run my business and make it work,' Adamucci said. "I really felt like I had this horrible landlord but if I just focused on the business and paid my rent then I would be OK. It didn't work out."
Adamucci said she has been deeply moved by the "the support and love" received the last several days. The owners of Feature Eatery, located downtown, have allowed her to use their kitchen so she can keep her wholesale business going, including baking gluten-free pies for Thanksgiving and preparing baked products for Christmas.
"They have allowed us to come into their kitchen twice a week since this happened in August, and they won't let us pay them," Adamucci said. "It makes me want to cry to think about the kindness that they have shown us."
A GoFundMe campaign to help Two Wheels recover can be found at gofundme.com/f/two-wheels-bakery-amp-cafe.
Adamucci has plans to rebound by relocating to not one but two sites.
One would be a retail baking operation she plans to open in early 2020 at a building rented at 1006 Grant St. in Black Rock.
A cafe is also planned on the West Side at the corner of Plymouth and Pennsylvania avenues. She expects to open in the spring with the help of an investor.
Adamucci said she hopes the city will be prodded by what happened to better police out-of-town landlords who don't maintain their properties.
"There's a big hole in this beautiful block," Adamucci said. "People could say it was an old building, but there are tons of buildings that are the same age that are fine.
"I hope the city will now put in place policies to hold commercial landlords responsible for these buildings that are just crumbling," she said. "Imagine if – God forbid  – anyone had gotten hurt that day."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Labor issues could plague long-delayed veterans cemetery project</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON – On top of the delays and cost overruns, the new veterans cemetery being constructed in Pembroke now potentially faces labor trouble.
The Buffalo Building and Construction Trades Council has been pushing for a project labor agreement at the site, meaning the construction contracts would have to go to unionized companies. And the local labor group has a powerful ally: Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer.
But the Department of Veterans Affairs says it's too late to include a project labor agreement at the site.
Paul Brown, the president of the building trades council, isn't happy about that.
"We're going to protest these guys," Brown said last week. "There's no question about it."
Schumer, a New York Democrat who has been the cemetery's most prominent advocate, made the case for organized labor's involvement in the project in a Nov. 19 letter to Veterans Secretary Robert Wilkie.
"Aside from providing work for local Western New Yorkers, a (project labor agreement) provides additional structure, professionalism, productivity and stability to federal construction projects and thus promotes the successful and expeditious completion of construction projects like this one," Schumer wrote.
Wilkie has not yet responded to Schumer's letter, a spokewoman for the senator said.
Brown, meanwhile, pressed that point last week in a meeting with Randy C. Reeves, the VA's undersecretary for memorial affairs, who visited the Pembroke site last week. He said a project labor agreement might be able to save costs – and that it would result in more veterans working on the construction site.
"All this guy kept talking about, this Randy guy, was he wants a place to put veterans in the ground," Brown said. "Well, what about the ones that are above it still? Come on!"
Others, however, are not nearly so thrilled with the idea of requiring union labor on a project that's already at least $10 million over its original budget.
"In my view, it's only going to muddy the water," said Patrick W. Welch, a longtime Buffalo veterans advocate who attended the meeting with Reeves last week.
The contractor on the project – Albert Urban of Global Urban Enterprises of Victor – said during the meeting that he is hiring both union and nonunion subcontractors, but that he's paying the same prevailing union wage to all of them, Welch said. Urban did not return a phone call seeking comment.
What's more, Welch said he feared that requiring union labor might run afoul of a federal law that aims to make sure that such work goes to companies owned by disabled veterans.
Meanwhile, the VA said a project labor agreement could only have been included in the original contract for the project, and that neither bidder proposed including one.
"It is against Federal Acquisition Regulation to add a PLA after the fact," said Les' Melnyk, chief of public affairs and outreach at the VA's National Cemetery Administration. "The request must be made during procurement. In the case of this acquisition, contractors could propose bids with or without a PLA."
Contractors often oppose public labor agreements, fearing they would increase costs – which have already proven to be a huge concern at the veterans cemetery.
The VA broke the Pembroke cemetery project into two phases after the first round of bids for the project came in over the $36 million in federal funding already set aside for the project.
The agency says it needs another $10 million from Congress for the next phase of the project, but in his letter to the VA secretary, Schumer expressed concerns about whether the VA's cost estimates are still off target.
He urged the agency to re-evaluate its cost estimate for the project's next phase using a 12-step process recommended by the Government Accountability Office in a recent report that criticized the VA for cost overruns at veterans cemeteries.
If that additional $10 million isn't enough, Schumer told the VA secretary: "I urge you to include additional funding in the administration's FY21 budget request to address any shortfall revealed by this re-evaluation."
Schumer also asked Wilkie to reconsider the VA's plan to delay the next phase of the project from 2020 to 2022, and to reconsider its decision to remove construction of a perimeter fence and stone wall from its cemetery plans.
Reeves, the VA undersecretary, traveled to Pembroke in part to allay concerns veterans have about the cemetery, which was first proposed more than a decade ago and that has been plagued by delays ever since.
William Joyce, the director of veterans services in Genesee County, said he was pleased with the meeting.
"I feel real confident" that there won't be any more delays or cost overruns, said Joyce, who added that Reeves is "110 percent committed" to the project.
But Welch left the meeting with doubts.
"You know, I'm an accountant by profession and when I asked specific monetary questions, I got a runaround," Welch said.
Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Patrick Welch as the Erie County veterans advocate. He no longer serves in that official capacity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can they really search my phone? Answering your border questions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you live in Western New York, you probably see Canada on the regular. Maybe even every day. The border is a backdrop to our lives, but there’s a lot we don’t know about it. That’s why we launched our series, “The Other Border,” which began in November and wraps up later this month.
Our work on the series took Buffalo News Chief Photographer Derek Gee and me across the border in New York, from the eastern-most portion of the state back to our own region. The stories delve into a range of border topics, from efforts by law enforcement to unearth drugs and other contraband to the journeys of refugees from around the world to what actually happens at a border inspection.
We've received plenty of questions from readers over the last few weeks. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked:
At ports of entry – which include all four passenger bridges in Western New York – quite a lot. Federal law allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to search vehicles and personal items such as luggage, laptop bags and purses as a matter of routine. This can happen for inbound and outbound traffic and does not require a warrant or even a level of suspicion.
Some level of suspicion, however, is required for personal searches that involve pat-downs, partial removal of clothing, or internal X-rays. These types of searches may be used, for example, to find out whether somebody is trying to carry drugs or other contraband across the border.
Yes.
Phones, cameras, computers, tablets and other electronic devices can be searched. Some of those searches have uncovered evidence pertaining to terrorist activity, child pornography, human trafficking, export control and intellectual property rights violations, visa fraud, and the smuggling of drugs, large amounts of cash and people.
But that said, devices are rarely searched – and CBP officials are quick to point that out. When I discussed this question with Chief Officer Aaron Bowker, who is public affairs liaison for the Buffalo Field Office, he provided an official CBP statement to put it in context: “In fiscal year 2019, CBP processed more than 414 million travelers at U.S. ports of entry. During that same period of time, CBP conducted 40,913 border searches of electronic devices, representing less than .01 percent of arriving international travelers.”
Some instances of electronic searches have grabbed a lot of media attention, including in The Buffalo News. They may be a small percentage, but they are sensitive, and CBP officials are precise when speaking of them. Bowker also shared an official statement that notes CBP “has established strict guidelines to ensure that these searches are exercised judiciously, responsibly and consistent with the public trust.”
Here are three ideas:
A consistent theme I’ve noticed since beginning work on this series is this: Border officials from both the United States and Canada focus most intensely on who is entering their country, or already in it. If they notice people leaving, they may give their counterparts across the border a heads up. But they won’t necessarily stop those people – nor, in many cases, can they stop them.
Wade Laughman, patrol agent in charge at U.S. Border Patrol’s Massena Station, gave me an example: “Somebody might be in here on a six-month visa to the United States, and they legally flew in on a visa that’s going to expire in a week,” he said. “(They may think), ‘You know what? I’m going to go to Canada, because it’s either that or I’m going to get deported. I don’t want to be here illegally.’ ”
Border Patrol agents may come across such a group in a place like Massena – or Plattsburgh, or even perhaps Buffalo. If those visas are still valid, then the people are in the United States legally. That can prompt a call from Border Patrol officials to their Canadian counterparts that would go something like this, in Laughman’s words: “Just so you know, these people are still valid in the United States. They’ve got visas; we can’t do anything. But tomorrow they expire, so they’re going to be coming north.”
That northward trek could happen over water, which would be the likely case here in Western New York. Or it could be through the woods or farmland, in the New York’s North Country.
Or it could be in the wide open, at Roxham Road in Champlain, the rural spot about a half-hour from Plattsburgh. That's where tens of thousands of people have crossed illegally from the United States into Quebec over the last three years to claim refugee status in Canada. Roxham is so open, and the crossings so frequent, that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have set up a building on the Quebec side of the border where they process the arrests and then the people ask for asylum.
Anywhere on the border, this dynamic changes when a person or a group is considered to be a threat, or smuggling is involved. Canadian and U.S. officials regularly share intelligence about dangerous individuals or groups, and they work together to clamp down on the smuggling of people and goods. Homeland Security Investigations, which is an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, leads Border Enforcement Security Task Forces that include law enforcement personnel from both countries. We’ll be sharing more about how those BEST teams work in the final two stories in “The Other Border” series.
During my research for this series, I spent time trying to figure out which areas of the border are most sensitive from a national security perspective. The obvious possibility in my mind was the Niagara Power Project in Lewiston. It’s located on the water, a short drive from the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, and clearly under heavy security surveillance.
I posed the question to former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who served under President Barack Obama, and who earlier this year published a book, “How Safe Are We?”
“Big pieces of critical infrastructure, like the Niagara Power Plant, to be successfully attacked would require more than one person,” she said. “It would require a group of people.” Napolitano was drawing a contrast to single shooters attacking soft targets like schools, churches and concert venues. “It’s much different than something that’s susceptible to a lone-wolf shooter,” she said, “like that happened in Parkland or like happened in Las Vegas or so forth. It’s just a different dimension.”
Whereas lone shooters may slip undetected into a less-guarded site, a group of people equipped with guns and explosives and aiming to attack a hard target are more prone to be caught. There are more people, and more elements to coordinate, and therefore more ways to stop it.
“That’s why I say that our relations with Canada and Canadian law enforcement are so important,” Napolitano said, “because when you have a conspiracy, then you have the opportunity to detect that conspiracy ahead of time, to intervene, and to prevent.”
What worries Napolitano about the United States’ critical infrastructure is cybersecurity. In her book, she cites it as one of the top three risks facing the United States.
“All of these power plants are networked,” she said. “Our banking system is networked. Our water systems are networked. They’re all susceptible to hacking, or to interference in operations through their cyber networks.”
That’s a risk that comes with no borders.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is no threat of job losses in the automobile sector and no reason for worry, Minister of State for Heavy Industries Arjun Ram Meghwal said in Rajya Sabha on Monday.
“The automobile sector is presently in a transitional phase where it has to migrate to BS VI from BS IV by April 1, 2020, the deadline given by the Supreme Court. We also have to move towards electric vehicles,” he said during Question Hour.
“Therefore, the worry (over job losses) that has been expressed, this is a recycle. There is no reason to worry. No jobs are in danger and the government has taken all required measures for improvement after speaking to stakeholders,” he said.
In a written reply, Union Heavy Industries Minister Prakash Javadekar said no closure of any automobile or ancillary manufacturing units has been reported in the past three years.
Passenger vehicle sales in India rose marginally in October aided by positive festive season sentiment and introduction of new models in utility vehicle space, just about managing to snap 11 continuous months of decline in sales, according to figures released last month by auto industry body SIAM.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A poll done for Kan 11 News on Sunday by the Canter Institute shows a small strengthening of both Blue&White and Likud, at the expense of smaller parties in their respective blocs. This does not change the relationship between the blocs.
The poll gives 35 seats to Blue&White, and 34 to Likud.
The Joint Arab List holds on to its 13 seats.
Both United Torah Judaism and Shas get 8 seats each.
Avigdor Liberman’s Israel Beiteinu is clipped down by one seat to 7.
A Naftali Bennett-Ayelet Shaked New Right party gets 6 seats – up from 3.
Labor-Gesher goes down to 5 seats from its current 6.
The Democratic camp (Meretz) is also down by a seat, from 5 to 4.
Both Habayit Hayehudi and Otzma Yehudit disappear from the political map – Habayit Hayehudi loses its current 4 seats and falls below the threshold vote.
The left-center bloc remains, according to the survey results, at its current size of 44 seats.
The rightwing bloc is strengthened by one mandate and rises to 56 at the expense of Israel Beiteinu.
In response to the question whom they would prefer as the next prime minister, 41% of respondents preferred Benjamin Netanyahu, with Benny Gantz trailing with 38%, within the margin of error.
Interestingly, according to the survey, 17% of Blue&White voters prefer Gideon Sa’ar over Gantz for prime minister.
The survey was conducted on Sunday, with 556 respondents selected out of 1,271 who were asked to participate online. The margin of error was +-4.3%.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Man City boss Pep Guardiola reportedly tracked down Fred after the Man Utd star appeared to be racially abused during Saturday’s clash.
Live footage of the game appeared to show a City fan direct a racist gesture towards the Brazilian midfielder, something that he has since denied, as per the Sun, as he has blasted accusations of being racist and making any racist gestures.

However, as noted by The Sun, he was arrested as a result and the FA are expected to launch an investigation and so time will tell what conclusion is reached on the matter.
The report does go on to note that Guardiola showed his class by tracking down Fred by the tunnel after the game to offer some words of comfort while City officials were also in discussions with their counterparts too as they are said to have insisted that they will deal with the issue.
While it’s obviously not a gesture that will gloss over the incident, it’s one that will perhaps have been appreciated by Fred and it will be reassuring for all concerned to know that the relevant steps will be taken to address the incident rather than try to sweep it under the rug.
In turn, if accurate, it’s a nice touch from Guardiola, while also perhaps confirming that the Man City camp were well aware of the incident almost immediately.
As noted in the report above though, the 41-year-old fan in question has denied that he was being racist, and so it remains to be seen what the outcome is both in terms of the police and FA investigations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Govt to recruit over 500 health workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joyce Moriku Kaducu, the state minister for primary healthcare, says the ministry has been understaffed
The Government is set to recruit 523 health workers to fill vacant positions at various regional referral hospitals and the health ministry.
The health facilities expecting new staff include the Uganda Virus Research Institute and regional referral hospitals of Moroto, Hoima, Kabale and Mubende, as well as the ministry headquarters.
The Health Service Commission has placed adverts inviting applicants to fill the vacant positions.
The applicants are required to submit their applications online at www.hscers.ug to the secretary of the Health Service Commission, not later than January 3.
The commission said it is seeking to recruit senior consultants (general surgery and internal medicine) and consultants (obstetrics, gynaecology, ENT and ophthalmology), among others.
At the health ministry headquarters, the commission has advertised 132 positions for commissioners, assistant commissioners, directors, senior research officers, senior nutritionists, principal health economist, clinical officers and engineers, among others.
In 2017, the Government started redeploying retired senior health specialists in various government-aided health facilities, in a move to boost health service delivery.
Joyce Moriku Kaducu, the state minister for primary healthcare, said the ministry has been understaffed.
She said the move to recruit senior health workers will enable the ministry to fill staffing gaps, especially at consultancy level.
“We need consultants and senior doctors to supervise our young doctors, especially the interns. Most of our consultants left because of the poor pay. So, it is these gaps that the health service commission is trying to fill,” Kaducu told New Vision in a phone interview, on Sunday.
About the pay, Kaducu said salaries for senior health workers, among others, had been increased.
At the start of this financial year, the Government increased pay for health workers, including district health officers, assistant district health officers, specialised medical officers, dental surgeons, pharmacists, consultants, senior consultants, directors referral hospitals, assistant commissioners, commissioners, directors and the director-general of health services.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young celebrity started singing as the judicial officers enjoyed his thrilling music despite being composed in Luganda.
Celebrity power on Friday swept judicial officers and support staff off their feet. This was when seven-year-old Patrick Senyonjo aka fresh kid performed at the judiciary end of year party.
When the master of ceremony mentioned the name fresh kid, most of the judicial officers and their support staff who had gathered at the high court gardens in Kampala for their end of year party stood up.
Some of them pulled out their smartphones and started filming as Fresh Kid advanced to the stage.
The young celebrity started singing as the judicial officers enjoyed his thrilling music despite being composed in Luganda.
Chief Justice Bart Katureebe, Deputy Chief Justice Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, retiring Principal Judge Dr Yorokamu Bamwiine, Justice and Constitutional minister Maj Gen. (rtd) Kahinda Otafiire, Secretary to judiciary Pius Bigirimana and Out-going Chief Registrar Esta Nambayo were visibly amused with Fresh Kid’s music.
 Bamwine was also seen dancing as the young star entertained the judicial officers.
They gave him thunderous claps and later took turns to shake his hand.
A number of judicial officers were seen taking selfies with the young teenager.
Katureebe lauded Fresh Kid and implored him to balance talent with education in order to be successful.
 
Bigirimana revealed that he got to know Fresh kid last year when he was a permanent secretary in the ministry of gender and vowed to help him realise the dream of becoming a permanent secretary.
“When I met him at the Ministry of Gender, I found that he was being cheated by his manager. I decided to divide the proceeds from his shows. I ordered that three accounts be opened for his personal saving, mother and father. I told his parents that his money should be kept on his account until he reaches maturity age and put it into proper use,” Bigirimana said.
 
Civil Division deputy registrar Sarah Langa said, “When you are the master of ceremony, you cannot miss a selfie with this kind of celeb.”
At the function, the judiciary bid farewell to over 14 judicial officers who have clocked retirement age including the outgoing principal judge Dr Yorokamu Bamwine.
Others are Supreme Court justices Jotham Tumwesigye, Augustine Nshimye, Eldad Mwangusya, high court judges Margaret Oumo-Oguli, Moses Mukiibi, Billy Kainamura, and Rugadya Atwooki.
 
Others include registrars Thaddeus Opefeni, Joy Kabagye and Magistrates Francis Nkurunziza, Simon Peter Odo and Mukasa Namagembe.  
Each of them was recognised for their dedicated service to the judiciary

    <h5 class="mb-1">House GOP Lawyer’s ‘Straw Man’ Argument: Impeaching the President Over ‘8 Lines’ Is ‘Baloney’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Castor, who you may remember from the House Intelligence Committee phase of the impeachment inquiry, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday to present the case as to why the president should not be impeached. Castor argued during his opening statement that it would be “baloney” to impeach President Donald Trump over “eight lines” in the non-verbatim memo of Trump’s infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
It was an argument immediately called out as a combination of “straw man” and a “red herring.”
Watch Castor’s statement below:
Castor said that rather than violating his oath of office, President Trump took care to faithfully execute the laws. He echoed George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley’s criticism of Democrats, about undertaking a so-called “rushed impeachment.” (Turley was one of four constitutional law experts who testified last week, and the only expert called by Republicans. The other three, called by Democrats, all said it was clear Trump committed impeachable offenses.)
“The artificial and arbitrary political deadline by which Democrats are determined to finish impeachment by Christmas leads to a rushed process and missed opportunities to obtain relevant information,” Castor said.
Castor went on to make some arguments that raised the eyebrows of numerous observers.
“Democrats didn’t even try to hold witness who defied subpoenas in contempt.”

The implications of discrediting Michael Cohen, the president’s now-incarcerated former longtime attorney and fixer… while the president’s current personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.
The Mueller investigation was too long, and this one is too short.
Castor focused on the “process” and Democrats, not the substance of the allegations against the president.

Lying about a “key point”? We know the Ukrainians knew military aid was withheld before it was publicly reported for the first time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US SEC Re-Opens Infamous Bitcoin Scammer Case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to recent documents, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes that the case against the serial Ponzi scammer, Renwick Haddow, has yet to be properly solved.
The United States SEC does not appear to be satisfied with the New York Southern District Court judge’s decision regarding the case against Renwick Haddow. Judge Lorna G. Schofield ordered the closure of the case, which the SEC initially brought against the widely renowned scammer.
According to the latest report however, the regulator is now seeking to re-open the case, claiming that there are still several matters to be solved, particularly when it comes to monetary penalties that the United States SEC wishes to see imposed on the Ponzi fraudster.
Haddow is known for a number of high profile schemes, but his US-based hot-desking business known as Bar Works is likely the best-known one. The scheme essentially sold fake investments in unused restaurants and bars across several American cities, including NYC and San Francisco. However, he also had a temporary office in Istanbul.
He scammed over 100 UAE investors, who claimed to have lost millions of dirhams in this particular scheme.
His other big scams involved fronting a corporate network known as the ‘Capital Organization,’ which consisted of 30 shell companies responsible for conning investors out of a total of $180 million, according to a 2015 World Policy report . And also his so-called Bitcoin Store Inc and 7th Avenue companies, which he used to steal $37 million from unsuspecting investors between 2015-17.
The SEC initially brought the case against Haddow due to several of his fraudulent operations. Following the court’s decision that the case should be closed, the SEC sent letters and requests to Judge Lorna G. Schofield, requesting that the court re-opens the case. The SEC complaint is that the court has yet to resolve the issue of monetary penalties.
The regulator also anticipates that two scenarios might be possible once Haddow is sentenced. The first one will see the parties reach a monetary relief settlement, while the other will lead the regulator to make a motion to seek monetary relief on its own.
For now, Haddow remains permanently restrained, as per the consent judgment. He is also forbidden to use any national securities exchange, as well as any instrumentality of interstate commerce. Simply put, the judgment will see him completely cut off from security trades.
This decision was brought to stop him from conducting another scheme, mislead others, or engage in any practice of business that might result in a new fraud.
Earlier this year, in May, Haddow (who also goes by the alias Jonathan Black) admitted that he was involved in schemes regarding Bar Works and Bitcoin Store Inc. However, Haddow was originally charged two years prior, in June 2017.
He was also extradited from Morocco almost a year later, in April 2018. At the time, he was also charged with wire fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud, to which he pleaded guilty.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SCOTUS Declines to Consider Challenge of Controversial Kentucky Abortion Law</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United State Supreme Court announced on Monday that it declined to consider the challenge to a Kentucky law requiring doctors to show patients ultrasounds before they receive an abortion.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a challenge against the law in September. They described the statute as a coercive tactic to get patients to avoid abortions.
“Kentucky’s mandatory narrated ultrasound law forces doctors to display and describe a patient’s ultrasound images against the patient’s will — while they are lying on the exam table, half-naked, with a probe inside their vagina,” theywrote. “The only reason to force doctors to display and describe an ultrasound before an abortion — against a patient’s will — is to shame and coerce someone who has decided to end a pregnancy. The Supreme Court should strike these laws down once and for all.”
Four justices must sign off for the entire court to hear the case.
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the law. The petitioners, including the EMW Women’s Surgical Center, challenged it on First Amendment grounds. From the ACLU’s petition for a writ of certiorari:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Massive US military convoy arrives base in western Iraq: media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIRUT, LEBANON (12:20 P.M.) – A massive U.S. military convoy reportedly arrived in western Iraq this week amid recent attacks carried out near their installations inside the country.
According to Al-Sumaria TV, the U.S. military convoy consisted of 500 vehicles that entered Iraq from neighboring Jordan.
The U.S. military convoy reportedly reached their final destination at the ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base in Iraq’s Al-Anbar province.
No further details were released regarding the alleged U.S. military convoy.
Last week, a rocket attack was reported near the ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base in the Heet District of Al-Anbar – no one claimed responsibility for the projectile fire.
Since then, at least two more attacks were reported near U.S. military installations in Iraq, with the most recent taking place around the Baghdad International Airport.
The ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base is the second largest installation under the U.S. military’s control in Iraq; it was previously under attack by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Daesh) terrorist organization for three years before their defeat in late 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China’s advanced type PCL191 multiple rocket system in strategic proximity to Taiwan – reports</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A report in the latest issue of Modern Ships praises the Chinese multiple launch rocket system called the Type PCL191 as the most cutting-edge piece of weaponry capable of firing both rockets and ballistic missiles. The modular launcher appears to be based on the AR3 system intended for the export market.
Unlike other weaponry on display in Beijing during China’s National Day military parade on 1 October, the Type PCL191, dubbed by CCTV as “a self-propelled rocket launcher with precision strike capability”, traveled up and down the streets of the capital loaded on the back of heavy-duty trucks almost anonymously, the report has it.
It also gives an in-depth description of the system’s capacity saying it can carry eight 370 mm (14½ inch) rockets – each with a range of 350 km (220 miles) – or two 750 mm Fire Dragon 480 tactical ballistic missiles, capable of flying up to 500 km.
According to PLA Daily, an MLRS brigade was stationed with the 72nd Group Army in Huzhou, in the province of Zhejiang on China’s eastern seaboard. Separately, per an a military source unnamed due to the sensitivity of the subject, another PCL191 brigade is based to the south of Huzhou, in Xiamen, Fujian Province, the closest place to Taiwan on mainland China.
The Taiwan Strait, which separates the mainland from Taiwan deemed by Beijing as a part of China’s sovereign territory, is no more than 180 km across.
Speaking to CCTV in October, Wang Tanshen, a master sergeant with the 72nd Group Army’s artillery brigade, noted that the range of the new launch system exceeded that of its closest predecessor by “seven times”.
“The new generation MLRS has extended our firing range to cover everywhere we want to hit”. he remarked.
According to Song Zhongping, a military commentator for Phoenix Television in Hong Kong, Chinese scientists’ extremely hard work is behind the state-of-the-art capabilities and range of the PLA’s multiple launch rocket systems.
“Chinese MLRS technology has kept pace with American products, which have also successfully merged rockets and missiles”, the former instructor with the PLA’s Second Artillery Corp said.
He further elaborated on what exactly had been specially developed in the PCL191s, which require only three people to operate them.
“Scientists have upgraded the chassis [of the trucks that carry the launchers], the explosives [used to propel the rockets and missiles], and other technologies to extend the firing range of the MLRS and improve its precision strike capabilities”, he said.
Chinese missiles and rockets are guided by the domestically designed BeiDou navigation satellite system, the closest rival to the United States’ GPS system.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unknown gunmen attack Syrian intelligence checkpoint in Daraa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIRUT, LEBANON (12:00 P.M.) – A group of unknown gunmen carried out an attack on a checkpoint belonging to the Syrian Air Force Intelligence in eastern Daraa this morning.
According to local reports, the gunmen, who were suspected to be members of a Free Syrian Army (FSA), Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) or Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Daesh) sleeper cell, opened fire on the checkpoint before fleeing in an unknown direction.
The reports said there were casualties among the Syrian Air Force Intelligence personnel; however, the total dead and wounded is unknown.
These attacks by the FSA, HTS, and ISIS sleeper cells have decreased over the last four months, thanks in large part to the increase of Syrian Army troops in the Daraa Governorate.
However, with the absence of Syrian military personnel in some of the reconciled towns in the Daraa Governorate, it has been difficult to crackdown on these sleeper cells.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Africom confirms Russian air defense system downed US drone in Libya</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">U.S. Africa Command (Africom) has confirmed that an unarmed American drone over the Libyan capital last month was shot down by Russian air defenses, reported Reuters.
Africom dropped three headlines via Reuters in the overnight, revealing how the surveillance drone was shot down over Tripoli.
The headlines specify Russian military contractors have operated alongside east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya’s bloody civil war. The contractors used Russian missile defense systems last month to shoot down a US drone.
Africom’s Gen. Stephen Townsend told Reuters in a statement that he believes the Russian air defense operators “didn’t know it was a US remotely piloted aircraft when they fired on it.”
“But they certainly know who it belongs to now and they are refusing to return it. They say they don’t know where it is, but I am not buying it,” Townsend said.
Africom’s spokesman Air Force Col. Christopher Karns told Reuters that either Russian military contractors or Haftar’s Libyan National Army were operating Russian missile launchers at the time the incident was reported around Nov. 21.
Karns said Africom believes air defense operators accidentally shot down the US drone after “mistaking it for an opposition” aircraft.
Townsend also said Russia’s increasing presence in Oil-rich Libya had alarmed Africom.
“This highlights the malign influence of Russian mercenaries acting to influence the outcome of the civil war in Libya, and who are directly responsible for the recent and sharp increase in fighting, casualties and destruction around Tripoli,” Townsend said.
Libya was thrown into civil war nearly a decade ago when NATO forces overthrew Moammar Gadhafi. It’s been another great blunder for Western military forces who’ve spent the last several decades crusading around the Middle East.
The latest outbreak of fighting has been based in Tripoli. Since about 2015, Libya has seen its government splintered into two, one based in Tripoli and the other in the country’s east. The eastern government forces have been attempting to recapture Tripoli since April, and fierce fighting in the capital continues into the late year.

Heavy rains have devasted South Africa’s Gauteng Province after massive flash floods resulted in parts of the City of Centurion going underwater. Midrand and Pretoria have also been negatively affected, but the flooding is not quite as bad as that in Centurion.
The rains which have been incessant for the past 5 days are so bad that the Centurion Lake Hotel has actually been flooded.
In other news: Jacob Zuma Poisoned, Rushed To ‘Secret’ Hospital in Cuba for treatment?
The rumour mill is on overdrive after suggestions that former President Jacob Zuma was whisked away “incognito” style to Cuba for an emergency medical procedure after sources claimed he was poisoned.
This would be the second time Jacob Zuma would have been poisoned after the first attempt was allegedly orchestrated by his wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma, known as MaNtuli in 2014 whilst he was president. She was not prosecuted for the alleged poisoning attempt owing to an apparent total lack of evidence.
South Africans, however, are not impressed with the news citing that the former president should be treated in South Africa and not Cuba.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deutsche Bank analysts suggest that the market is expecting no changes in interest rates from the ECB this week but the meeting will be closely watched as it’s the first monetary policy decision since President Lagarde came to office.
“It’ll be interesting to see what she says in the subsequent press conference, and whether there are any updates on the upcoming strategic review. In their preview out late last week, our European economists write that they expect the Governing Council “will likely remain cautious and view the balance of risks as still tilted to the downside.” Yet they also say that they think Lagarde will make an immediate change, and they say that “we expect the willingness to use “all instruments” to be conditioned on an assessment of the possible side effects of policy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson says he will stop immigrants treating Britain 'as their own country'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boris Johnson has vowed to stop European migrants treating the United Kingdom “as their own country” if he wins this week’s general election.
The prime minister on Sunday told Sky News: “”You’ve seen quite a large number of people coming in from the whole of the EU – 580 million population – able to treat the UK as though it’s basically part of their own country and the problem with that is there has been no control at all and I don’t think that is democratically accountable.
He added: “You have got to have a system by which politicians can say to people, ‘Well, yes, we are letting people in but we are doing it in a way that is controlled and checked’.”
The prime minister has promised to reduce net migration if returned to Downing Street.
To do this, he has said he will introduce a points-based system of the sort used in Australia, under which migrants wishing to come to the UK will be given one of three visas depending on their perceived skills level.
Johnson said migrants with “exceptional talents” would be given the most rights to live and work in the UK. Skilled workers, like those in the NHS, would be permitted to move to the UK as long as they had jobs waiting for them. The third group, “unskilled” workers, would be given short-stay visas to work in sectors suffering from shortages.
The Migration Advisory Committee, the independent body that advises ministers on migration policy, would have the power to decide how many migrants each sector needs.
Johnson guaranteed that this system would reduce the number of immigrants after Britain leaves the EU, telling Ridge: “Yes, I can make sure that numbers will come down because we’ll be able to control the system in that way.”
However, experts have questioned Johnson’s proposals and criticised his framing of immigration.
Jonathan Portes, a professor at Kings College London, told the Guardian newspaper that the proposed system undervalued the skills of migrants and would lead to shortages in certain sectors.
“There’s a damaging misconception in this debate that there’s a binary divide between the brain surgeons and the people who pick strawberries – most ordinary immigrants are somewhere in between. Doing jobs that require skills but aren’t necessarily highly skilled, and they would not pass this particular test,” Portes said.
“Butchers, for example, or people who work in abattoirs – this is hard work and you need training. Most come from eastern Europe but are unlikely to make the highly skilled cut.”
The Institute for Government think tank has previously expressed doubt that the UK Home Office, which is responsible for migration, could design and implement entire new immigration system in time for Brexit.
Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats’ Shadow Home Secretary, accused Johnson of “demonising” EU citizens who “contribute so much to our NHS, social care and economy”
She told Business Insider: “This dog-whistle politics is straight out of Nigel Farage or Donald Trump’s playbook.
“Conservative plans to end free movement would mean fewer EU nurses and care workers, and fewer opportunities for UK citizens to move abroad.
“Neither Johnson or Corbyn are standing up for free movement and for the millions of EU nationals who are our friends, colleagues and neighbours. Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Boris, stop Brexit and build a brighter future for the country.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">25 Vital Festive Road Safety Tips</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, over 10 000 people have lost their lives on South African roads during the festive season in the past six years.  With many motorists taking to the roads again this month, Dialdirect implores motorists to be vigilant.
“The true tragedy here is that the bulk of these deaths could have been avoided if motorists took road safety more seriously,” says Maanda Tshifularo, Head of Dialdirect Insurance. “All too often, the price is higher than a damaged or written off vehicle.”
According to JMPD Chief Superintendent, Wayne Minnaar: “The main offenses that motorists commit which cause accidents include speeding, dangerous overtaking and ignoring of white lines, drunken driving, reckless driving, disregarding stop signs and red traffic lights, turning in face of oncoming traffic, entering the road in an unsafe manner, and turning from the wrong lane.”
Dialdirect have put together a list of practical tips to assist you drive right and avoid becoming a statistic this festive season:
CHECKLIST:
GOOD DRIVING PRACTICE:
FATIGUE:
BIKES AND HEAVY MOTOR VEHICLES:
IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN OR YOU’RE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT:
“It is up to each of us to take proactive action to reduce road deaths, but despite our best efforts, tragedy still does strike,” Tshifularo concludes, “It is an absolute must to make sure that you are comprehensively insured so that you can be up and running again in no time.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saif Ali Khan On Struggling Days: “People Felt I Looked Like A Girl… Akshay Kumar Looked Like A Hero”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saif Ali Khan is one of the most genuine and classy actors we have in Bollywood. His character as Sartaj Singh in Sacred Games wasn’t just applauded by his fans, but critics as well. His last film, Laal Kaptaan, didn’t work great at the box office but his performance won the hearts of audience.
Talking about the hardships in Bollywood, Saif told Pinkvilla that he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do after school. He just didn’t want to do a 9-5 job and hence thought, films are better than that. “I was clueless after school and I didn’t know what to do when I joined films. I just knew I didn’t want to do a desk job. I thought I’ll die if I have to do a 9-5 thing. The idea of films was very different because of the variety of the job,” Saif said.
He further added, “Cricket was in my blood, it’s treated like religion. Not just my dad, my grandad also captained India and played against Don Bradman. I played good cricket and I never played in school or college. What let me down is that cricket is a very mental game, it’s about patience and timing. That I was strongly lacking in and that’s why my cricket career was doomed.”
During the initial days in the industry, Saif revealed how people would tell her that he looked and sounded like a girl in auditions. “People have been nasty. They have been mean. People talk about your looks. I guess I didn’t look like a hero. Akshay Kumar did. They felt I looked like a girl. I certainly had a bad voice which I hadn’t worked on. So sometimes, I was squeaking away in an English accent,” Saif added.
Well, all’s well that ends well. Isn’t it?
On the work front, he will be next seen in Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior opposite Ajay Devgn and the trailer has already garnered him praises from all around.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SERAP gives States seven days to disclose payments of pensions to ex-governors, others</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Governors’ Forum, Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and other 34 governors urging them to use their “leadership position to urgently disclose details of payment of pensions to former governors and other ex-officials between 1999 and 2019 under your state’s pension law, and to provide a copy of the said pension law.”
The organization is also urging each of the 36 state governors to “provide information on whether any such pension law exists in your state, and if so, to provide the names and number of ex-governors and other ex-officials receiving pensions in your state, and to publicly commit to repealing the law, and to pursue recovery of funds collected under the pension law.”
In the letter dated December 9, 2019 and signed by SERAP’s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: “Public officials should not encourage, sustain, or implement jumbo pension laws that show an appearance of conflict of interest, impropriety or create situation of personal enrichment. The pension law negates the duty to act honestly and to represent the needs and concerns of the people, and to refrain from activities, which interfere with the proper discharge of public functions.”
SERAP also said: “Any such pension law also represents the use of public office to advance private interests at the expense of some public interest, suggests the misuse of legitimate discretion for improper reasons, and has created a more cynical public view of politics and politicians.”
According to the organization, “Those who manage the resources of the state ought to protect the interest of the people in their states. Public officials while entrusted with duties and discretions are not to act in their own best interest, but to discharge those duties and exercise those powers in the interests of the public.”
SERAP’s FoI request read in part: “Repealing any such pension law would demonstrate your commitment to public service and the requirements of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). It would show that you would not tolerate the use of public office in a manner which ignores the public interest in order to achieve personal advantage.
“We would be grateful if the requested information is provided to us within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the Registered Trustees of SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions under the FoI Act to compel you to comply with our request.
“Pension law for former governors and other senior ex-officials represents a conflict with the constitutional and legal conflict code of conduct for public officials, and would seem to prioritise private interest of former state officials over and above the public interest and public duties of state governors.
“The duties on public officials including governors flowing from their position as trustees to the public also include the duty to refrain from activities which interfere with the proper discharge of their functions, and the duty not to place themselves in a position where public duty conflicts with private interest.”
SERAP’s request is coming on the heels of the landmark judgment delivered last week by Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo of the Federal High Court, Lagos ordering the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to challenge the legality of states’ pension laws permitting former governors and other ex-public officials to collect such pensions.
The judgment followed the invalidated pension law for former governors and other ex-public officers in Zamfara State, which provided for the upkeep of ex-governors to the tune of N700 million annually.
The state has produced three former governors since 1999.
SERAP’s FoI request further read: “This request is consistent with your constitutional, fiduciary and public service roles, and the spirit of the landmark judgment delivered last week by Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo of the Federal High Court, Lagos in the suit brought by SERAP.
“By Section 1 (1) of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2011, SERAP is entitled as of right to request for or gain access to information, including information on any life pension law for former governors and other senior ex-officials in your states and the details of payments to such officials over the years.
“By Section 4 (a) of the FoI Act, when a person makes a request for information from a public official, institution or agency, the public official, institution or urgency to whom the application is directed is under a binding legal obligation to provide the applicant with the information requested for, except as otherwise provided by the Act, within 7 days after the application is received.
“By Sections 2(3)(d)(V) & (4) of the FoI Act, there is a binding legal duty to ensure that documents containing information relating to any life pension law for former governors and other senior ex-officials in your states and the details of payments to such officials over the years are widely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means.
“The information being requested does not come within the purview of the types of information exempted from disclosure by the provisions of the FoI Act. The information requested for as indicated above, apart from not being exempted from disclosure under the FoI Act, bothers on an issue of national interest, public concern, interest of human rights, social justice, good governance, transparency and accountability.”

Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae has been treated for smoke inhalation after a fire in his office/shop earlier this morning.
Emergency services were called to the Kilgarvan village complex which houses his post office and sorting office as well as his political office and shop.
The blaze is believed to have broken out around the fuse board of the filling station in Kilgarvan this morning.
Gardaí are not treating the fire as suspicious.
They say all early indications are that it was accidental.
The emergency services including an ambulance from University Hosptial Kerry was dispatched to the scene and Mr Healy Rae was treated for smoke inhalation, it is believed.
Danny Healy-Rae told Radio Kerry his brother is fine but has gone to hospital as a precaution.
"Michael put out the fire and as a result he has enhaled a bit of smoke," said Danny.
"He's fine, but it was decided that he should go for an x-ray to check himself out.
"It's a shock because it was a bit scary for a few minutes until it was brought under control."

This by-poll was necessitated after 15 Congress MLAs decided to rebel in the state which led to the dismissal of the Kumaraswamy led government. The rebels were later disqualified by the Supreme Court which led to the by-polls.
The BJP currently has 106 seats in the state and if the trends stand, it will comfortably surpass the majority mark of 113.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Malaysia registered the first case of polio in 27 years, the France Press reported, citing the Malaysian Ministry of Health.
A three-month-old baby, originally from the city of Tuaran in Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island, was admitted to a hospital with symptoms of fever and muscle weakness on Friday, the ministry said. The baby is treated in "an isolation ward and is in stable condition, but still requires assistance to breathe," Noor Hisham Abdullah, Director General of Health said in a statement.
In 2000, Malaysia was declared polio-free. The last case of the disease was registered in 1992.
Public health expert T. Jayabalan told AFP he was not surprised by the case, as poliovaccine is not mandatory in Malaysia.
“This first case probably is the tip of the iceberg. There is a very high possibility of a rising trend,” he warned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DENR wants public, stakeholders to help solve garbage crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Benny Antiporda, Undersecretary for Solid Waste Management and Local Government Units Concerns, said Environment and Natural Resources  Secretary Roy Cimatu stressed that the  country, particularly Metro Manila, “is in the middle of a garbage crisis” and will need a concerted effort among all sectors to solve it.
“Solid waste management is not the government’s responsibility alone, it is everyone’s business,” Antiporda said.
Cimatu’s declaration came amid government efforts to revive the heavily polluted Manila Bay, which is the repository of trash and untreated sewage from households and businesses in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
“We shouldn’t wait for the time when there will be more trash than fish in the ocean,” said Antiporda, noting the situation will get worse without the efforts of everybody.
Antiporda added that LGUs  also play a crucial role in solid waste management having been tasked to ensure proper waste segregation and disposal under RA 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000.
Under this law, LGUs are required to come up with their respective 10-year Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP) and convert open dumpsites into sanitary landfills.
The NSWMC has already fast-tracked the approval of SWMPs of hundreds of LGUs nationwide, while the DENR closed down some open dumpsites and filed criminal and administrative charges against local officials allowing their operation.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Under Executive Order 99 issued by Duterte on December 6, the 2019 Yuletide social assistance program will be created through an ordinance to be passed by the local legislative body.
“The Yuletide season is an opportune time to establish such measures or programs for the economic empowerment of barangay officials and functionaries, in recognition of their valuable and meaningful service that effect genuine and positive change in their respective communities,” the EO stated.
Duterte directed the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to jointly issue the appropriate guidelines such as the components of the program and the specific criteria and parameters for the determination of the qualified barangay officials and functionaries.
The expenses for the program will be charged against the barangay’s available funds.
For the succeeding years, the DILG, in consultation with the DBM, will have to study and propose measures for the provision of social assistance to qualified barangay officials and functionaries, as well as identify funding sources

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By NewsDesk   @bactiman63
Sri Lankan health officials have reportedly taken steps to introduce Wolbachia bacteria into the environment starting in February.
The pilot project is to be carried out in Colombo and Nugegoda. Bacteria are to be released in 25 Grama Niladhari Divisions around Colombo, Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Health Dr. Paba Palihawadana said revealed at a media briefing in Colombo Saturday.
The bacteria will be introduced after years of laboratory testing and field testing.
The bacteria is being used successfully in 12 countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, the Pacific Islands, Vietnam, India, and Mexico.
Government officials say Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes are bred and in partnership with local communities, released them into areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases.When Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry Wolbachia, the bacteria competes with viruses like dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever reducing the transmission of the virus to the diseases.
Sri Lanka has recorded more than 85,000 dengue fever cases in 2019 to date.

South Africa’s Zozibini Tunzi won the 2019 Miss Universe title.  
The South African stunner was crowned by last year’s winner, Catriona Gray of the Philippines.
“The Palace lauds Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados for representing our country well in the Miss Universe pageant in Atlanta, Georgia, USA,” Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said.
“Ms. Ganados has given pride and glory to the Filipino nation by showcasing the unique beauty and talent of the Filipina.”
The 23-year-old’s “experience in joining the prestigious beauty pageant should add further to her development as a beauty queen,” Panelo noted.
“We wish her all the best in her future endeavors,” the Palace official said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DOTr opens Cavite-Manila ferry route</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade announced that passengers may start using the ferry service from the Cavite City Port Terminal going to the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex in Pasay City, and to the Liwasang Bonifacio Terminal (Plaza Lawton) in Manila, and vice versa.
“Andito kami ngayon dahil hangarin namin na ilunsad at i-revive ang ferry operation ng Cavite. Itong operation ng Cavite ay matagal ding nawala, matagal ding nakalimutan, kaya sabi namin, umpisahan, buhayin, at itaguyod ulit ‘yung ferry operation ng Cavite,” Tugade said.
The transportation chief also announced more good news: the riding public will get to avail of the ferry service for free until 9 January 2020, in coordination with Shogun Ships Co. Inc. and Seaborne Shipping Company Inc.
“Kausap ko ‘yung Shogun, Seaborne, ang sabi ko, ‘itong proyektong ito, gusto ko pamaskong handog sa mga Cavite, dapat ito libre. Hanggang matapos ang Kapaskuhan sa January 9, libre ang pamasahe sa ferry. Ito ‘yung pamaskong handog ng administrasyong Duterte sa inyo,”  Tugade said.
Immediately following the launch, the ferry service kicked off its operations with an inaugural voyage from the Cavite City Port Terminal to the Liwasang Bonifacio Terminal (Lawton) in Manila. Upon arrival, it was announced that passengers who will ride the “MV Island Sabtang” will get free rides until January 31, 2020.
Two vessels will start operating tomorrow, with two to three more to be added next month to serve the routes.  
Through the ferry service, travel time from Cavite City Port Terminal to Liwasang Bonifacio Terminal is estimated at 40 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, travel time between the Cavite City Port Terminal and CCP, and vice versa, is around 15 minutes.
MV Island Sabtang from Shogun Ships Co. Inc. can accommodate 57 passengers, while MB Seaborne Mercury can accommodate 27 passengers. Fares for both rides are still under negotiation, as Secretary Tugade continues to push for lower prices.
For his part, Cavite City Mayor Bernardo Paredes thanked the DOTr and its attached agencies under the maritime sector for initiating the ferry service in a bid to help ease road traffic to and from Metro Manila.
“Sa ngalan ng ating pamahalaan at mamamayan ng ating siyudad, ang inyo pong lingkod ay lubos na nagagalak at nagpapasalamat sa inyong presensya upang matunghayan ang opisyal na pagbubukas ng Cavite-Manila Ferry Service. Ang nasabing proyekto ay makapagbibigay ng alternatibong pamamaraan ng transportasyon na tutugon sa ating kasalukuyang suliranin sa trapiko, na bago tayo makarating sa Metro Manila ay mag-uubos tayo ng mga 2-3 oras, ngayon, mga 40 minutes na lang,” Paredes said.
The Cavite-Manila Ferry Service is an offshoot of the “water jeepney” concept that was developed in Cebu, and was announced during the operational dry run of the Sangley Airport in Cavite. Secretary Tugade hopes that the riding public will utilize the service, as it offers a quick, convenient, and comfortable mode of transportation.
“Binubuhay natin ang konsepto ng ‘water jeepney’ sa Cavite, at sana po tangkilikin ninyo, para masabi natin, ‘okay ka, ferry ko’,” Tugade added.
Aside from the ferry service, the DOTr and MARINA also launched high priority maritime-related projects, such as the registration of recreational boats to boost tourism, and the opening of the MARINA Central Office Processing Center at the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange for the benefit of Filipino seafarers.  
Regular fare for Manila-Cavite City is P160, P128  for students, P114 for seniors and PWDs, and P80 for children below 4 years old.  While Manila-CCP Complex will be P200 for regular passenger, P180 for students, P143 for seniors and PWDs, and P128 for children below 4 years old.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fans react as Philip Schofield shares video of Holly Willoughby amid feud</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans have reacted to Philip Schofield’s most recent tweet, as the presenter shared a video of himself and Holly Willoughby amid rumours of a day time TV “civil war.”
According to claims, a number of ITV staff have complained about Philip within the organisation.
Phillip has ignored rumours of potential feuds in order to share the video, which shares the news that he and Holly are up for a Telly Talks award.
The Sun claims that This Morning’s Friday presenter Ruth Langsford has made an official complaint against Philip.
They also allege that Holly’s relationship with Philip has become strained in recent months.
Reports claim that Holly felt embarrassed by Philip’s social media behaviors.
A source told The Sun said: “Holly felt it was inappropriate that Phillip was posting videos of her on social media drinking shots of alcohol, but felt too nervous to speak to him directly about it.”
‘So someone at their agents YMU spoke to Phillip who accepted Holly’s decision. But it just shows things can become strained between them. But they find a way to work it out.’
Philip has apparently ignored the rift rumours in sharing the tweet, and fans are not happy.
“Not even an explanation or an apology for his biased unprofessional behavior. He needs sacking,” said one follower.
“Any response to the outcry? Are you not ashamed?,” said another.
However, some shared their support for the presenter.
One fan wrote: “People dont know him. Who knows what the truth is. I think people need to concentrate on their own life before talking about someone else when they have no idea what the truth is. Leave the poor bloke alone.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Some online speculation about Trevor Deely's disappearance is "outrageous", sister says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The sister of Trevor Deely has said some of the online speculation about her brother's disappearance is "outrageous" and needs to be toned down "several notches".
22-year-old Trevor went missing from Dublin city centre on December 7th 2000.
He was last seen on CCTV in the early hours of the morning after attending a work Christmas party.
Over the weekend, gardaí issued a fresh appeal for information on the 19th anniversary of Trevor's disappearance - saying that even the smallest piece of information may assist the investigation.
Speaking on the Pat Kenny Show today, Trevor's sister Michele says the family has kept trying different ways to find Trevor but they keep 'coming up blank'.
She observed: "We've done a huge amount of work... but all that work, in a way, is coming to haunt us - it's really becoming a very difficult item for the family when we think about speculation."
Michele said speculation does happen in the media, but it's "rare" - suggesting that it's the online speculation that needs to "come down several notches".
She observed: "You'd want to read what people write online - it is outrageous.
"At some stage I do think there has [...] something - I don't if it's a ruling or something [like that] - that doesn't allow that occur.
She added: "There's lots of theories - [like] Trevor went to Alaska, got caught up in something and somebody followed him back and did something to him.
"He was a simple guy... he was an entry level IT worker. And [yet] people have him caught up in this banking scam... [or] that he was involved in some crazy scheme, and that's why he was taken. It's crazy."
Michele added that she's been rejected by multiple social media companies when she's brought the concerns to them.
She told Pat: "I battle a lot to get the right facts out there, but it's actually really difficult."
Michele said there have been 'hundreds, if not thousands' of potential witnesses with potential sightings over the years.
She explained: "You never know when you're going to get a story that actually is true... and it could be the worst thing ever.
"Trevor would never give up on us - that's our commitment. As difficult as it is to deal with the speculation... we won't give up. We have to keep fighting through it until we find him."
CCTV footage, which you can see below, shows the last known movements of Trevor Deely.
Footage of the rear entrance of the premises at 3:35am shows an unknown man talking with Trevor at the back gate.
This man has never been identified.
Trevor was last seen on CCTV passing the since-removed Bank of Ireland ATM on Haddington Road at 4.14am.
Around 30 seconds later, a man was captured on CCTV walking in the same direction as Trevor.
Gardaí at Pearse Street Garda station are appealing for any information that could assist the investigation into Trevor's disappearance.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Pearse Street Garda station on 01-666-9000, the Garda Confidential Line at 1800-666-111 or Crimestoppers on 1800-250-025.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Senator Bong Go, MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim, Department of Transportation (DOTr)  Secretary Arthur Tugade, Department of Environment Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Roy Cimatu and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno were present during the ceremony at 10 a.m.
“The Pasig River ferry service has been an alternative mode of transport for Metro Manila commuters who want to avoid the busy streets of Metro Manila. They can enjoy ferry rides between Pasig City and Manila for free until the end of January ,” said Lim.
“With the government’s collective effort and President Duterte’s order, Pasig River is now clean from floating garbage so aside from the ferry service being an alternative mode of transport, commuters can now enjoy the beauty of the river while on cruise,” Go added.
Go encouraged the concerned government officials to find ways and source funds for it to be free until the end of 2020.  He added that the renewed beauty of the 25-kilometer river will attract more ferry service passengers.
According to Lim, the free ferry transportation program hopes to encourage the public to patronize the ferry service over public utility vehicles and avoid the hassles of commuting in congested Metro Manila roads. Commuters will be accommodated on a first-come, first-served basis.
In preparation for the re-launch, Lim ordered the refurbishment of ferry stations and the sourcing of additional boats to further serve passengers better.
Lim also thanked the local chief executives of Metro Manila for their support to the project, especially Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto who provided two newly procured ferry boats which are now part of the PRFS fleet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Isko wants Manila to end ‘endo’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In his speech at yesterday’s regular flag-raising ceremony in City Hall, Moreno said he would want to make Manila ‘the number one implementor with regard the government campaign to finish ‘endo.’
The mayor said he has already promoted about 500 employees since he assumed mayorship on June 30, adding that it had been the city govenment’s policy to give priority to JOs or ‘job order personnel’ so they can become permanent employees.
‘Pag pinipirmahan ko appointment, di ako nagkakaroon ng kwentada sa kaisipan.  Sa loob ng limang buwan, naging polisiya ko nang bigyang prayoridad ang mga JO na maging permanent.  Halos inaabot ako ng madaling araw sa pagpirma,’ Moreno said.
Stressing he wants to provide certainty and security in the minds of JO personnel, Moreno cited a case where the JO was found to have been serving for 27 years already.
‘Ibig sabihin, 54 times na siyang nagpapapirma ng  papel. Ganun din, 54 times na siyang nangamba. Imagine that kind of life, that kind of emotion,’ he said.
Moreno assured the city employees that he will be fair in the manner of promotion, citing length of service and  if the applicant is qualified as the top considerations.
JOs are similarly-situated with contractual employes in private companies in that their employment is good for only six months subject to renewal if their services are still needed. ‘Endo’ refers to end of contract.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was learned that the BI has entered into a memorandum of agreement with the service provider for the pilot testing of the e-gates, initially at the NAIA 2 immigration departure area.
Bi spokesperson Dana Sandoval said the e-gate system was implemented last year in the immigration arrival areas of NAIA’s three terminals and the international airports in Mactan-Cebu, Davao, and Clark.
The noticeable drop in incidence of long queues at the airports has been attributed to the successful implementation of the project, she said, adding that just like in the case of e-gates installed at the immigration arrival areas, the new lanes shall cater only to departing OFWs in order to ensure smoother and faster processing for these Filipinos in recognition of their contributions to the country’s economic development.
BI port operations division chief Grifton Medina, said the project’s pilot testing and demonstration would last for six months and that the BI is targeting to process at least  100,000 passengers before the project could become fully operational.
Medina said the project’s entire cost will be shouldered by the company that supplied the country’s e-gates.
Medina added that the service provider has committed to initially install and operate two e-gates and biometric machines at NAIA’s Terminal 2 for exclusive use of departing overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and airline crew of Philippine Airlines (PAL).

Talking to the media in Sialkot on Sunday, she said that what an irony it is that Opposition leaders are devising a policy to protect their corruption, while sitting in London.
The special assistant said that first former prime minister Nawaz Sharif refuted the ownership of his London apartments and now he is presiding over party meeting there, adding that the law and courts were summoning them but the Sicilian Mafia is refusing to return to Pakistan.
Dr Firdous said wrong economic policies of the PML-N government had ruined Pakistan s economy and now the PTI government is taking coarse correction, adding that the paper companies of PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif inflicted a loss of billions of rupees on country s economy.
“They cannot befool the people of Pakistan anymore,” she added.
Firdous urged the opposition, especially the PML-N, to come to the parliament to discuss and solve the problems being faced by the common man.
“The government is committed to resolve people s problems under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan,” the special assistant said and added Imran Khan is striving hard to take the country to new heights of progress and development.
She said improved economic indicators show that the economy is progressing on the right path.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Freeland heads to Mexico in effort to finalize new NAFTA revisions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA — Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland is to meet American and Mexican officials in Mexico City on Tuesday amid reports a deal to revise the new North American free-trade agreement is close to completion.
The federal government revealed Freeland's itinerary late Monday following a day of furious speculation about the state of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal — and concerns from Canada's aluminum sector about what the agreement could mean for the industry and workers.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump talked directly about the deal Monday, Trudeau's office reported, without details.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement was signed by the three countries last year, but U.S. ratification has been stalled for months as congressional Democrats and organized labour have bickered with Mexico over labour rights as well as the agreement's treatment of steel and aluminum.
There were concerns the agreement, which aims to update the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, would not be approved before Congress disperses until 2020 and its focus shifts to next fall's presidential election.
Freeland was cautious Monday amid chatter of an imminent deal.
"In the lives of ordinary Canadians, there is perhaps no issue in our relationship with the United States that matters more than trade," she said in question period.
"The prime minister raised the ratification of the new NAFTA and other trade issues in his meeting last week with the president and we have been working intensively, including many conversations over the weekend and this morning with our American partners, on getting the deal finalized."
Trump weighed in Monday, saying: "I'm hearing very good things, including from unions and others that it’s looking good. I hope they put it up to a vote, and if they put it up to a vote, it’s going to pass.
"I'm hearing a lot of strides have been made over the last 24 hours, with unions and others."
The breakthrough appears to have followed Mexico accepting — with a five-year phase-in period — a U.S. demand to tighten the definition of North American steel in a section of the agreement dealing with where cars and their parts can be said to originate.
Products that officially originate in North America get more favourable treatment than ones that originate abroad but come through one of the countries in the agreement.
However, Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his country would not accept the same tighter definition for aluminum because the raw materials are not produced in Mexico.
Mexico also rejected U.S. demands for American inspectors to be sent in to ensure Mexican auto workers are being paid $16 per hour on average, though U.S. officials were said to have accepted Mexico's offer to allow dispute-resolution panels to review labour-law compliance.
Labour unions in the U.S. were to be briefed on the proposed amendments on Monday with the hope they would agree to the changes, which would pave the way for the Democratic leaders to offer their own approval.
The Trump administration as well as the Canadian and Mexican governments would then be asked to agree formally to the amended deal before introducing legislation to put it into force.
Details of the amendments had yet to be communicated to Canadian industry and labour groups Monday, but those representing the aluminum sector and its workers were upset the deal may not include a tighter definition on what constitutes North American aluminum.
"We're certainly not happy with this at all because it simply means Mexico wants to keep an open door to foreign metal coming in from China, from the Middle East, from India," said Aluminum Association of Canada president Jean Simard.
Noting the industry was battered by U.S. tariffs last year, Simard added: "Canada has taken the case of aluminum as much as steel up to now and we certainly expect Minister Freeland and the Canadian government to hold their position on this like they've been doing up to now."
Ken Neumann, national director in Canada of the United Steelworkers union, which represents employees in both the aluminum and steel industries, was also critical of Mexico's demand for a five-year phase-in period for tightening the definition of North American steel.
"We strongly would anticipate or hope that our government is going to stand up for our aluminum workers," he said.
"So we're going to keep our fingers crossed. We're going to consult with the government of Canada to make sure they're going to stand up for what's right for the steel industry and for our aluminum workers."
Neumann and other members of the United Steelworkers' leadership team in Canada were scheduled to fly to the U.S. to be briefed Tuesday on details of the proposed amendments.
"At this stage of the game, all eyes are on where organized labour is on Mexico's newest proposals," said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with law firm Dickinson Wright and an expert in Canada-U.S. trade. "If they agree, it's likely House (of Representatives) Democrats will sign off on this."
Yet while there is a chance that legislation could be introduced this week and passed by Congress before Dec. 20 to bring the deal into force, Ujczo warned there still could be unexpected hurdles.
"Nobody has seen the implementing bill soup-to-nuts," he said. "So we're closing Phase 1 of the deal process, then we're on to Phase 2, which will be we'll all have to take a look at the implementing bill."
The new trade pact would replace NAFTA, which came into force in 1994 and eliminated most tariffs and other trade barriers involving the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Critics, including Trump, labour unions and many Democratic lawmakers, branded NAFTA a job-killer for America because it encouraged factories to move south of the border, capitalize on low-wage Mexican workers and ship products back to the U.S. duty-free.
Mexico ratified the new North American deal in June while the Canadian government has said it is waiting to ratify the agreement at the same time as the United States.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jowie Irungu, the prime suspect in the brutal murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani has allegedly been transferred from Kamiti Maximum Prison Security Prison under unclear circumstances.
According to Nation, the family of Irungu learnt of his transfer very late on Friday, December 6 and could not confirm it as the prison only allowed visits during the weekdays.
They therefore had to wait until Monday, December 9, where they were told that he had been transferred on Friday.
His mother, Anastacia stated that upon visiting the prison, the officer in charge said that he had been transferred to Manyani Maximum Security Prison in Voi, Taita Taveta County.

According to the mother, he was allegedly moved on Friday, an action that has left the family confused over the motive behind it, as they claim they were not aware of such development.
Anastacia has also stated that the family lawyer representing Jowie denied being aware of the transfer, despite the prison authorities insisting that it was a normal transfer.
“The prison officer says it’s a normal transfer but our lawyer says he has never heard of something like that. He has been taken to Manyani and his next appearance in court is in February. It’s like they want to do something to him,” said the devastated mother.
The publication also made it clear that Irungu’s lead lawyer, Hassan Nandwa, stated that there were no applications for his transfer hence raising more questions on the alleged transfer.

Additionally, an account by the mother through the publication indicated that some warders of the prison were puzzled after they were questioned on the details of how a prisoner in remand would be transferred.
It is expected that a person who has been convicted and sentenced to get transfers from one prison to the other as the case of routine, however, in the case of a detainee whose case is still pending raises more alarm.
Irungu’s parents on Monday, December 9, made efforts to get to him by boarding a bus that was headed to Voi, with efforts by the local daily to speak to the Commissioner-General of Kenya Prisons proving futile.

“We have to see if he is okay and if indeed he is there,” said the mother.
Jowie has been held in solitary confinement following the pending case of the murder of Monica Kimani through orders directed by the High Court.
His bail application is set to be ruled over on February 13, 2020 hence expected to spend another Christmas in remand.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jail Warden Chief Insp. Ricky Heart Pegalan said SJ01 Virgilio Obispo was conducting a routine inspection at around 1 a.m. outside the premises of the city jail when he noticed a man trying to sneak in a red plastic bag inside the two-story facility which served as jail extension.
The unidentified man immediately ran away, leaving the red plastic bag hanging from the steel grills of the extension facility, prompting Obispo to grab the bag and bring it to the duty desk officer.
When jail duty officer Insp. Mark Jerome Cagurungan checked the contents of the bag, it yielded 11 rims of Mighty cigarettes, two packs of Marlboro red, two mobile phones, two head set and cellular phone charger wrapped in brown packaging tape.
Pegalan, a lawyer, said those who wanted to sneak contraband inside the jail facility will be facing jail time if they will be caught red handed.
He added that they will continue to adhere to the directives and policies issued by Regional Director of the Jail Bureau Jail Chief Supt. Ignacio Panti to fulfill its objective of zero contraband inside jail facility through intensified roving inspection and installation of preventive measures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Doug Ford goes back to the well on water bottling ban</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ontario’s moratorium on new permits to bottle water will be extended for nine months.
Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks Jeff Yurek “proposed” the extension on November 19. Just weeks earlier, he had signalled through the media his government's intention to allow the moratorium imposed by the previous Liberal to expire at the end of the year. 
Now his government is accepting further public input until December 18 “to verify the extensive data and scientific evidence submitted already,” according to a government spokesperson.
Nestlé Waters Canada, which has been at the centre of ongoing controversy over efforts to renew its water bottling permits at wells in Hillsburgh and Aberfoyle in Wellington County west of Toronto, has expressed support for the extension. A company spokesperson told the CBC that the company welcomes the opportunity to "demonstrate [its] commitment to the responsible stewardship of Ontario's freshwater resources."
Yurek’s change of position is essential. But there’s still a long way to go to protect water as a common good in Ontario. In fact, the Ford government is in the midst of weakening environmental protections through Bill 132. The so-called Better for People, Smarter for Business Act, has passed second reading in the Legislature. 
So why the reversal on water bottling permits? The government could be just stalling for time.
Persistent public opposition to Nestlé’s water bottling operations in Wellington County has reached a boiling point with the threat of future water shortages in the region linked to Nestle’s expansion efforts in the region. Nestlé Waters Canada currently has permission to extract 4.7 million litres of water a day at wells in Hillsburgh and Aberfoyle. 
Also, preliminary results of a water study in Centre Wellington – site of Nestlé’s proposed Middlebrook well – indicates that the community is “at risk of not having enough water to service its growing population,” according to Martin Keller of the Grand River Conservation Authority.
Moreover, scientific studies show that pumping at this well will interfere with the township being able to expand its water system. 
At the same time, the Ford government has stated it’s keen to see more housing development in the community. So why would the government approve a new well for Nestlé? (It would add only one or two jobs.)
In the weeks before Yurek’s announcement, more than 500 people attended events in four different cities to draw public attention to Nestlé's operations. Tens of thousands of people have signed petitions sponsored by Environmental Defence and the Council of Canadians calling for a permanent moratorium on water takings in the province. 
The groups warn that weakening water protections could put the public at risk as happened at Walkerton under Mike Harris.
Harris was premier in Ontario in 2000 when an outbreak of waterborne gastroenteritis in the town just 100 kilometres northwest of Guelph, sickened more than 2,000 people and resulted in six deaths. The government ignored the warnings.
For the Ford government, the stakes are just as high as the growing climate crisis increases the pressure on drinking water supply, making the future of Nestlé and the rest of the bottled water industry less tenable.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Feds charge Volkswagen with violating environment law for faking emissions tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA — German auto giant Volkswagen appears ready to strike a plea deal with Canada after being charged Monday for allegedly importing cars into this country that company executives knew violated emissions standards.
Environment and Climate Change Canada announced the company had been charged with 60 violations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. All but two of the charges related to the 128,000 vehicles imported into Canada between 2008 and 2015 that had illegal emissions.
The other two charges are for providing false information.
Canada's case against Volkswagen comes more than four years after the company admitted to installing software on 11 million cars worldwide to trick emissions-testing equipment into concluding the cars ran more cleanly than they actually did.
The company issued a statement saying it has co-operated fully with Canadian investigators and that a deal is prepared ahead of the company's first court appearance in Toronto on Friday.
"At the hearing, the parties will submit for the court's consideration a proposed plea resolution and seek its approval," the statement said. "The details of the proposed plea resolution will be presented at the hearing."
Environment Canada officials published notice of the charges Monday, but said they won't comment further because the matter is before the courts.
Environment Canada's investigation, launched in September 2015, was repeatedly criticized by environmental experts and lawyers for taking too long.
The company pleaded guilty in U.S. court in 2017 for violating American laws and was fined $4.3 billion. In 2018, German prosecutors fined the company one-billion euros for the emissions cheating case, which some dubbed "dieselgate" because it involved Volkswagen's diesel engines.
Several Volkswagen executives and managers involved in the deception were charged in the U.S. and Germany, and some have already been sent to prison.
In total, the elaborate scheme has cost the company more than US$30 billion in legal fines and civic lawsuits as well as compensation to customers who returned the affected cars for refunds or exchanges.
The culprit software, known as a defeat device, is illegal under Canadian law.
Most cars are tested for emissions in labs and the software allowed vehicles to produce lower emissions while in testing mode than when driven normally. The emissions were allegedly 35 times above Canadian legal limits.
Muhannad Malas, toxics program manager at Canadian advocacy group Environmental Defence, said it is frustrating how long the charges took, but is pleased to see them nonetheless.
Canadian law allows for fines of up to $1 million for each day an offence continues, but Malas hopes whatever agreement is reached has the right effect.
"The levy or the fines collected have to respond to the massive scale of this environmental crime," he said.
The affected cars in Canada included 3.0-litre and 2.0-litre diesel engine vehicles sold under Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brands
A 2016 Health Canada study estimated 320 Canadians died prematurely in 2015 because of illnesses related to inhaling diesel exhaust from on-road vehicles. The number of premature deaths more than doubled to 710 when combining on-road and off-road sources of diesel emissions, such as diesel burned for electricity.
Nitrous oxide, ozone and small particulate matter are the main causes of cancers, and respiratory illnesses bronchitis and asthma.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Muslim Waqf Chips Away at Temple Mount Increasing Pressure on Retaining Walls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Islamic Waqf announced on Sunday that renovation work has been resumed at the Al Marwani mosque, otherwise known as Solomon’s Stables, in the Temple Mount. The Waqf has assumed custodianship over the holy site and often into making illegal unilateral decisions the mount.Renovation work on the 600 square yard complex lies in stark contrast to the status quo on the Temple Mount.
This development comes shortly after the opening of the Gate of Mercy. Many are concerned that the renovation is happening without the supervision of the Israeli Antiquities Authority.
Solomon’s Stables are an underground vaulted space that is now used by local Muslims for prayer. The area is at the bottom of a set of stairs that leads down from the al-Aqsa Mosque, underneath the Temple Mount, to the base of the southern wall of the Mount. Solomon’s Stables are situated 12.5 m (41 ft) underneath the courtyard on the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount. The enclave features twelve rows of pillars and arches. Back in 1996, the Waqf converted the space into a prayer area. They did this by installing lights and floor tiles which compromised the integrity of the structure’s walls.
The structure is believed to have been constructed by King Herod as an extension of the platform of the Temple Mount southward onto the Ophel. Herod’s engineers built the massive platform above the slopes of the Temple Mount. They did this by erecting a substructure that consisted of a series of vaulted arches to reduce pressure on the retaining walls. The vaults are supported by 88 pillars resting on enormous Herodian blocks and divided into 12 rows of galleries”, were originally storage spaces for the Second Temple. Tourists are rarely ever allowed to enter the spaces with Herodian finishes.
By and large, the underground space remained empty with the exception of the Crusader rule over Jerusalem. The Crusaders transitioned it into a stable for their cavalry. The rings for tethering horses can still remain on several of the pillars -hence the term ‘Solomon’s Stables’.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pound Sterling hits Fresh 31-Month High vs. Euro on Survation Poll</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Poll shows 14 point lead for Conservatives
- Odds for Con. majority surge to 80%
- Sterling rally extends
- Late Labour surge looking increasingly unlikely
The British Pound hit a fresh 31-month high against the Euro Monday after two polls showed gains for the Conservative Party and losses for Labour, confirming expectations that the party of Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains on track to secure a majority.
A BMG poll for the Independent showed the Conservatives up two points to 41% and Labour down 1 point to 32%.
A poll out from Survation for ITV's Good Morning Britain show had the Conservatives up 2 points to 45% and Labour down 2 points to 31%.
"As is normal as an election date draws closer, the level of respondents we interviewed who said they were undecided this week’s poll was 12%, down from 17% last week - and so some of the movement we are seeing in this week’s polling may be driven by the public, having seen the various TV debates and manifesto launches simply making their minds up," says Survation, in a briefing on their latest poll findings.
On the Conservative Party's ongoing strength, Survation says, "the Conservative party has increased support to some extent in this polling amongst both Leave and Remain voters."
Any lead of over 7 points suggests an outright majority, while a lead of 14 points would signify something close to a landslide. "GBP is rallying again after markets all but fully discount a good Tory majority, ignoring the high number of undecided voters – Friday will show whether that was a good strategy or not," says Elsa Lignos, Global Head of FX Strategy with RBC Capital Markets.
The polls suggest a Sterling-friendly trend remains in place with just four days to go until what is being billed as the most important election of a generation: the Pound-to-Euro exchange rate rose to its highest level since May 2017 when it reached 1.1893 on Monday. The Pound-to-Dollar exchange rate on the other hand is quoted at 1.3160, just below last week's 7-month highs at 1.3162.
"Judging from recent polls, the most likely scenario is the Conservative party win majority government. If this scenario pans out, GBP/USD can edge higher towards 1.3500 over the next few weeks as the UK would be on the way towards an orderly Brexit on 31 January 2020," says Kim Mundy, a foreign exchange strategist with CBA.

Survation's equivalent poll in the 2017 election, released four days before polling day, showed the Conservative lead down to just one point, making Survation the most accurate pollster in the 2017 election.
This is Survation's final poll for Good Morning Britain but it will be releasing further polls for other clients it has been confirmed.
Perhaps the most significant aspect of polling over recent days is a confirmation that Labour's recent attack on the Conservative's lead has stalled, ensuring the gap between the two parties is wide enough to allow the Conservatives a majority. In 2017 the rise in Labour's vote share proved relentless, such that by the time of the vote they were able to close the gap to just two points. Foreign exchange markets have been on alert for a repeat of this performance in 2019, but with just four days to go until the vote and only three days in which to campaign, the closing of this gap by Labour looks to be a remote prospect.
A host of polls released at the weekend pout the Conservative lead at between 9 and 10 points.
The implied odds of a Conservative majority with the bookmakers has surged to a fresh campaign high of 80% on Monday, according to the Betfair Exchange. Last Friday saw odds sitting at 72.5%, while the start of the previous week saw odds closer to 65%.
"Bookies odds show a Tory majority as a near certainty, in line with the steady gap in most (but not all) opinion polls. But there is a historically high number of undecided voters which could affect as many as 80 marginal seats. We will be neutral GBP going into Thursday and look to trade the outcome," says Lignos.
The steady rise in the odds for a Conservative majority has coincided with a broad-based rally in the value of Sterling as markets continue to see a majority win for the Conservatives as being the most market-friendly outcome. "Polls continue to show the Conservatives on course for a majority government after Thursday's UK election, which would end the Brexit uncertainty and prove the most favourable outcome for GBP," says Richard Pace, an options analyst with Thomson Reuters.

Various news sources are reporting Monday that Johnson will close his campaign in north England, where he will tour marginal seats in Labour’s 'heartlands' where he believes his message of delivering Brexit will strike a chord with jaded Labour voters. 
Johnson will warn voters that they face a “great betrayal” under Jeremy Corbyn as he says that Labour MPs won their seats on a "false prospectus" of securing Brexit but subsequently "stuck two fingers up to the public".
The Telegraph reports Johnson will visit every region of England and Wales to tell voters "that their instruction to leave the EU will be reversed by Islington-based Labour politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes”.
Labour will meanwhile attempt to steer the conversation away from Brexit and back on to the economy by announcing they would begin renationalising rail, mail and utilities within the first 100 days of a Corbyn administration.
Looking ahead, YouGov will release their final MRP projection on Tuesday. This is where YouGov take their most recent polling datasets and translate them into seat numbers. 
"The MRP poll from YouGov seemed to more accurately predict the result of the 2017 election than any of its competitors, which is why the results of such a survey a few weeks ago caused a stir when it predicted a Conservative majority. However, that was relatively early in the campaign, so tomorrow night’s update from YouGov will be watched closely to see whether it shows any change in voting intentions as the day approaches," says Rhys Herbert, an economist with Lloyds Bank.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bigg Boss 13: Himanshi Khurana Finally SPEAKS About Her Relationship With Asim Riaz</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week’s weekend ka vaar at Bigg Boss 13 house made some big revelations and host Salman Khan lost his cool not once but twice. This weekend Salman revealed some secrets about Arhaan Khan to Rashami Desai and the whole nation went crazy and started the hashtag #StayStrongRashami. This week eviction was Himanshi Khurana.
Asim Riaz has been very vocal about his feelings for Himanshi Khurana. But Himanshi revealed that she’s already in a relationship with someone but can’t reveal him on national television. In an interview with Pinkvilla Himanshi spoke about her equation with Asim and told that they are just good friends and nothing more.
Talking about where she stands with Asim, Himanshi said, “In majority, I feel happy that people loved us inside. At least, they understand that I was clear in my point and he was clear in his. He and I are very good friends. It takes guts to say what he said on the show knowing that I can’t cross my limits. There are so many friends who might end up liking you but not necessary that they have the wrong motive behind it.”
Bigg Boss 13 is extended by five weeks because of the enormous response show has been getting. We can’t wait to see who takes the Bigg Boss 13 trophy home this time.
Tell us in the comments section below, who do you think will win the show.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The rise and rise of the first African-American woman distiller and operator of a nationally distributed vodka</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For almost six years since she released Black Momma Vodka, Vanessa Braxton has been a major force in the spirit industry in the United States.
In 2013 when she introduced her ultra-premium vodka brand, she made history as the first African-American woman owner and operator of a nationally distributed vodka.
She is also the founder of the country’s first black-owned tea and beverage plant. At the moment, her vodka brand is a favorite of many vodka lovers in the country.
Having started making teas in 2016, the 50-year-old has so far made business transactions with over 33,000 online and wholesale customers and has made almost $3 million in sales.
Last month, she made headlines again when she announced that she would be taking over three storefronts in a New York shopping plaza to open Black Momma Tea & Café.
When opened in 2020, the restaurant will serve about 160 different blends of tea, three flavored agaves as well as other organic and vegan food products.
And the Black Momma Vodka CEO is all geared up for her new venture.
With a huge experience in the government and corporate industry, Braxton, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, earned a bachelor of science degree in construction management and engineering from Pratt Institute in New York.
She then went through the executive program in negotiation at Harvard Law School and consortium with MIT.
Braxton subsequently started a career in corporate and government industries where she managed construction and engineering contracts worth over $350 million for the New York State government, reports Black Enterprise.
But while in college, Braxton was already selling drinks to her colleagues after having obtained a liquor license. This will push her to start Black Momma Vodka after retiring from her corporate and government work.
Black Momma Vodka is “distilled five times and filtered five times from corn for its signature smooth taste. It’s distilled through Crushed Diamond Lava Rocks and fused with Cascade Mountain Spring Water from Oregon,” according to its website.
In 2014, vodka lovers in over 30 states enjoyed selections that included a Green Tea, Pomegranate Tea, Chai Tea, Peach Tea, and Sour Sop Tea. 
Braxton said at the time: “I am the only one that is doing teas, period. Not flavored, all natural. People are more health conscious of what they put into their bodies. I know I am.”
“People want something that is new, different and also as close as possible to natural to pair with their food.” 
Since then, the mother of three has carved a niche for herself in the spirit industry and she now has a host of clients, including the Marine Corps MWR, US Embassy in Moscow, US Embassy of Columbia, US Embassy of Libya & the American Embassy of Lome.
Her next year’s 4,600-square-foot cafe and bar in Wheatley Heights, New York will serve as her company’s headquarters and training facility for her 300 franchisees who are ready to work with her.
Featuring food items such as wraps and muffins as well as drinks from other local businesses, the cafe will have meeting rooms for members of the community, and Braxton is hoping to partner with companies such as Microsoft for free classes, reports Newsday.
Having people from her background at heart, the retired structural engineer said she chose Wheatley Heights for her café because out of about 5,100 residents, more than 60 percent are black and Latino.
“I have plenty of places I could go,” said Braxton. “But I wanted to take the opportunity for people who look like me to see what I’m doing for the community so that they can step up and do the same thing.”
“I’m using a lot of small, minority, women and veteran-owned vendors, who never had the chance with larger places,” she said. “It’s economic inclusion for everyone.”
Braxton is one of the few black females making it big in the male-dominated spirits industry despite the challenges.
Recently, Fawn Weaver, who is the first female colored person to run a major whiskey brand, opened a new whiskey distillery in honor of Nearest Green, the enslaved African American who taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey.
Author and entrepreneur Weaver met with Nathan ‘Nearest’ Green’s descendants, who gave her the permission to put his name on a bottle and start the Uncle Nearest whiskey company.
It is her way of honoring the man known as the Godfather of Tennesee whiskey and leading a movement to ensure that his whiskey legacy lives on for generations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barack and Michelle Obama Just Bought a Beachfront Mansion on Martha’s Vineyard</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are two of the latest residents of Martha’s Vineyard, which is located off the coast of Massachusetts.
According to the Vineyard Gazette, the couple dropped $11.75 million after the asking price was originally $14.85 million.
The nearly 7,000 square foot home, which sits on 29 acres, has seven bedrooms, eight and a half baths, an outdoor swimming pool, a boathouse, sun decks and balconies, a number of stone fireplaces, as well as its own private view of the ocean. It’s also located in Edgartown, Mass., next to the Edgartown Great Pond.
On Wednesday, the house was sold by Wycliffe Grousbeck — who owns the Boston Celtics — and Corinne Basler Grousbeck, and purchased through a trust.
Reportedly, the former first family vacationed on Martha’s Vineyard in previous summers, and they rented the mansion before they bought it. The beloved couple also both attended Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and possibly became familiar with the vacation area a long time ago.
And their eldest daughter Malia Obama is currently an undergrad student at Harvard University, so the state of Massachusetts has clearly been a major part of the Obamas’ life.
A few photos of the mansion have already hit the internet, which show a huge kitchen with wooden floors and white walls.
Plus, a dining area can be seen with large windows all around it, and there’s an incredibly spacious living room that shows how high the ceiling is and a separate lounge area with its own view of the ocean can be seen too.
Neither the Obamas or the listing agents, Gerret Conover and Thomas LeClair of LandVest Martha’s Vineyard, have spoken about the purchase. Nor have the Grousbecks.
Martha’s Vineyard is known as a popular destination area for the well-off.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grave danger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAYING that inexperienced motorcycle taxis with no track record will put commuters’ lives in danger, the Lawyers for Commuter Safety and Protection (LCSP) filed a petition for injunction with application for a temporary restraining order against five motorcycle taxi companies hoping to penetrate the market.
“The commuting public should not be used as guinea pigs by fly-by-night motorcycle taxi operators with zero track record,” said Atty. Ariel Inton of  LCSP who, together with Atty. Raymond Fortun,  filed the petition.
In a press briefing held yesterday, Inton, speaking in behalf of LCSP, said that the commuter safety advocates filed the petition against We Move Things Philippines Inc. (Joyride), Habal Rides Corp., I-Sabay, Sampa-Dala Corp., and Trans-Serve Corp. The petition stated that their operations are unauthorized and may cause grave and substantial damage to the public.
Inton, a former Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) member, said that the LCSP’s main thrust is to promote commuter safety and uphold the rights of commuters, road users and pedestrians to a safe Mode of  transportation. As such, Inton stated, it has an absolute right to prevent respondents from organizing its fleet of motorcycles for hire and avert its operations which prejudice the riding public.
“The respondents are currently sabotaging the government’s pilot program for motorcycle taxis by unilaterally according to themselves the privilege to operate motorcycles for hire in the guise of addressing the traffic situation in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and other urban cities,” Inton stressed.
“At the outset, it should be pointed out that respondents commenced the roll-out of their motorcycle taxi business without any franchise from Congress or permit nor authority from the Department of Transportation (DOTr),” he added.
According to the petition letter that the LCSP submitted to the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City Tuesday, December 3, “Combined, thousands of motorcycles illegally booking and transporting passengers ply the roads, unduly exposing petitioners’ members to road hazards and increased risk of accidents.”
Inton stressed that motorcycle taxi operations are being conducted outside of the pilot program of the DoTr, defeating entirely the essence of the ongoing pilot testing and exposing the riding public to grave risks.
“Di puwedeng ikumpara ang motorcycle taxi sa milk tea na nang mauso ay ang dami nang nagsulputan kahit na mababa ang kalidad. Pero higit na mapanganib kung motorcycle taxi ang pinag-uusapan dahil buhay ng pasahero, buhay ng tao ang malalalagay sa peligro kung papayagan ang mga walang experience at walang track record na motorcycle taxi na makapasada,” said Inton.
“We have requested an immediate restraining order to prevent grave and irreparable damage to the riding public in general, and to the pilot program in particular,” stressed Atty. Raymond Fortun of LCSP. “Moreover, any accident during this critical period will also sabotage the pilot program,” he added.
Early this year, the House of Representatives passed Resolution No. 2449 urging the DoTr to implement a pilot program allowing, monitoring, and regulating the operation of duly registered and organized motorcycles-for-hire as an alternative public transport utility.
The DoTr then instructed various agencies to form a Technical Working Group (TWG) composed of stakeholders and experts from the government and the private sector to discuss issues attendant to the prospect of two-wheel vehicles operating as public transport.
Atty. Inton is also a member of this TWG and participated in the assessment sessions held prior to the recommendation of the pilot run.
The TWG was tasked to identify motorcycle types eligible to be licensed, taking into consideration factors like engine displacement, carrying capacity, operating speeds, routes, seat and helmet requirements, and training requirements for drivers, who will eventually need to obtain a public utility vehicle (PUV) registration.
Upon the recommendation of the TWG, the DoTr allowed the six-month pilot test for motorcycle taxi operations in the Philippines starting in July of this year. Since only the motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas had been established and operating with an eight-month track record at the time, Angkas became the sole subject of the pilot program which will end in December.
The five motorcycle taxi companies which are identified as the respondents in the LCSP petition are neither accredited by the TWG nor part of the pilot program.
“It bears stressing that the pilot program was undertaken precisely in view of the absence of any legal framework currently regulating motorcycle ride-hailing apps,” Fortun declared.
“Its objective is to ‘road test’ the operation of a motorcycle ride-hailing app to enable the government agencies to ascertain the safety and viability of its operations and, more importantly, to allow the agencies to craft the appropriate regulatory framework based on the data that would be gathered during this period of experimentation,” Fortun added.
In turn, Inton stressed that the pilot period, by its very nature, cannot be considered free for all who might want to engage in the same business precisely because of the absence of any law policy regulating the activity. “It will be far too precarious to expose the riding public to the risks of allowing zero-track record entities to operate a motorcycle ride hailing app without the proper regulatory framework yet in place,” he noted.
The five motorcycle taxi companies identified as respondents in the petition were reported to have surfaced and have begun the onboarding of motorcycle bikers and commenced accepting bookings for the transport of passengers.
To date, Joyride has already onboarded 3,000 bikers and have constructed their own office where recruitment is currently done. “These bikers are also at risk of performing an illegal activity considering that Joyride currently does not possess the necessary permit or authority from the DoTr,” the petition states.
In turn, I-Sabay 24/7 and Sampa both make use of an application for drivers and passengers and have started operations already. Transi-Serve Corp. has reportedly begun onboarding efforts as well.
“All of these acts are being done by respondents without having been made part of the Pilot Program for motorcycle taxis,” Inton stressed.  “Their reckless and brazen conduct of pre-empting the government agencies in hopes that they too might eventually be included in the pilot program despite lack of track record and qualifications only prove how the government and the public cannot trust these entities,” he added.
“Untested motorcycle taxi operators, such as respondents, expose commuters to the hazards posed by an unsafe mode of transportation,” Inton declared. “The unwarranted and unauthorized establishment and operation of motorcycle taxi fleet constitutes willful and blatant disregard of the rights of the commuting public in relation to safe modes of public transportation.”
Inton also raised the issue of the TWG continuing to meet without the presence of critical members, which is highly irregular.
“It has also come to my attention that the TWG, in which I am also a member, has been deciding on certain matters without some of its members,” Inton revealed. “Since the start of the pilot run, I have never been invited to meetings and discussions and now I heard that they have been convening, which is not only irregular but rather suspicious and unacceptable,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peaceful Hong Kong march marred by fire outside court, police say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hong Kong: Hong Kong protesters set fire outside court buildings, threw petrol bombs and spray-painted graffiti on government buildings, marring what was otherwise a "generally peaceful" march over the weekend, police said on Monday.
The comments came as protesters called for strikes across the city on Monday. Most railway and transport links ran smoothly during the morning rush hour and there were no initial reports of widespread disruptions.
Vast crowds of black-clad demonstrators thronged the streets of the Asian financial hub on Sunday, in the largest anti-government rally since local elections last month and a resounding show of continued support for the pro-democracy movement.
While the march appeared to be largely peaceful - in marked contrast to other mass demonstrations over the last six months, where protesters fought pitched battles with police - authorities said there was some damage after it ended.
"Although the event was generally peaceful, acts of breaching public peace happened afterwards," police said in a statement on Monday.
"Some rioters spray-painted the exterior walls of the High Court, threw petrol bombs and set fire outside the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, damaging government properties and seriously challenging the spirit of the rule of law," police said, adding that shops and banks were vandalised in the Causeway Bay and Wan Chai areas.
Protesters estimated the turnout at 800,000, while police said 183,000. In an editorial, the official China Daily newspaper called on the Hong Kong government to uphold the rule of law.
"Many residents in Hong Kong are fed up with the violence and disruption that have plagued the city for months," said the newspaper, often used by Beijing to put out its message.
Hong Kong's new police commissioner had said he would take a "hard and soft approach" to the demonstrations, where acts of violence would be treated harshly but other issues more flexibly.
DENIED ENTRY TO MACAU
Two leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong were denied entry over the weekend to the neighbouring Chinese city of Macau, without explanation.
Macau's security chief, Wong Sio Chak, on Monday said security concerns were the only reason for barring entry into the city, broadcaster RTHK reported.
AmCham Chairman Robert Grieves and President Tara Joseph had been traveling to Macau for an annual ball. The pair were told to sign a statement saying they "voluntarily agreed not to pursue entry to Macau".
Wong declined to comment specifically on their cases and said it was speculation that their refusal was linked to Beijing's response to U.S. legislation backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, RTHK said.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, linking the former British colony's special treatment under U.S. law to its autonomy from Beijing.
The unrest in the city of about 7.4 million people started in June as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition to mainland China. It has since morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and sometimes violent protests.
Protesters have set out five demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into alleged police brutality.
China has repeatedly blamed foreign powers, including the United States, for stirring up the unrest.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hong Kong protesters lit a fire outside court buildings, threw petrol bombs and spray-painted graffiti on government buildings, following a “generally peaceful” march at the weekend, police said on Monday.
Protesters called for strikes across the city on Monday, but most railway and transport links ran smoothly during the morning rush hour and there were no reports of widespread disruptions.
Vast crowds of black-clad demonstrators had thronged the streets of the Asian financial hub on Sunday, in the largest anti-government rally since local elections last month and a resounding show of continued support for the pro-democracy movement.
While the march appeared to be largely peaceful – in marked contrast to some other mass demonstrations over the last six months, where protesters fought pitched battles with police – authorities said there was some damage after it ended.
“Although the event was generally peaceful, acts of breaching public peace happened afterwards,” police said in a statement on Monday.
“Some rioters spray-painted the exterior walls of the High Court, threw petrol bombs and set fire outside the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, damaging government properties and seriously challenging the spirit of the rule of law,” police said, adding that shops and banks were vandalized in the Causeway Bay and Wan Chai areas of Hong Kong island.
Reuters reporters at the march on Sunday saw graffiti and protesters setting up barricades, but were not in the vicinity of the other incidents.
The Hong Kong Bar Association condemned what it called “acts of arson and vandalism” and said those responsible must be brought to justice.
Protesters estimated the turnout at 800,000, while police said it was 183,000.
Police said they arrested 42 people over the weekend for rioting, possessing weapons and other charges. Some 6,022 people have now been arrested in relation to the unrest since early June, police said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Never say never again’ says Ruth Davidon on return to politics after stepping down in 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Speaking to The Courier on a recent visit to Angus, Ms Davidson said she missed making the decisions which directed the party, but not all of the other aspects of being the front and centre of Scotland’s second largest party, especially during election times.
The Fife-educated MSP announced she was stepping down earlier this year but has still campaigned at the forefront during the general election campaign – including in Angus where the latest polls suggest there is only 1% separating the SNP candidate Dave Doogan and the Tory’s Kirstene Hair ahead of Thursday’s vote.
Speaking of Ms Hair, she said it was important constituencies had MPs which “emulate the place they live”, adding she was young, articulate and someone who had “taken on the government”.
Having a young child had not shifted her politics, she added, but the Scottish Conservatives had always been a different beast from the main UK party through its history of Liberal Unionism.
Ms Davidson was criticised heavily after she was given a role with Tulchan Communications which would have paid £50,000 for 25 days’ work a year while still an MSP. She has since turned down the job.
When asked if she had plans to return to frontline politics, Ms Davidson said: “Never say never again. And I mean, I’ve been quite clear that I’m going to fulfil my responsibilities to the constituency and also to the party.
“Jen and I have talked before publicly about wanting another child and I think that I certainly wouldn’t be making any long term decisions. You know, obviously I’ll have to get another job – something that’s a bit more normal hours, because even backbench MPs have evening events they’ve got to go to, they’ve got the work weekends, you’re on call tonight.
“I think it’ll be something a bit more normal hours until the kids get to primary school. So, you know, five or six years, I may not want to come back and be desperate to come back.”
Angus Lib Dem candidate Ben Lawrie has written to Ms Hair calling on her to rule out supporting no-deal Brexit.
He said: “You have said you are prepared to sign up to Boris Johnson’s deal, despite his decision to abandon legal commitments to maintain alignment with EU regulation protecting the environment and workers’ rights, and the significant additional burdens it places on businesses trading with the EU. However, given the commitments in your manifesto not to extend the negotiation deadline, it now appears you are also content to see the UK crash out of the EU without a deal. You and I both know that this is unacceptable.
“So, I am asking you to unequivocally reject a no-deal Brexit and to commit to not voting for any plan that would allow the continued risk of such severe economic damage to Angus.
SNP candidate Dave Doogan last week wrote to Labour voters, asking for their vote to help “keep the Tories out” of Angus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Court challenge to federal ban on needles for drug-using prisoners postponed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO - A court hearing to challenge the federal government's ban on needles for drug-using prisoners has been postponed until next week in the latest delay for a case that began seven years ago.
Monday's hearing before the Ontario Superior Court was pushed back to Dec. 17 due to a medical emergency in the applicants' legal team.
The case, launched in 2012 by former prisoner Steven Simons, argues the current rules violate inmates' rights and expose them to serious blood-borne diseases.
Several HIV/AIDS advocacy organizations are also involved in the challenge, saying the federal government must meet its legal obligation to protect the health of people in prison.
“Let me state in the strongest possible terms: prison health is public health,” Simons said outside court Monday.
“Most prisoners in Canada will return home, bringing any illnesses they've contracted in prison with them. A prison needle and syringe program protects all Canadians.”
Simons, who spent more than a decade in a federal penitentiary before his release in 2010, said he tested positive for hepatitis C after another inmate used his injection equipment without his consent or knowledge.
The government has argued in court filings that giving clean drug-injection needles to prisoners would make federal facilities more dangerous, since syringes could be used as weapons.
The Correctional Service last year launched a program that offers inmates in some facilities access to sterile equipment. Lawyers representing the department said Monday the program is currently available in roughly half a dozen prisons, and will eventually be rolled out to all 43 federal facilities.
Applicants in the court challenge are expected to argue that the program, which requires inmates to be approved for participation, infringes on their rights due to its lack of confidentiality.
“Prisoners do not trust it. There is no working program in the world that uses this approach, which operates as a very strong barrier to access,” the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network said in a statement.
“At the same time, the (program) exists only in a handful of prisons and remains vulnerable to cancellation,” the organization said, adding the federal Conservatives have vowed to cancel it if they form government.
However, the judge overseeing the case has asked both sides to discuss whether it should be put on hold until the program has been in place long enough to be evaluated, which could push it back to late next year.
Simons said he hoped the case would not face further delays.
“It puts more prisoners at risk because they're still sharing, so they need to get this moving quickly,” he said outside court.
A hearing was initially scheduled last month, but the case was put over.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- An Ontario court is set to hear today a constitutional challenge to the federal ban on needles for drug-using prisoners.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 51-year-old man will go on trial next year charged with the murder of a 12-year-old boy who was killed in a hit-and-run outside his school in Essex.
Harley Watson died in hospital after a vehicle ploughed into children who were leaving Debden Park High School in Loughton shortly before 3.20pm on December 2.
Terence Glover, of Newmans Lane, Loughton, is charged with his murder and the attempted murder of a woman and nine children.
They are 23-year-old Raquel Jimeno and six boys and three girls aged between 12 and 16 who cannot be named due to a court order.
He wore a green and yellow tracksuit as he appeared before Chelmsford Crown Court.
The defendant remained seated during the nine-minute hearing which was conducted on a video link from Chelmsford Prison, where he is remanded in custody.
He was not asked for pleas during the hearing, and a formal plea hearing was set for January 31 at Chelmsford Crown Court.
A provisional trial date was set for June 1 at Chelmsford Crown Court.
Judge Charles Gratwicke told Glover: “This matter is now adjourned to January 31 2020.
“You are remanded in custody. Thank you very much.”
The defendant replied: “Thank you.”
Harley was described by his family as a “good, kind, helpful and lovely boy”.
In a statement released through Essex Police, they said: “We are so devastated by what has happened.
“We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and concern.
“However as a family we would like people to respect our privacy and allow us to grieve in peace.”
Scores of well-wishers have donated to a GoFundMe.com fundraising page in his memory.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: The uncle of Syrian President Bashar Assad is going on trial in Paris, accused of illegally using Syrian state funds to build a French real estate empire.Rifaat Assad, a former Syrian vice president and brother to longtime leader Hafez Assad, has lived in Europe since his exile from Syria following a failed coup attempt in the 1980s.Watchdog organizations filed a complaint in Paris in 2014 charging that the value of his French real estate holdings — some 90 million euros ($99.5 million) — far exceeds his known income.French authorities have been probing his finances since then, and an investigating judge ordered him earlier this year to stand trial for money laundering.Rifaat Assad denies the charges “completely,” Cedric Anthony-Btesh, a representative of the family, told The Associated Press on Monday.The trial kicks off Monday afternoon. The 82-year-old will not appear in court himself for medical reasons, Anthony-Btesh said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jammu, Dec 09: The Pakistani Army on Saturday violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) at Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian security forces are retaliating to the unprovoked attack befittingly and the shelling is still going on heavily in the area.
According to reports, Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing of small arms and shelling with mortars in Shahpur Sector of J&K's Poonch district.
Ever since the abrogation of Article 370 which granted special status to the now-defunct state of Jammu and Kashmir, there have been 950 incidents of ceasefire violations between August and October in the Valley. The numbers were provided by Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik in Rajya Sabha on Monday.
The minister, however, told the House that every time there has been an unprovoked firing, the Indian Army has always retaliated befittingly to the enemy. Naik also added that all the ceasefire violations have neem taken up with Pakistani administration at appropriate levels.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A young woman was allegedly set on fire by a neighbour after she resisted his attempt to rape her, a police officer said here on Monday.
The 23-year-old victim, who suffered 50 per cent burns in the incident, was currently undergoing treatment at a hospital in the Muzaffarpur town, he said.
Based on a complaint filed by her mother with Ahiyapur police station, the accused has been arrested, Station House Officer (SHO) Vikas Rai said.
According to the complaint, the woman was alone at home on Saturday, when the accused, who lived close by, sneaked into her house and tried to rape her.
Her mother -- who works at a primary health centre -- rushed home and took her to a hospital after a local informed her about the incident, the SHO added.
Saturday's incident comes less than a week after charred bodies of two women, set afire after suspected rape and murder, were found in Buxar and Samastipur districts.
In another village in Ahiyapur police station area, the body of an eight-year-old girl was found on Friday - stuffed in a bag and dumped in an orchard after suspected sexual assault.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beleaguered DR Congo rainforest attacked on all sides</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kisangani, DR Congo: Lush rainforest covers millions of hectares of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a central part of Earth's natural defence against global warming -- but it is under severe threat from a perfect storm of mismanagement and corruption.
An array of global and local NGOs are in a tense fight to save the rainforest, which lost an area twice the size of Luxembourg last year alone, according to Global Forest Watch.
But the problems run right through DR Congo society -- from the poor who rely on charcoal for fuel in a country with meagre supplies of other power, to the senior officials who profit from illegal logging.
"There are lawmakers and soldiers involved. They don't pay taxes -- it's unfair competition," says Felicien Liofo, head of a wood craftsmen's association.
Local police say soldiers simply rip apart the fences around the forest and threaten to shoot anyone who tries to stop them.
NGOs fight back
The government faces a daunting challenge to protect the rainforest.
Its 2002 forestry code imposed a moratorium on new concessions and regulated the number of trees that could be chopped down under existing permits, but officials complain of a lack of resources.
Felicien Malu, a provincial environment coordinator, has roughly 1,200 workers to cover a province twice the size of Portugal.
But his staff, he says, are not paid and lack even the basic tools of their trade -- boats, motorcycles or pickup trucks.
"We can't organise control missions because there are many rivers to cross and unpaved roads," he says.
His predecessor in the job was suspended for embezzlement, underlining how corruption feeds the problem of deforestation.
NGOs have launched a multi-pronged attack against the plunder.
Greenpeace Africa and a coalition of eight NGOs from DRC and neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville have demanded a halt to all industrial activities in the millions of hectares of peatland shared by the two countries.
The ancient wetlands store huge amounts of carbon, but companies are involved in oil exploration, logging and industrial agriculture in the area.
Global Witness investigated the illegal logging trade and earlier this year accused a general in the Congolese army of illegally reselling logging permits.
However, DRC remains impoverished and electricity is a rare luxury, meaning that most Congolese still rely on charcoal as their main fuel supply.
Making charcoal involves chopping down trees and slow-burning the wood in covered ovens -- all of which comes at a steep price for the environment.
"I get through a $30 sackful every two months. That's a fair chunk of what I earn," says Solange Sekera while shopping at a market in the eastern city of Goma. "We have no other means of preparing meals."
'Our forests may disappear'
The trade in charcoal -- known locally as makala -- is worth millions of dollars and it is attracting armed groups to the Goma area, threatening Virunga natural park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas.
More than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) to the west, the reliance on charcoal in Kinshasa is also causing severe problems.
Kinshasa residents consume five million tonnes of wood a year, according to French research group Cirad, and increasing urbanisation is just raising the pressure on the forests.
On the hillsides around the capital, there are scarcely any trees left.
NGOs and the government are once again trying to respond.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is trying to minimise the impact of charcoal burning by introducing "eco makala" ovens that burn the fuel more efficiently and so use less wood.
And President Felix Tshisekedi is trying to boost electricity across the country to reduce demand for wood-based fuel.
He has championed hydroelectric power -- and ground was broken in early October on a new dam in Goma.
NGOs and locals are not convinced of the viability of the project, but Tshisekedi is adamant: "Given the current rate of population growth and our energy needs, our forests may disappear by the year 2100," he says.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Delhi court allows Robert Vadra to travel abroad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Monday allowed Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, to travel abroad for medical treatment and business purposes. Vadra is facing a probe under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, following allegations of money laundering related to purchase of a property in London at 12, Bryanston Square, worth 1.9 million pounds.
Special Judge Arvind Kumar granted permission to Vadra to go to Spain for two weeks from today.
The court directed him to submit a fixed deposit receipt (FDR) of Rs 25 lakh and his contact details and address of his stay abroad.
In June, it had allowed him to travel to the US and the Netherlands for six weeks on account of health reasons. The court, however, had not allowed Vadra to go to the United Kingdom.
The ED had expressed apprehension that the accused may destroy the evidence if allowed to go to the UK.
On April 1, Vadra was directed not to leave the country without prior permission by the local court, which had granted him conditional anticipatory bail.

Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale yesterday pulled a surprise after he showed up at the Accra Sports stadium for his soundcheck with a helicopter before heading to his hotel room to rest ahead of the concert later in the evening.
Some few hours after this, Shatta Wale took to social media to laugh at the celebrities who had gone to the Kempinski Grand Hotel to have a ‘Meet and Greet’ session with Cardi B but were disappointed.
That didn’t end there as he posted on his page again hammering on the fact that Ghana is still a village.
He posted: “WHEN I SAY GHANA BE VILLAGE…..DEM GO TALK SAY WHY”
But Archipalago who has been trolling the celebrities after the incident sent an epic respond to Shatta Wale
He responded: “U made it look more village by hiring a helicopter just for #CardiB to recognize you ???Kwasia Banku Abeteku”

- The award was presented by Garba Shehu, an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari
- Garba told the audience that he had come a long way with Melaye and that they had carried out projects together
The former senator representing Kogi West at the National Assembly, Dino Melaye, has won the ‘Man of the Year’ award just days after losing a return to the legislative chamber.
However, a mild drama ensued when the organisers of the award called Garba Shehu, a spokesperson of President Muhammadu Buhari, to present the award to the former senator.
The mention of Garba resulted in guests clapping and hailing in surprise.
Even Melaye, who was standing while his citation was read out, could not hold his laughter as well.

The drama continued as Garba came out, stood before Melaye, paused for a moment before speaking. This action further caused laughter in the audience.
Garba then asked jokingly after collecting the plaque to be presented to Melaye: “Should I just take this thing and leave him standing here?”
He told the guests that he had been close to Dino Melaye being that the duo had come a very long way. He added that they had worked together on many projects. He noted that politics has a way of bringing people together and also dividing them.
In his reaction after receiving the award, Melaye described Garba as his brother and friend. He confirmed that the two of them have a longstanding relationship beyond the current dispensation.
“And I appreciate him for presenting this award. I appreciate the organisers,” Melaye said.
He was described as the most performed and vibrant member of the National Assembly. Melaye had also won senator of the year in 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disaster as Zim high school girl, boyfriend die during sex</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A young high school student died on Saturday while having sex with her lover. According to sources, the incident occurred at PamaStones Shopping Complex.
The girl who has only been identified as Daisy was a form three student at Highfield High 1 School.
However, her age was not revealed.
It is suspected that Daisy may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning which may have triggered an asthmatic attack, which resulted in her suffocating.
This is due to the fact, that Daisy and her boyfriend John were having their stolen moment of intimacy in the generator room at the local shops. John who is a tuckshop attendant at the shops nearly died as well.
A witness said,
Daisy’s family is reported to be unamused by John’s antics when Daisy was still alive. They have since demanded the full bride price from John before they can bury Daisy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Pankaj Mishra] India’s problems bigger than Modi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new narrative about India is suddenly emerging. Until very recently, India appeared to be a great democracy as well as a rising economic power, a potential partner of the West in its policy of containing China. Writing in Time magazine in 2015, no less a moral and political authority than Barack Obama hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as India’s “reformer-in-chief” who “reflects the dynamism and potential of India’s rise.”
However, the latest, radically different narrative about India holds that the country is flailing, its politics and civil society captured by a Hindu supremacist movement, and its economy trapped in a potentially long slowdown.
Evidence that India’s prime minister is not the smart economic modernizer he seemed to many in the West has become steadily incontrovertible, especially after he quixotically withdrew most currency notes in circulation in 2016.
This week, an exhaustively researched report in the New Yorker by Dexter Filkins provided spine-chilling evidence that India is ruled by cold-blooded ideological fanatics, who will use all means to achieve their aims. These can range from perversion of the media, judiciary and military to anti-Muslim pogroms, targeted assassinations of critics and collective punishment of a minority.
Such a dramatic reversal of reputations -- “from hero to zero,” as the Indian wisecrack goes -- is not new in India’s case. For much of India’s seven decades, when it appeared to be on the wrong side of the Cold War, Western commentators regarded the country as a basket case.
As Thomas Friedman put it in “The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century,” India was “known as a country of snake charmers, poor people, and Mother Teresa” before it was abruptly rebranded, including by Friedman, as a “country of brainy people and computer wizards.”
As India embraced market capitalism, moved away from its Russian friends and came closer to the West, every major Western periodical, from the Economist and Foreign Affairs to the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, started to broadcast the myth of an irresistibly “rising” India.
As India suffers another downgrade in global reputation, it is worth asking: How do fundamentally defective narratives acquire outsize influence? And, is the new narrative about India as simplistic and misleading as the old?
Certainly, it has long been clear that India, which failed to invest in primary education and health, did not have the human capital and infrastructure necessary for what it urgently needed: a labor-intensive manufacturing revolution of the kind that made such “East Asian Tigers” as South Korea and Taiwan.
Economic growth in India was built on such shaky foundations as speculative finance capital and construction, and never seemed strong and consistent enough to generate jobs for the approximately million people entering the workforce each month.
Nor was India robust enough to contribute effectively to the Western coalition against China. India humiliatingly lost a border war in 1962 and several subsequent diplomatic-military scuffles. It has not even come close to matching its neighbor’s economic performance.
But commentators were too bedazzled by such notions as (John McCain’s) “league of democracies” and too influenced in their thinking by a Cold War division of the world into blocs and counterblocs.
Many Indians living or educated in the West were seduced by the idea that their country, which once mortifyingly denoted elephants, Maharajahs and beggars to the average Westerner, was assuming its place among the elite nations.
As for those in the knowledge industry (academics, journalists, columnists, think-tankers), it is always tempting to set aside intellectual hesitations and moral scruples and stand with history’s seeming winners.
It will be no less tempting to recoil from its supposed losers. Indeed, as multiple crises rock India, from crippling bank debts to lynch mobs, many of its previous promoters repackage themselves as outspoken critics of Modi.
These unreliable narrators of India should not make us forget, however, that long before Modi came to power in 2014, the country’s economy had already developed its unhealthy dependence on finance, corruption and inequality were intolerable, and politicians accused of anti-minority pogroms revolved serenely through the corridors of power.
Torture and extrajudicial execution have been commonplace for decades, especially in Kashmir and insurgency-affected central India. In 2013, the Supreme Court sent a Kashmiri to the gallows on flimsy circumstantial evidence, arguing that “the collective conscience of the society will only be satisfied if the capital punishment is awarded to the offender.”
To India’s hollowed-out institutions, Modi has delivered a lusty kick; they have predictably collapsed into a heap. But the dust that rises from them should not again cloud our optics.
Modi is a symptom rather than the main cause of the country’s political degeneration and economic stagnation. Until this is acknowledged, it won’t be possible to correctly diagnose, let alone stem, India’s deepening rot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tech, climate change creating new inequalities: UN</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new generation of global inequalities fueled by climate change and technology could trigger violence and political instability if left unchecked, the United Nations warned on Monday.
Climate change and technology rather than wealth and income are the modern-day wedges that are increasingly dividing the haves from the have-nots, said the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in its 2019 Human Development Report.
These forms of inequality are rising as progress has been made in more traditional measures of inequality such as extreme poverty and disease, it said.
"Under the shadow of the climate crisis and sweeping technological change, inequalities in human development are taking new forms," the report said.
"The climate crisis is already hitting the poorest hardest, while technological advances such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can leave behind entire groups of people, even countries."
Allowing these new inequalities to grow could be "extremely dangerous and highly volatile," said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.
"Across the rich and emerging countries and also developing countries where a middle class has emerged, their reactions are increasingly violent," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of the report's release.
"If not managed well and practically, it will essentially manifest itself in what we see on the evening news - burning cars, burning buildings, burning infrastructure, millions of people in the streets protesting and overthrowing governments."
Street protests have filled the news of late, in Hong Kong, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela and elsewhere over an array of issues including rising prices, government policies, corruption and pro-democracy movements.
The UNDP report said climate change will fuel inequality as it hits developing countries, many with limited capacity to resist threats from malnutrition, disease and heat stress.
"So the effects of climate change deepen existing social and economic fault lines," it said.
As to technology's effect on inequality, the report said the proportion of adults with university-level educations was growing more than six times faster in highly developed countries than in lower developed countries.
It also said fixed broadband subscriptions were growing 15 times faster in developed countries.
"These are the inequalities that will likely determine people's ability to ... function in a knowledge economy," it said.
The changes come as many more people today no longer live in extreme poverty, Steiner said.
"Our aspirations have changed," he said. "People are not just looking at the dollars in their account. They are looking at opportunities, at social mobility and at freedom of choice."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Director-General of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, Dr. Femi Oke-_Osanyintolu, is expected to deliver a lecture on safety at home as management of Radio Lagos Station is holding a seven day home appliances fair and lecture for residents.
The event is slated to commence from December 10th to 19th, 2019.
General Manager, Radio Lagos, Eko FM, Mrs. Ayo Sotonwa who disclosed this at a news conference, held in the corporation’s ground,  Ikeja, added that the opening ceremony of the home appliances fair would be held at the Eko FM multi-purpose hall on 10 to 16th, with a lecture by Oke-_Osanyintolu, who will speak on the topic: “safety at home.”
The lecture, according to her, aimed at ensuring and boosting safety culture at individual homes on how to prevent the avoidable disaster that could lead to loss of lives and properties.
Sotonwa explained that the fair is being organised as part of a commitment to promote household items and afford both manufactures and dealers in home appliances to interact and display products in order to attract more patronage from the public at affordable prices.
Sotonwa said it is expected at the end of the fair members of the public would have been introduced to a wide range of new products in the market and genuine not fake.
The Secretary of the planning committee, Mr. Lateef Balogun however, called on interested exhibitors to contact the radio corporation for further details.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brussels: European Union foreign ministers debated Monday how to respond to a controversial agreement between Turkey and Libya that could give Turkey access to a contested economic zone across the Mediterranean Sea.The maritime border deal, endorsed by the Turkish parliament last week, has fueled tensions in Turkey’s long-running dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil and gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Greece has already expelled the Libyan ambassador over it.Before chairing the meeting, new EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that “it’s not a matter of sanctions today.” He said the ministers would study a “memorandum of understanding” agreed upon between Turkey and Libya, which was only made public in recent days.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said “it’s a little bit astounding how they split up the Mediterranean among themselves. We’ll have to see how we deal with it.”Greece, Cyprus, and Egypt, which lie between Turkey and Libya geographically, have blasted the accord as being contrary to international law. Some EU partners of Greece and Cyprus seem to agree.“The Netherlands is always a staunch supporter of the rule of international law, and we side with Greece,” said Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok. “International law should be upheld.”Although they are NATO allies, neighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NATO-China: New relationship challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Last week, leaders of its 29 member states gathered for a two-day summit in London. And for the very first time, the group in its joint statement named and mentioned China.
As Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, has put it, the alliance must “better understand the rise of China and what it means for our security in terms of opportunities and challenges.”
Stoltenberg pointed out that China is now the world’s second largest defense spender, and that there is a pressing need to incorporate Beijing into major arms control agreements that are concluded among the great powers in future.
He stressed that this was not “about moving NATO into the South China Sea”, and also denied that the decades-old military alliance trying to create a new enemy.
However, as China is now aggressively enhancing both its economic and military presence across the world, including in the Arctic Circle and in Africa, NATO needs to start taking “into account that China is coming closer to us,” Stoltenberg noted.
As we all know, the United States has remained the strongest stakeholder in NATO.
Now, as the alliance has chosen to officially respond to the rise of China at a time when the relationship between Washington and Beijing is continuing to deteriorate, it raises the possibility that a “New Cold War” between China and the West may be in the making.
In particular, as “containing China” has become a bipartisan consensus in the US, even if President Donald Trump fails to get his second term in the 2020 election, Washington is likely to just fine-tune, but not change drastically, the current policy line no matter who will be in charge of the White House in the future.
As far as China is concerned, it may be facing an equally severe challenge like the West. Now that it has come on to the NATO radar, and is shrouded heavily in the shadow of a “New Cold War”, the Asian giant’s path toward becoming the world’s next superpower may turn out to be a bumpy one.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A woman who was drugged and sexually assaulted by her flatmate was called a s**t in court by her attacker's girlfriend on Monday. 
The woman's flatmate had put the drug GHB, known as fantasy, in her drink when they had shared a bottle of wine and some vodka in August 2016. 
The woman became unconscious and woke up to the 34-year-old flatmate kissing her and her pants had been removed, the court heard according to The Gold Coast Bulletin. 
Toxicology tests showed there was GHB in her urine but she had never knowingly taken the drug. 
The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, had moved into the unit just two weeks before the incident. 
The now 37-year-old appeared in Southport District Court on Monday and plead guilty to one count of administering a drug for the purpose of sexual assault and sexual assault. 
He was sentenced to two years prison, suspended after six months. 
At the conclusion of proceedings the man's girlfriend walked passed the victim, who had been crying, and reportedly said s**t. 
She then followed that up by telling the woman: 'I am going to get you, you dog'. 
The defence barrister for the man said he was fully clothed during the assault and had undergone counselling since the incident. 
He also said the man's motivation was to make the woman more easily persuaded rather than to render her unconscious. 
When delivering the sentence, Judge Catherine Muir, however, said the attack was a serious breach of trust by the man who the woman had allowed to live in her unit.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Bill protesters burnt tyres, clashed with police and many raised slogans with swords in their hands in parts of Assam, as Home Minister Amit Shah gears up to table the Bill in Lok Sabha on Monday.
One protester sustained serious head injuries in a clash with police in the Dhemaji district in North Assam during the 12-hour Assam bandh called by the students' unions representing the Moran and the Chutia communities. The North East Students' Organisation (NESO), including the All Assam Students' Union, also called a bandh across the region on Tuesday. 
Upper Assam districts such as Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Majuli witnessed strong protests as thousands spilled onto the streets demanding the scrapping of the Bill. "We are ready to die but will never accept the Bill," one of the protesters shouted in front of television cameras in Dhemaji district. 
The Bill seeks to allow "religious persecuted minorities" from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan such as Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs, who had migrated till December 2014, to apply for Indian citizenship after a stay of six years. Organisations representing indigenous communities fear that such a move would reduce the ethnic communities into minorities and endanger their cultural identity. They want all foreigners, irrespective of religion, to be detected based on the March 24, 1971 cut-off date.
Many also staged protests in front of residence and offices of leaders of the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the regional ally of the BJP for not opposing the Bill. Many people belonging to the non-Muslim communities, whose names were left out of the NRC, however, are pinning hope on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill to end the uncertainty over their citizenship claim.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Duel on a Sinking Ship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foreign observers find it difficult to understand the developments of the Lebanese situation and its sudden turns. This is not surprising. Lebanon is not a normal democracy, to which the known rules of such system apply.Lebanon’s democracy is bizzare. It resembles nothing but itself. A fragile democracy that is constantly on the brink of collapse and only escapes with treatments that today are no longer available.The Lebanese find it difficult to explain to non-Lebanese what is going on in the Land of Cedars. The game there is not governed by the accepted rules regarding elections, majority, and minority.It is not enough to reflect on the provisions of the constitution to understand the story. It is true there is a constitution that is supposed to regulate the life of this republic that is heading towards bankruptcy. But the constitution alone is not enough.There are turns, circumventions, and ambiguities, as well as the ingenuity of the designers of derogatory constitutional models, who have imaginations that exceed the skillful minds of the most famous fashion designers such as Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, and others.Unfortunately, the constitution is not the referee, nor has it the last say. In difficult seasons, it becomes the victim, not the guardian. Disregarding the constitution has become entrenched, as has the habit of disregarding the citizens.Lebanese political games seemed amusing and cute on normal days. But they are painful and provocative in a country that sends out distress calls, such as drifting ships at sea… A country, in which words such as collapse and bankruptcy are in all conversations… A country, where a citizen commits suicide for not being able to secure half a dollar for his daughter or sets himself on fire for his inability to provide bread or to pay school fees for his children.I don’t want to be too pessimistic and say that a beautiful Lebanon is just a lie that was invented by the Rahbanis and promoted by the scattered gold from the voice of Fairouz.I was willing to write about another topic. But what happened yesterday provoked me.The prevailing impression was that the binding parliamentary consultations, which President Michel Aoun was scheduled to conduct after a long wait and stalling, would result in the nomination of businessman Samir al-Khatib. The latter was expected to form the government that would face the most difficult task in Lebanon’s independent history, especially since the economic collapse is no longer an imminent threat, but rather a reality.According to rumors, the choice of Khatib would have freed the government from the burden of some ministers, who went too far in poisoning the Lebanese water of coexistence.Suddenly, Khatib, following a visit to Grand Mufti Abdullatif Derian, announced his withdrawal from the race, saying that the Sunni community was unanimous in supporting Saad Hariri as prime minister.Hariri had previously announced that he was not interested in forming the new government, after the other team insisted on a techno-political cabinet. He argued that only a technocrat government could help resolve the economic and financial collapse and address the international community.With the postponement of binding parliamentary consultations, it seemed clear that it was difficult to overcome what became known as the “Hariri node”.This node started since his father’s entry in the club of prime ministers in 1992 with an exceptional aura and as a striking force based on an arsenal of Arab and international relations, in addition to his financial capabilities.Hariri succeeded in becoming the axis around which the regime revolved, despite the Syrian tutelage in Lebanon. The search for the president of the republic began on the basis of who can control and obstruct Hariri, after it became difficult to continue without him.Despite the differences, the experience was repeated with Saad Hariri, who suddenly emerged in the Lebanese arena, carrying the coffin of his father, whose assassination in 2005 constituted a turning point in the turbulent life of the Republic and put it on the path of decline.The “Hariri node” was present in the elections and the formation of governments. His presence was imperative and his opponents had no option but to accept him, seek to obstruct him, and set ambushes to topple him whenever the opportunity aroused.The Hariri government was brought down at the hands of Aoun and his allies. But the man returned to the Serail because he was the strongest in his sect and because he kept most of the arsenal of international relations that his father engineered and excelled in maintaining.When the Hariri sect insists today on his appointment as prime minister, it acts in the same way as Michel Aoun’s allies, when they kept postponing the presidential elections to ensure his arrival as the figure who represents the most the Maronite community, and after the country suffered for years from what was known as the “Aoun node”.A third node in the current system is that of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. The State is unable to have a say on major issues without his approval.The past years have consolidated a dangerous norm. The strongest man in a sect or confession cannot be trespassed. This norm has distorted the Lebanese system, even if it was not translated in constitutional texts.There are those who are demanding the return of Hariri because he is the best able to address the Arab and international community, perhaps because he could save the Lebanese sinking ship. Others are calling for his return to be a partner in bearing the consequences of the collapse, as hopes for survival are diminishing.The dance of alliances and bickering between the Lebanese islands was taking place in a country that had long succeeded in postponing the hour of truth. But today, it is taking place in a country that witnesses the largest protest movement in its history amid rising poverty, unemployment, and bankruptcy.Politicians went too far in the game of coalitions and wrangling, and they did not stop at the signs of internal deterioration, nor at the US-Iranian tension line.Lebanon is a difficult story that transcends its men. It is a magnificent Rahbani lie, where the resounding voice of Fairouz rises above tremendous destruction.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hundreds spend the night in sleeping bags on Times Square</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jim O’Shea and Dan Niland sat atop a bright blue mat inside a secured pedestrian plaza in Times Square on Saturday, playing cards as they prepared for the night ahead.
Piles of pillows, yoga mats, sleeping mats and bags surrounded them. Others came with bags of chips or stuffed animals.
O’Shea and Niland did not know what to expect as they prepared to sleep in one of four designated plazas in Times Square along with some 900 others to raise awareness about homelessness.
Although he would spend the night in a sleeping bag with no food as temperatures dipped to the mid-20s, O’Shea said that when he returned to his Upper West Side home Sunday morning, he would come back to a bed, shower and heat.
“I can’t ever relate to the helplessness and hopelessness of being truly homeless because I really do have those keys in my pocket, but at least for one night we are creating awareness to imagine what it’d be like sleeping outside,” O’Shea, 54, said.
The gathering Saturday, called the World’s Big Sleep Out, was organised by Josh Littlejohn, the owner of a chain of Scottish sandwich shops and an advocate for providing jobs, shelter and housing for people who need them. He described homelessness as a crisis that all countries have an obligation to address.
Thousands of people agreed to sleep outside overnight in at least 50 cities, including New York, London and New Delhi, to raise awareness of the problem of homelessness and the need for money to fight it.
Like many who take part in charity walks or runs, participants in Littlejohn’s event have collected pledges for donations from supporters.
In New York, people committed to spending the night in sleeping bags in Times Square, surrounded by the area’s pulsating lights and neon signs. Actor Will Smith read a “bedtime story” to the crowd.
There was star power in other major cities. Musicians Jake Bugg and Tom Walker performed, and actress Helen Mirren read to participants in Trafalgar Square in London. Ziggy Marley, Ellie Goulding, Meghan Trainor and Sean Kingston entertained those taking part at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.
The sleep out, Littlejohn emphasised, was “in no way an emulation of actually being homeless.” But, he added, those who spend the night outside would “undoubtedly leave with a different sense of perspective and a heightened sense of compassion.”
There are an estimated 3,900 homeless people living on New York City’s streets. Just how dangerous such a life can be was underscored in October, when four homeless men were bludgeoned to death as they slept on the sidewalks of Chinatown in Manhattan. The accused killer, a 24-year-old man, was homeless himself.
Littlejohn has set a fundraising target of $50 million for his event. Half the money would go to non-profit groups that deal with homelessness in the communities where the donations come from, like the Coalition for the Homeless in New York.
The other half is to go to charities around the world like UNICEF that help people displaced not only by extreme poverty, but also by armed conflict and natural disasters.
The sleep out will be followed by a political drive led by the Institute of Global Homelessness, an advocacy group with a goal of eliminating unsheltered homelessness in 150 cities and countries by 2030. The group plans to work with governments in different countries to come up with ways of addressing the problem.
Louise Casey, a former British government official with expertise in social services, is the institute’s chairwoman. When Tony Blair was Britain’s prime minister, he appointed Casey as the country’s “homelessness czar.”
She said she was disheartened by the rising number of people living on the street in Britain and elsewhere. She recently visited California, where an increase in income inequality and a lack of affordable housing have combined to push many people into homeless encampments.
“I was shellshocked,” Casey said. “What in God’s name is happening here? I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve been to every continent.”
Littlejohn, 33, said he had no idea that he would become interested in finding international solutions to homelessness when he opened Social Bite, an Edinburgh sandwich shop, about seven years ago.
Pete Hart, who hawked The Big Issue, a magazine meant to give homeless people a way to make money without panhandling, was a fixture in front of the shop.
“He came into the cafe and he sort of plucked up the courage and he asked us if he could have a job,” Littlejohn said.
After Hart began working in the kitchen, he told Littlejohn that his brother Joe also lived on the street and needed a job.
Littlejohn was soon employing both brothers and their friends. He was also feeding up to 50 people a day, asking customers to “pay it forward” by buying meals that could be given to homeless people.
In 2016, in an early version of the event Saturday, Littlejohn persuaded about 270 Scottish business leaders to sleep overnight in an Edinburgh park to call attention to the problem. Last year, with land that had belonged to the City of Edinburgh, Social Bite opened about a dozen small homes as stable housing for people who had lived on the streets.
Joe Hart, 30, works in construction now and is no longer homeless. He said he found it hard to believe that asking for a job at the sandwich shop years ago had wound up making him a part of an international campaign to raise money and awareness for trying to end homelessness.
He recalled his own life on the streets and how poorly some passersby had treated him. “People look down on you,” he said, adding that some of them would even “be spitting on you.”
Hart said he hoped that Littlejohn’s campaign would make the public more sympathetic.
“It’s not everyone’s choice to end up on the street,” he said. “It’s not a choice to end up like that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka’s state broadcaster to air ‘Matir Projar Deshe’ on Dec 15</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sri Lanka’s state-owned Independent Television Network or ITN will broadcast a Bangladeshi film, ‘Matir Projar Deshe’.
The film will be aired at 10pm on Dec 15 with subtitles in Sinhalese, according to Goopy Bagha Productions Ltd and Bangladesh High Commission in Sri Lanka.
Arifur Rahman is the producer and Imtiaz Ahmed Bijon directed the movie.
“More than three million viewers will watch the movie in Bangla language,” the production house said in a statement.
This is a gift for Bangladesh’s Independence and Language Movement from Sri Lanka, just the day before Dec 16, it said.
“I don’t think a Bangladeshi film has been aired on the terrestrial television of any other country; I guess Sri Lanka is the pioneer,” High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah told bdnews24.com.
The state-owned TV station has prepared the subtitle for the film at its own cost, he said adding the initiative was made possible because of the continuation of Bangladesh Film Festival in Sri Lanka.
“I had a discussion with the ITN chairman on the issue a year back. Later, we’ve come up to this stage in a tripartite arrangement with the filmmakers and producers.”
Matir Projar Deshe was premiered at the Seattle International Film in 2016. It won the best film award at the Chicago South Asian Film Festival the same year. It was released in Bangladesh in 2018.
The cast includes Jayanta Chattopadhyay, Rokeya Prachy, Kachi Khandakar, Sheuli Akhter, Chinmoyee Gupta, Ramiz Raju, Abdullah Rana, Monir Ahmed Shakeel, Rikita Nandini Shimu and others. The cinematographers were Ramshreyas Rao and Andrew Wiseman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore's Tamil community over 2,000-year old: Book</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Tamil community has been present in South East Asia and Singapore for more than 2,000 years, according to a new book that explores the lesser-known aspects of Tamil history and heritage.
Titled 'From Sojourners To Settlers - Tamils in Southeast Asia and Singapore', the book was launched on Saturday by Singapore's Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran at the Indian Heritage Centre.
It explores the lesser-known aspects of Tamil history and heritage in South East Asia and Singapore, examining evidence of Tamil connections with the region for more than 2,000 years.
Among evidence looked at are the inscriptions on the Singapore Stone, which some experts say date back to the 10th century, The Straits Times reported.
A key artefact in Singapore's National Collection, the Singapore Stone was formerly located at the mouth of the Singapore River before the British destroyed it with dynamite in 1843.
Researcher Iain Sinclair, a contributor to the book, recently identified the phrase "kesariva" in the inscriptions found on parts of the Singapore Stone.
He said it could be part of the word "parakesarivarman" - a title used by several Chola kings of the Chola dynasty, a Tamil dynasty of southern India and one of the longest-ruling dynasties in history.
"The Tamil community in Singapore is clearly identifiable but not easily definable and any attempt to do so is fraught with challenges ranging from semantics to politics," Iswaran said.
Iswaran addressed the efforts by early Tamil pioneers in shaping Singapore's identity and laying the foundations of contemporary Tamil culture and practice in the city-state.
"Colonial Singapore was a microcosm of India's diverse cultural background and landscape - its vast, seemingly endless range of sub-ethnicities and linguistic groups," he said.
Iswaran noted that Tamil Muslims established Singapore's first vernacular press while Indian merchants and moneylenders, including the South Indian Chettiars, were the source of credit and banking before the advent of European banks in the 19th century.
"Today, Tamil is one of our four official languages, and community and state-supported efforts to promote the Tamil language and culture continue with vigour," he said.
English, Mandarin and Malay are the other official languages in Singapore.
"Tamil Singaporeans, who constitute a majority of the Indian population in our nation, are a vibrant and diverse community, who continue to play an important role in shaping Singapore's future," Iswaran said.
Besides Singapore, Malaysia has the largest number of Indians, majority of which are Tamilians.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Absolute tragedy' - one women dead and another hospitalised after swimmers got into difficulty off Antrim beach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A WOMAN has died and another is in hospital after a group of swimmers got into difficulty off Ballycastle beach, Co Antrim this morning.
Emergency services were alerted to the incident shortly before 8.30am.
A Coastguard spokesman said it received a call after reports of two women in the water.
"We tasked two RNLI lifeboats, one from Red Bay and one from Portrush and two coastguard rescue teams, one from Ballycastle and one from Coleraine," the spokesman said.
"A Coastguard rescue helicopter was also sent to the scene. As the first team was arriving they reported that the two females were out of the water. The ambulance service was dealing with the casualties so we stood down the two RNLI lifeboats and the Coastguard helicopter."
The spokesman said the woman taken to hospital was being treated for hypothermia.
The Northern Health Trust confirmed that the woman's condition was stable.
Inspector Mick Wood added: "Police received a report from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service shortly after 8.30am for the concern for safety of two female swimmers at Ballycastle beach in the Cushendall Road area.
"Officers attended the scene along with other emergency services colleagues, including the Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service, Air Ambulance NI and The Coastguard.
"Tragically, one of the women passed away at the scene.
"The second female has been taken to hospital where she remains undergoing treatment.
"Our officers remain at the scene as we continue to deal with this tragic incident."
DUP MP Ian Paisley has extended his condolences to those affected by the incident.
He told the Belfast Telegraph: "It is a regular beauty spot for people to go swimming, especially fresh water swimming and you usually find a lot of accomplished swimmers up round there.
"Unfortunately it appears one of these poor people have got into tragic circumstances, maybe caught in a riptide. Another person is in hospital, I understand quite seriously ill with hypothermia. My heart goes out to them and their families...
"It is an absolute tragedy and my sympathies and prayers are with these folk."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Telangana HC orders bodies of Hyderabad accused to be preserved till December 13</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Telangana High Court on Monday ordered to preserve the bodies of the accused in the Telangana doctor's rape and murder case till December 13. The matter has been posted for hearing on December 12.
The alleged rapists were shot down by the Cyberabad police on Friday after they tried to run away during the recreation of crime scene. The police claimed that the accused had snatched their weapons and fired at them, following which the police fired in retaliation, leading to their death.
The Telangana government has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the killing of four accused in the rape and murder of a woman veterinarian in "retaliatory" firing by police last week.
A Government Order was issued in this regard on Sunday.
"The cause and circumstances leading to the death of the four persons should be ascertained with reasons and establish truth and in view of the fact that the case requires sustained and focused investigation, a SIT is constituted to investigate the case," the Order said.
The eight-member SIT led by Rachakonda Police Commissioner Mahesh M Bhagwat, should immediately take over investigation in the case registered over the "exchange of fire" and all other related cases registered in the state as per Supreme Court guidelines, it said.
The SIT should complete the investigation and submit the report before a competent court of law, it said.
The four were arrested on November 29 for allegedly raping and killing the woman by smothering her and later burning the body.
A petition has also been moved in the Supreme Court questioning the legality of the Hyderabad encounter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Electricity vandals throw nine Anambra communities into darkness</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Enugu Electricity Distribution (EEDC) on Monday said that about nine communities were affected by the power outage resulting from vandalism of Enugwu-Ukwu 33KV line.
Mr Emeka Ezeh, Head of EEDC Communications Department, made this known in a statement made available to newsmen in Awka.
Ezeh said the vandalism on its installation was carried out early Sunday.
He said that valuable equipment were carted away from the line which transmits to Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo and Nimo 11KV feeders.
He said the communities affected were, Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo, Nimo, Nawfia, Umuokpu, Abba, Ifitedunu and parts of Amawbia, left without electricity supply.
According to him, EEDC regrets to inform her esteemed customers under Enugwu-Ukwu 33KV line that the current loss of supply being experienced is as a result of the vandalism of the 33KV network feeding them.
“This network radiates from Agu Awka Transmission Substation, Awka, Anambra.
“Materials carted away include five spans of aluminium conductors, all-fibre cross-arms and 33KV pot insulators and also a broken high tension pole.
“Consequently, our customers in the entire Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo, Nimo, Nawfia, Umuokpu, Abba, Ifitedunu and parts of Amawbia are without electricity supply,” he said.
Ezeh said that efforts were on to fix the problem and restore power supply.
He urged customers of EEDC to see protection of its installations as a shared responsibility.
“Plans are on to address this challenge and we assure our customers that supply will be restored as soon as repairs and replacement are completed.
“EEDC remains committed to providing her esteemed customers with improved service delivery while soliciting for their continued support in ensuring that such an incident does not occur in the network,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I-League: Real Kashmir FC's two home games postponed after closure of Srinagar airport</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Real Kashmir FC’s two upcoming home I-League matches were on Monday postponed owing to inclement weather which has forced closure of the Srinagar airport, the All India Football Federation said on Monday.
Flight operations at Srinagar airport have been disrupted since Sunday due to dense fog.
“With the Srinagar Airport not being operational due to poor weather conditions, Real Kashmir Football Club’s first two home matches against Gokulam Kerala FC on December 12, 2019, and Churchill Brothers FC Goa on December 15, 2019, stands postponed,” the AIFF said in a press release.
No flight operations took place on Monday morning because of poor visibility. Primary schools were also closed due to adverse weather conditions as heavy fog engulfed most parts of the valley.
“New dates for the matches will be announced soon,” the AIFF added.
Real Kashmir FC, which finished third in its debut season last year, had opened its campaign with a 1-1 draw against East Bengal at Kalyani, West Bengal, on December 4.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cherry blossoms prompt full-blown scandal for Japan's PM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tokyo,  It might be the most Japanese of political scandals: a furore over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's guest list at a party to mark the annual cherry blossom season.
As scandals go, it has plenty of juicy elements -- alleged mafia guests, disappearing evidence, even gaffes by Abe, who appeared to lay blame for shredded documents on a disabled worker.
It's the latest headache for Japan's longest-serving premier, who has already weathered two cronyism scandals in recent years and has faced an almost daily drubbing by opposition lawmakers since the scandal emerged in early November.
The outcry involves a tradition that dates back to 1952 -- a publicly funded cherry blossom party intended to honour the great and the good for their achievements.
The seemingly innocuous gathering become a lightning rod for criticism after claims Abe stacked the guest list with some 850 supporters from his local constituency -- with the party costing 55 million yen ($504,000) in public money.
When the opposition smelled blood, additional allegations piled in: the chairman of a disgraced company was once a guest, a member of one of Japan's infamous yakuza mafia attended in 2019.
The opposition bloc demanded the guest list for this year's event be produced, only to be told it had been shredded on the very same day the request was made.
Just a coincidence, Abe insisted to outraged opposition lawmakers: the documents were shredded during "the work hours of a part-time employee with disabilities," he added, in remarks that many saw as an attempt to blame the worker.
'Abe can hold on'
The scandal has seen public support for Abe's government drop six or seven points to around 50 percent or lower, but experts said Abe is likely to weather the storm.
"Voters are not convinced by the Abe administration's explanation of the scandal," Junichi Saito, a professor of politics at Tokyo's Waseda University, told AFP.
"But opinion polls will not likely fall by more than 10 percentage points because there is no other candidate for a prime minister."
Abe benefits from lingering disillusionment with the country's opposition, with voters still leery after the disastrous performance of the centre-left Democratic Party-led government in 2009-2012.
"I'm sceptical at this point that the opposition will win public support if it manages to dent Abe's with this scandal," Tobias Harris, senior vice president of consulting firm Teneo, told AFP.
"The worst case scenario for Abe is that (his ruling party) LDP supporters abandon him, which hasn't happened thus far, giving him a floor of around thirty percent (support)," he added.
"But even then, without a smoking gun I think Abe can hold on for a long time."
'Better than lying'
Allegations have continued to emerge, including claims that Abe invited supporters to a dinner at a luxury hotel and let his political support group pick up part of the tab in violation of election law.
His government denies that, and a criminal investigation is viewed as extremely unlikely.
Still, Saito said, the allegations risk damaging public faith in the political system.
"This administration is trying to avert criticism" by withholding documents, and that "hurts a system (of accountability) that is necessary for democracy".
Next year's cherry blossom party has been cancelled, with Abe promising to "reflect on" how the gathering has been organised.
That is likely to be enough to tide him over, Junichi Takase, professor of politics at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies, told AFP.
"The opposition bloc has nothing else in their arsenal except attacking Mr Abe for this kind of scandal," he said.
"Mr Abe is good at handling crises. He admitted there was something wrong, apologised, and wants to move on -- that's better than lying."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trump warns Kim has 'everything' to lose through hostility</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump warned Sunday that North Korea's Kim Jong Un had "everything" to lose through hostility towards the United States, after Pyongyang said it had carried out a major new weapons test."Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way," Trump tweeted in response to the unspecified test at the Sohae space launch center.The announcement of Saturday's test came just hours after Trump said he would be "surprised" by any hostile action from the North, emphasizing his "very good relationship" with Kim.Trump and Kim engaged in months of mutual insults and threats of devastation in 2017, sending tensions soaring before a diplomatic rapprochement the following year.The pair have met three times since June 2018 but with little progress towards denuclearization. Pyongyang has set Washington a December 31 deadline to make new concessions to kickstart stalled talks."North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearize as promised," Trump tweeted."NATO, China, Russia, Japan, and the entire world is unified on this issue!"Writing that Kim had "signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement" at their June 2018 summit in Singapore," Trump warned: "He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November."Separately, interviewed on the CBS TV news program "Face the Nation," US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien was asked whether North Korea was preparing to restart nuclear tests."I hope not. That would be a mistake on the part of North Korea," O'Brien said."Kim Jong Un promised to denuclearize North Korea," O'Brien said. "And we expect him to live up to the promise he made at the summit in Singapore. And we hope he'll do so."On Saturday, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in spoke by phone with Trump and agreed to maintain dialogue with Pyongyang.The 30-minute talk was the first conversation between Trump and the South Korean leader since they met at the UN General Assembly in New York in September."The two leaders shared an assessment that the current situation on the Korean peninsula is grave," said South Korean presidential spokeswoman Ko Min-jung, adding that Trump had requested the call.A spokesman for North Korea's Academy of National Defense Science said Saturday's "very important test" would have an "important effect" on changing the "strategic position" of North Korea, in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. -AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Karnataka bypolls will give battered BJP some confidence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With three more phases of Jharkhand Assembly election remaining to go, the BJP has received a boost in down south Karnataka, where its government was hanging by a thread tied to the by-elections held at 15 seats.
The BJP won 12 of the 15 seats where bypolls were held on December 5. The future of BS Yeddyurappa government of Karnataka depended on the outcome of the bypolls, which were necessitated by the disqualification of 17 MLAs of the Congress and the JDS earlier this year when the BJP returned to power in the middle of the allegations of horse-trading and defection-engineering.
With the election of 15 new members, the strength of Karnataka Assembly has gone up to 223. The normal strength of the house is 225. The truncated Karnataka Assembly had a strength of 208 making the BJP enjoying majority with 105 MLAs.
In the full-strength Karnataka Assembly, the ruling party requires support of 123 MLAs. Two seats still remain vacant. This means, the BJP requires support of 112 MLAs to keep Yeddyurappa secure. The BJP's own number has increased to 117 with the sweep in Karnataka bypolls.
This result is bound to give the BJP some confidence in Maharashtra, where it just lost power to ally-turned-rival Shiv Sena, Goa - where the Shiv Sena is said to be trying to unite anit-BJP leaders - and Jharkhand, where the BJP shed its long-standing allies in the ongoing election.
The BJP was looking battered after it failed to read unexpectedly stiff resistance from its oldest ally Shiv Sena which - the BJP feels rode on its back to emerge second-largest party in Maharashtra election - formed government in alliance with the NCP and the Congress. The BJP is the single-largest party and was outwitted not only by the Shiv Sena but also by NCP leader Ajit Pawar last month.
The Shiv Sena then claimed that Maharashtra experiment would be repeated in Goa, where the BJP is the single-largest party with 17 seats in the 40-member assembly. It is supported by the Goa Forward Party (3 MLAs), Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party (1 MLA) and three Independent MLAs. The BJP has spent much of its energy in keeping its alliance together since Shiv Sena's threat in Goa.
In Jharkhand, the BJP - smarting under the Shiv Sena shocker in Maharashtra - decided to go solo. This is the first time that the BJP is contesting an assembly election without its ally All Jharkhand Students Union since the state came into being in 2000.
The BJP cadre were reported to have been demotivated sensing that the once-again-emerging unity of the Opposition was gaining traction on the ground. The party had failed to secure majority in Haryana - where election was held along with Maharashtra - and was forced to show magnanimity in sharing power with fledgling Loknayak Janata Party of Dushyant Chautala.
The apparent reverses faced by the BJP in Haryana and Maharashtra -- with the Opposition claiming moral victory in one state and turning the saffron victory into an embarrassment in the other - have been neutralised for the BJP with clean sweep in Karnataka bypolls.
This was seen in the statements of Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar, who "accepted defeat" and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said, "Karnataka results show that in any state, if someone goes against the mandate of the people, they will be punished by the people."
This is a clear jibe at the Shiv Sena by PM Modi. But at the same time, it appears to be a message from PM Modi, in the wake of the Shiv Sena's Maharashtra machinations, to the allies of the BJP in states where elections are due next year. Bihar and Delhi will go to polls next year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HELSINKI: Finland's Social Democratic Party (SDP), one of the five parties set to form the coalition government, has picked 34-year-old Sanna Marin to be the country's youngest Prime Minister.
Marin, who is currently the Finnish Minister of Transport and Communications, narrowly won over Antti Lindtman, the 37-year-old chairman of the Social Democratic Parliamentary Group, in a vote of 32-29, Xinhua news agency reported.
The vote was carried out at the Social Democratic Party Council on Sunday evening. The results of the vote were announced in a nationally-televised broadcast.
The position of the prime minister became vacant as the cabinet under former Prime Minister Antti Rinne had to resign following the loss of confidence in him of one of the coalition partners, the Centre Party.
The previous coalition composition will continue. The five parties met on Sunday afternoon and pledged adherence to the program of the outgoing cabinet. The coalition comprises the Social Democrats, the Centre, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party.
Following her victory, Marin gave a brief statement calling for party unity. Procedural formalities of the government change will continue on Monday. Local media said President Sauli Niinisto is likely to appoint the new government on Tuesday.
Marin has been Finland's Minister of Transport and Communications since June of 2019. She is also SDP deputy chair, who led the party during Rinne's extended sick leave last winter. Marin is also a member of parliament.
She became nationally known first in the municipal political scene in Tampere, the second largest town in Finland. She was the chairperson of the City Council of Tampere from 2013 to 2017.
Marin has a master's degree in Administrative Sciences in Tampere University.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will govt seek a middle path via an independent review panel?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six months after the launch of the extradition bill-related protest movement, Hong Kong continues to grapple with large-scale street demonstrations and elevated public anger toward the establishment.
Although there have been mounting calls within society for an independent commission of inquiry (COI) into all the recent events, the government has continued to dig in its heels and is rejecting such demands.
Instead, all it is willing to do is to establish an independent review committee (IRC), which can look at the causes of the current social unrest, identify the underlying social, economic or political problems, and recommend measures that the administration should take, but which has no power to investigate or subpoena witnesses to testify before it.
As the proposed IRC is seen as no more than a “paper tiger”, it has fueled skepticism as to whether the government is truly sincere in trying to resolve the ongoing crisis.
Amid this situation, we now hear talk that the administration is taking a serious look at launching an IRC, and that it is deeply convinced that such move can help end the violence and chaos in society.
It is said that recently Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had personally asked Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong to put together a core working team that will look for the right candidates to sit on the IRC, and that we can expect major progress in the short run.
The idea of setting up an IRC was first put forward by Lam herself back in September when she announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.
Nevertheless, more than two months on, the administration is yet to make any solid announcement about the plan.
Meanwhile, there is chatter in the legal sector that the government did actually approach some retired judges to test the waters and inquire if they would be willing to head the IRC.
According to the analysis of a figure in the legal sector, the retired judges said ‘no’ as they didn’t want to be at the helm of a “toothless tiger”. 
It is understood that since no retired judge is willing to take up the task, some have suggested that the government should invite an academic with social status to lead the IRC.
However, it is said that the administration is still insisting on appointing a judge to chair the committee, mainly because of the impartial public image of judges, which, the authorities hope, can make the findings of the review more acceptable among society.
It is also said that in order to step up efforts at finding a prominent legal figure to lead the IRC, the chief executive has recently required Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee, the current head of the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office, to join forces with Law to form a core team to work on it.
In the meantime, Henry Fan Hung-ling, the newly appointed chairman of the Hospital Authority (HA), has outlined another suggestion last week.
Last Thursday, Fan publicly called upon the government to set up an IRC under the existing Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance, so that the committee can be vested with statutory power to summon witnesses.
Fan stressed that the IRC he proposed wasn’t intended to hold anybody accountable, but rather, to get to the root of the problem, such as finding out whether or not something has gone wrong with the police deployment.
Apparently, what Fan was trying to do is here to steer a middle course between the uncompromising stance of the government and the demands of protesters. And his proposal might at least be able to offer us some light at the end of the tunnel.
Unfortunately, as we have just learned, Fan’s suggestion hasn’t gained much favor with the government leadership.
The is largely because what he is proposing is seen by the administration as tantamount to having a “de facto COI” in the guise of an IRC, an idea that will deeply upset both the central authorities and the police.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reader’s comment: Pakistan’s movement to revive Punjabi culture faces no viable threat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This letter is a response to Prateek Joshi’s piece, which was published on December 4 (Pakistan’s bid to use Punjabi culture to deepen fault lines in India will only fan tensions at home). I have been closely affiliated with the movement for the revival of Punjabi language, culture, and identity – which we also call ‘Punjabiyat’, the term embracing shared geography, language, heritage, history and culture across religions in Pakistani Punjab – for the last three years.
This article is based on assumptions and sensational claims. It makes a complete hotchpotch of these very different terms to further a false claim. Neither the opening of Sikh holy places like Kartarpur for international pilgrims nor the promotion of Punjabiyat, Punjabi and Punjabi culture are currently fanning any “tensions” within Pakistan.The pilgrimage is being used to generate revenue and improve Pakistan’s image abroad, and the movement for Punjabiyat is still too young to pose a formidable threat to Pakistani state narrative or actors.
The article makes the following statement: “But for Pakistan, the policy of using Punjabi culture as a strategic tool has alienated conservative groups at home.” Which “conservative” groups precisely? How have they been “alienated” and where is the evidence? Are we forgetting the famed “mullah-military” complex and the assertion that Pakistan’s religious elite is usually in bed with its establishment? There is little doubt that the history of combined Punjab and its three main communities – Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs – is deeply troubled and discomforting. But the symbolic breakthroughs made by Pakistan recently are far from causing any major resistance or receiving any noticeable threats because they have a very powerful backing.
The opening paragraph uses a video of young students struggling with Punjabi and makes a passing comment on the Punjabi’s troubles. Firstly, the receding cover of Punjabi in Pakistan is not just because of the state’s preference for Urdu but also Punjab’s colonial legacy, its bloody partition and lack of education at large.
Secondly, the movement for Punjabi revivalism is local, indigenous and revolves around the promotion of its language and culture. The state is not supporting this movement and the regular Punjabi activist has no business with “deepening faultlines in India.” We are trying to save the culture and language of our ancestors from extinction.
The Pakistani establishment is indeed riding high on the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. One can indeed interpret it as an attempt to forward some of its old strategic objectives on Pakistan’s eastern border. But opening this corridor or planting Ranjit Singh’s statue in Lahore’s Shahi Qila is not the equivalent of promoting Punjabi culture or Punjabi identity, which we also call Punjabiyat, or Sikhism by any stretch of the imagination. Punjabi culture, as well as Punjabiyat, are much older and larger concepts that Sikhism is a part of. Please don’t swap these terms with each other. Again, even endorsing Sikhism or discussing the former Sikh empire is not the same as promoting Punjabiyat or Punjabi culture. This shows the author’s sheer lack of understanding – misintention perhaps – of both Indian and Pakistani Punjab.
The author quotes Dr Ali Usman Qasmi, one of leading voices favouring Punjabi in Pakistani academia and an organiser of the pioneering Punjabi conference in Lahore University of Management Sciences: “An Islam-based identity with Urdu as its flagship has made such massive inroads that the successive generation of Punjabi activists has found it difficult to counter it”.
I disagree with this statement by Dr Qasmi. This is not the front we need to fight on. Although a majority of the clerics have a strong command on Urdu, if you go to inner-city Lahore or the famed shrine of Hazrat Ali Hajveri in the heart of the city – Punjabi is used to preach, sing praises of the holy Prophet and even written material is made available. Countering Urdu is not the issue here, countering extremist mindset in Pakistan is the real challenge. So far, no extremist religious group has issued threats to Punjabi activists or organisations.
The main resistance in the adoption Punjabi as a lingua franca in Punjab has come from Punjabis themselves who rightly believe that investing time and money on Punjabi will not pay off. Unlike Urdu and English, only a handful of universities have Punjabi departments and since Punjabi is not taught at the school level, there are few other jobs that utilise this linguistic prowess. The official languages are Urdu and English, and they are rigorously taught. Language activists often argue that if Punjabi and classical poets of Punjabi like Bulleh Shah, Mian Muhammad Baksh, and others were taught as part of the curriculum, their enlightened thoughts will counter the prevalent religious intolerance in Pakistan.
Lastly, a reason for this lack of threat to the movement for Punjabi is that the movement has been slow to catch up. However, one must state here that significant progress has been made. Since 2010, Punjabi language activists have been protesting on Mother Language Day and demanding that, like the other three provinces in Pakistan, primary education should be in Punjabi. Universities like Government College University, LUMS, Kinnaird College and Lahore have recently established Punjabi departments or have started offering it as a subject. The bill will soon be tabled in the Parliament and we are lobbying intensely for it. We expect resistance eventually, but so far, no powerful lobby, no “conservative” or Islamist group worth their salt have challenged us.
The girls you see struggling to speak in Punjabi are from one of the few private schools that have allowed Punjabi to be taught. They are still young, learning fast and many of them are passionate about carrying this baton forward. The language is taking baby steps to cover decades of discrimination. Since this is an “elite school”, as the article rightly mentions, we expect these students to hold powerful positions later in life and remember their lessons in Punjabi when they make speeches in public or the Parliament. Many of these students struggle initially but gain fluency within months. When the course started nearly a decade ago, parents were shocked and reluctant. But now, it is a matter of pride in their posh drawing room conversations. This video is a fruit of our passionate activism. Try to appreciate it from Oxford. – Ammara Ahmad
I had deliberately kept the original title as “decoding the new punjabiyat” to make it sound different as the new title does have a somewhat threatening tone. I thank Ammara for the elaborate response. I hope the response is communicated to her. Her statements make personal remarks, such as the word “misintention”, rather than giving an academic criticism.
She asked which “conservative” groups precisely? Answer: Speeches by Khadim Hussain Rizvi, whose party won 4% vote share in Pakistan’s recent elections and got two provincial Assembly seats from Sindh, and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who declared the Kartarpur corridor as Qadiani corridor. One cannot get away by claiming these groups are fringe or irrelevant entities, especially Maulana’s JUI whose pre-2018 elections political prowess needs no introduction. The same goes for Khadim Rizvi’s November 2017 showdown.
I did not write Punjabi is under threat in its entirety but only certain of its aspects, such as the mainstreaming of Hindi as the official language has competed with other smaller dialects to their detriment in India, Urdu’s institutionalisation has its tale to offer.
On the politicisation aspect, could Ms Ammara answer what was the need to display an unexploded bomb in the Gurudwara premises, along with a signboard stating the IAF intended to destroy the Gurudwara in 1971? Add to this a promotional video of Kartarpur featuring Mr Bhindranwale. Here is a link to the Indian Foreign Office’s briefing protesting on the video.
Ms Ammara’s efforts are deeply appreciated and I wish her all the success.But let us not ignore the fact that Indo-Pak rivalry spills out in myriad ways, one of which I highlighted. I have gone to the extent of quoting how both nations tap each others’ diasporas to do useless propaganda activities. My article only addresses how two rival nation states engage with issues with multidimensional effects. – Prateek Joshi

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI - At least 43 people were killed Sunday in a devastating fire that ripped through a bag factory in the congested old quarter of the Indian capital New Delhi, with survivors describing the screams of workers trapped inside.Police and fire officials said they had rescued at least 58 people and did not expect to find more bodies.The blaze was the worst in Delhi since 59 movie-goers died in a cinema in 1997.The cause of the blaze is not yet known, but the city's poor planning and lax enforcement of building and safety codes have often been blamed for such deadly incidents.The building's owner and manager were arrested Sunday, police told the Press Trust of India news agency.Tearful relatives spoke of receiving desperate calls from factory workers begging to be saved from the inferno in the poorly lit premises in the commercial hub of Sadar Bazar. The fire started around 5:00 am (23:30 GMT Saturday).A man named Musharaff who was trapped inside the four-story structure made a desperate phone call to ask that his children be looked after."Monu, brother, I am going to die today," he said in the recording of a call played by the ABP Hindi language news channel."Please take care of my kids. I can't breathe. There are so many others here. Just can't breathe," he kept repeating in Hindi, before finally breaking down.Authorities said they do not know if Musharaff was among the survivors.One man who did survive, Sabi Abbas, told AFP he had just finished work and was about to go to sleep in the factory's modest sleeping quarters when he heard screams from the third floor."I rushed to the floor and saw the wires were dangling and on fire as acrid smoke filled up the corridor," he said, adding that he ran out of the building with his wife and daughters.Such factories often provide sleeping quarters for poor workers, mostly migrant, who save money by bedding down at their workplaces.The building was home to several manufacturing units producing items including schoolbags and packing materials, which fueled the spread of the blaze, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that the fire was "extremely horrific."Authorities promised they would provide financial assistance to victims' families and survivors.Locals said the factory, which also made purses and jackets, had just one entrance; 20 rooms on each floor were connected by a single internal stairway."Most of the casualties happened because of suffocation," witness Mohammed Khalil told AFP."After the fire, people didn't have any way to get out, and I believe many were asleep and because of the smoke, they got suffocated."Others told AFP they believed the fire started on the first floor, sparked by exposed wires, before spreading to an area where foam and plastic chairs were stored.Anxious relatives and friends gathered outside a nearby hospital morgue to identify the bodies.Naushad Ahmad was looking desperately for a missing friend, whom he was unable to reach on his mobile phone."I have been to the factory and this tragedy was waiting to happen," he told AFP."There was only one exit and entrance to the building... People didn't get a chance to escape."After searching for his father-in-law and brother-in-law for two hours, Sajjamuddin Ahmad discovered they were dead, he told AFP.Families of the victims said they were mostly migrant workers from Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states. Some of them were paid just 1,000 rupees ($14) a month, they said.The site had been operating without required fire safety clearances, Delhi's fire services director told the Press Trust of India.The news agency also said that more than 150 firefighters battled for nearly five hours to put out the blaze. -AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Karnataka By-polls Results: 11 rebels labelled defectors by their parties win again on BJP seats</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bengaluru, Dec 09: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka retained majority in the Karnataka Assembly after 11 of the 13 Congress and JD(S) turncoats that the saffron had fielded managed to retain power in the state.
Congress won two seats, Janata Dal Secular (JDS) drew a blank while a BJP rebel won as an Independent candidate.
Jarkiholi Ramesh Laxmanrao, who spearheaded Operation Lotus leading to the fall of the H D Kumaraswamy government managed to win the Gokak seat again for the BJP.
Likewise, Arabail Hebbar Shivaram, Mahesh Iranagouda Kumathalli, K Sudhakar, BA Basavaraja, and ST Somashekar won from Yellapur,Athani, Chikkaballapur, KR Pura and Yeshwanthpur constituencies respectively.
Meanwhile, Anand Singh won the Vijayanagara seat for the BJP again.
The twp rebel leaders who failed to win their seats were N Nagaraju (MTB) and Adaguru H Vishwanath.
Chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who engineered the Congress-JDS rebellion, reiterated that the disqualified legislators who win will be made ministers in his Cabinet.
"They (disqualified MLAs) sacrificed for us. We've promised to make them ministers. There's no question of going back on this promise," Yediyurappa said.
To a question, if the disqualified legislators, who lost the bypolls, will be made ministers, Yediyurappa said "I don't want to discuss this now. In the coming days, we will discuss this with the Central leadrship."
Among the 15 constituencies going for polls, 12 were represented by Congress and three by JD(S).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KERRY TD Michael Healy-Rae is being treated in hospital for suspected smoke inhalation after a fire was detected at his property.
The incident occurred at 9am this morning at the politician's Kilgarvan property.
It is understood Mr Healy-Rae was at home pending travelling to Dublin for Dail business.
A fire was detected at the Kilgarvan shop which also serves as Mr Healy-Rae's office and political base.

His office is the rear of the shop previously operated by his father.
He lives around 200m away.
Mr Healy-Rae raced to ensure the property was empty after realising a fire had broken out.
The local fire brigade were immediately alerted.
It is understood the TD was checking that the property was empty and was attempting to save a number of important files when he was partially overcome by smoke.
He was treated at the scene by a doctor before the decision was taken to transfer him to hospital for precautionary tests.
A local ambulance brought him to Kerry hospital.
He is expected to make a full recovery.
Speaking to Independent.ie, his brother Danny Healy-Rae said Michael would be okay.
"He will be fine. He has been taken to hospital as a precaution. They want to give him an x-ray," he said.
An investigation into the cause of the blaze is underway but the belief is that the fire was accidental.
The fire was quickly extinguished by Kerry Fire Brigade.
Four years ago, Mr Healy-Rae narrowly avoided serious injury when he was attacked by a cow on the family farm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Re-run: APC aspirants demand redeployment of REC, top Akwa Ibom INEC officials</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The All Progressives Congress, APC, Aspirants Forum, APCAF, Akwa Ibom state chapter has demanded the redeployment of the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Mike Igini and principal officials at the state Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as the commission prepares to conduct court-ordered rerun elections in Essien Udim local government.
Addressing newsmen in Uyo at the weekend on behalf of the Forum, the state Coordinator, an APC aspirant for the Etinan/Nsit Ubium/Nsit Ibom Federal constituency seat in the 2019 election, Dr Chris Enoch expressed lack of trust and confidence in the electoral umpire under the watch of Igini to conduct the re-run elections without bias.
Enoch alleged that the Commission’s preferential treatment of the PDP and its stakeholders played out during the pre-election meetings of the stakeholders, adding that Igini’s post-election utterances demonstrated his inert hatred and disgust for the APC and its principal actors particularly Senator Godswill Akpabio.
He stressed, “It is worthy of note that on the heels of the Appeal Court judgement on the case of Senator Godswill Akpabio, the candidate of APC in the 2019 election for Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial district in which Akpabio got a favourable ruling, the spokesperson of INEC Akwa Ibom state as directed by Igini, issued a press statement in which Akpabio was vilified and frontally accused of having sponsored thuggery during the election.
“Such a wild accusation smacks of a devilish agenda to poison the minds of the electorates against Akpabio in his local government, Essien Udim in which the rerun has been ordered by the appellate court and which is strategic to Akpabio’s victory and his final emergence as the Senator for the senatorial district.
“INEC’s strategy in that press release is simply pre-emptive and to spoil things for Akpabio. This further buttress the believe that INEC, Akwa Ibom state holds Senator Akpabio in utter disdain and opprobrium”
The APCAF state Coordinator maintained that the statement by INEC was also a glaring prelude for biased conduct of the rerun election in favour of Akpabio’s opponent.
He explained that in advanced democracies gallant losers and magnanimous victors emerge at the end of electoral contest only in a seamless, rancour-free contest impartially supervised by an unbiased and uncompromised umpire guided by the rules of the game, personal morals and ethics.
“No sane institution would allow Igini and his top echelon of officials at the Akwa Ibom State INEC to conduct further elections in Akwa Ibom state, particularly if any APC candidate is involved in the contest. We are saying if this same crop of people are allowed to conduct the rerun election we cannot expect any positive outcome from that exercise.
“As an electoral umpire, you are supposed to remain neutral. We, therefore recommend that due and commensurate action should be taken by INEC headquarters, Abuja to inculcate some noble sense of patriotism and transparency in Mr Igini.
“On the basis of foregoing incontrovertible facts and observations, therefore, we members of APC Aspirants Forum, Akwa Ibom state chapter call for the immediate redeployment of Mr Igini and the posting of a new and impartial REC and INEC principal staff to Akwa Ibom such as would inspire confidence in the electorates preparatory to the conduct of a free fair, and acceptable rerun elections”, he stated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disabled mother, 51, and her nine-year-old autistic son face a homeless Christmas after Hoover tumble dryer blaze destroyed their flat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A disabled mother-of-one and her nine-year-old autistic son are facing Christmas without a home after their tumble dryer went up in flames destroying 'everything they owned'.
Lisa Camilleri, from Shenley, Hertfordshire, was waiting for the three-year-old Hoover dryer to finish its cycle last month when she heard a 'loud bang' and her electricity tripped.
The 51-year-old rushed to her kitchen in the dark before sensing 'glowing' flames behind her. She watched in horror as flames erupted from behind the appliance.  
Ms Camilleri panicked and quickly dialled 999 before running out into the street wearing just her pyjamas and slippers.
By the time the fire service arrived 10 minutes later, her flat had been engulfed in flames and she had 'lost everything.'  
Now the disabled mother faces a 'bleak' Christmas alone as her son Alfie has had to go and stay with his aunt, and she has been moved to temporary accommodation.  
Ms Camilleri has urged others to check their home insurance because she is only getting £5,000 of the £12,500 she desperately needs after failing to keep his list of contents updated.
She said: 'It's very traumatic. Everything has been damaged - most of my flat.
'I've had to get something to help me to sleep because I'm suffering with PTSD. I smell fire and burning everywhere I go. I wake up at night and I hear that bang.
'I've lost everything, but I just thank the Lord I managed to get out. Luckily Alfie wasn't there. Christmas this year is looking bleak.'
Ms Camilleri had owned the dryer for three years and had never had any issues with it until it set on fire in early November.
She said: 'When I first walked [into the kitchen], I didn't even look at the dryer but I could feel something glowing behind me.
'Then I turned around and all I could see were orange flames coming from the back of it.
'I just stood there looking at it. Panic set in and there was smoke, then the windows blew out.
'I managed to get out of the house. I struggled to get the door open, luckily I did, then I called the fire brigade.
'They managed to put out the fire but it had already taken hold of the flat.
'The only door that was closed was my little boy Alfie's bedroom. That's not too bad - it's salvageable.
'I've got to salvage as much as I can because I'd under-insured myself. I'd forgotten to update it when I bought new stuff.
'I have to save my leather sofa and chairs from the smoke damage, my bed, that's got smoke all over it. And Alfie's stuff too.'
Ms Camilleri has now been out of her home for more than a month and is living separately from Alfie to save him from the trauma, as he struggles to adapt to changes due to his suspected autism.
Although her housing association have given her a temporary flat, she claims they refuse to carpet it - leaving her to walk on bare floorboards.
Ms Camilleri said: 'They've found me a temporary house which I'm starting to move into now, but they won't let me stay here [for the future].
'That's the worst thing about it - I cannot go back to my flat, it's too traumatising.
'They won't carpet the new place or anything like that. They said it's not in their policy.
'Alfie's diagnosed with severe anxiety and is waiting to be assessed for autism. He's got a two-year learning delay.
'He won't step foot in this new [temporary accommodation] place until it's absolutely spotless, because any sign of dirt and he goes crazy. All his stuff that I can save needs to be put in place for him.
'It's just so hard. I'm trying to do my best by mopping the floorboards and he's staying with my daughter at the moment.
'I'm expecting to stay here for months, depending on the work needed. There's so much work to be done [on my flat].
'Luckily, I have a supportive family who have been doing as much as they can.'
Ms Camilleri claims she reported the fire to Hoover and was told she needed to go through her insurance.
However, after moving house years earlier, she had taken out home insurance but forgotten to update it as she bought new things for the flat.
Because she was under-insured, Lisa will receive just 42 percent of what is needed to replace her damaged belongings.
The stay-at-home mother and Alfie face a long journey ahead as they try to find £7,000 to repair their flat.
She said: 'The insurance are paying less for my contents because I was under-insured.
'I just hope people read this and remember to keep their contents insurance updated. So many people forget - exactly like I did.'
Hoover claimed they could find no record of Lisa's call to them and said they were informed of the incident by the retailer.
A spokesperson for Hoover said: 'The retailer informed us of the incident on 11th November 2019 and, as per our protocols, contacted the customer to organise inspection of the appliance. 
'We were told that the product had already been taken away on 8th November so unfortunately we have been unable to undertake our own investigation.
'Whilst we sympathise with Ms Camilleri's situation, we are unable to shed any further light on this particular incident as we have been unable to inspect the appliance ourselves. 
'We would of course like to once the customer's insurance company has been in touch and the product is made available to us.
'We would however like to take the opportunity to reiterate that all Hoover appliances conform to all required EU quality and safety requirements and we can confirm that there have been no safety notices on this product.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">APC Invented Hate Speech In Nigeria, Ruling Party Chieftain Admits</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Joshua Alobo, has claimed that his party originated hate speech.
Alobo who is also a human rights advocate was speaking in a reaction to the re-arrest of the Convener of the RevolutionNow Omoyele Sowore.
Sowore who was released on bail by the DSS on Thursday last week was re-arrested in a courtroom by the DSS the following day.
According to the APC chieftain, what the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari interprets as hate speech originated from the APC.
He admitted that he was “seriously embarrassed” by the treatment meted out to Sowore who was “among those who canvassed for the ‘change’ mantra.”
Alobo told Channel TV’s Sunrise Daily, Monday, that  “APC, in which I am a chieftain, originated hate speech.
“Look at what happened at… even Lai Muhammed and the rest, nobody was arrested. Look at the fuel subsidy protest at the freedom square.
“If not that Jonathan was proactive to deploy soldiers…I was in Abuja; even though I wasn’t in the general protest, I was using my vehicle to monitor the whole situation.
“So a lot of showbiz was going on during the Jonathan administration, they don’t look at it as a threat to the government. What is Sowore?
“They are just making the guy to[sic] be too popular, I don’t know him as a person. But they have been reading Sahara Reporters right from Jonathan era, a lot of information has been disclosed and all those things.
Alobo, President of the International Human Rights and Development Centre asked: “So if a media practitioner cannot express his opinion, then what will he do?
“And this is a man that has the pedigree of activism right from University. So, the DSS for goodness sake should not bring another terrorist group.
“It is the suppression of Yusuf Muhammed that escalated into what we have now as Boko Haram.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nairobi governor pleads not guilty to graft charges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nairobi’s governor pleaded not guilty to corruption and other economic crimes involving millions of dollars in a Kenyan court on Monday.
Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko was arrested on Friday and is accused of conspiracy to commit corruption, failure to comply with laws related to procurement, unlawful acquisition of public property and laundering the proceeds of crime.
Chief public prosecutor Noordin Haji has accused Sonko and his associates of the misappropriation of 357 million Kenyan shillings ($3.52 million).
Kenyans and investors have long complained of corruption in Kenya, East Africa’s business hub and the region’s richest economy. President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to crack down on the problem.
Sonko appeared before anti-corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti dressed in a designer shirt sequined with a gold teddy bear under a hooded camouflage jacket.
Police set up barriers on streets around the court and diverted traffic in anticipation of possible trouble after Sonko’s supporters called for protests.
Sonko, a member of Kenyatta’s ruling Jubilee Party, said in a statement on Sunday that his arrest was politically motivated and that he was a law-abiding citizen.
He urged his supporters to avoid any actions that “may threaten the peace”.
“What I ask of you, my supporters is to pray for me. Even all my haters, please pray for me,” the statement, written partly in English and partly in KiSwahili, read.
Sonko was represented in court by a high profile team of Kenyan lawyers including the Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen.
The former senator is a flamboyant figure, known for his glitzy lifestyle, flashy clothes, chunky gold jewelry, and eye-catching hairstyles.
Police used teargas to disperse hundreds of Sonko’s supporters when he was called into the anti-corruption office for questioning in November, as reported by Reuters.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">

In the era of social media and instant messaging, the courts are constantly challenged to develop the common law to accommodate the ever-changing environment. Recently, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) was asked to pronounce on whether a WhatsApp message, in which a man indicated he would pay each of his children R1 million if he won R20 million, gave rise to an enforceable contract.
It transpired that the appellant, Mr Ntsieni Kgopana, actually won R20,814,582 in the National Lottery (Lotto). When questioned about his winnings by the respondent, who is the mother of one of the appellant’s seven children, the appellant denied that he had won the Lotto and sent her a WhatsApp message saying: “If I get 20m I can give all my children 1m and remain with 13m…”
When the respondent obtained proof that the appellant had, in fact, won the Lotto, she relied on the appellant’s WhatsApp message to claim payment of the R1 million for her minor child.
The high court found that the WhatsApp message constituted a binding agreement and ordered the appellant to pay the amount owed to the mother of his child.
However, on December 2 2019, the SCA overturned the high court’s decision and held that the WhatsApp message did not contain an offer that could, on acceptance thereof, be converted into an enforceable agreement. In interpreting the message, the SCA held that the context strongly suggested that the appellant never intended to agree to part with a portion of his winnings and that the message simply relayed what the appellant could do in the hypothetical future event of him receiving R20 million.
Even though the SCA found in the present case that the WhatsApp message was not a binding contract, it does not mean that a WhatsApp message can never give rise to binding legal obligations.
As a general rule, there are no prescribed formalities for the conclusion of a contract. All that is required is an offer and an acceptance, and consequently, consensus between the contracting parties. It is also important to note that acceptance of an offer need not be expressed in words, as it can also be established by conduct, from which the inference of acceptance can logically be drawn.
Individuals must, therefore, exercise caution when negotiating or making offers online and via instant messaging as those expressions could create legally binding agreements.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Official: Base shooter watched shooting videos before attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PENSACOLA, Fla. — The Saudi student who fatally shot three sailors at a U.S. naval base in Florida hosted a dinner party earlier in the week where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Saturday.
Officials investigating the deadly attack were working Saturday to determine whether it was motivated by terrorism, while President Donald Trump indicated he would review policies governing foreign military training in the United States.
The Navy on Saturday identified the three victims and hailed them as heroes for trying to stop the shooter and flagging down first responders after being shot.
“The Sailors that lost their lives in the line of duty and showed exceptional heroism and bravery in the face of evil," Capt. Tim Kinsella, the commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola, said in a statement. “When confronted, they didn’t run from danger; they ran towards it and saved lives."
The shooter opened fire inside a classroom at the naval base on Friday, killing three people and wounding two sheriff's deputies, one in the arm and one in the knee, before one of the deputies killed him. Eight others were also hurt. Both deputies were expected to survive.
The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.
Ten Saudi students were being held on the base Saturday while several others were unaccounted for, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities.
The FBI identified the shooter in a statement Saturday night as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21. Investigators said he was a 2nd Lt. in the Royal Saudi Air Force and was a student naval flight officer of Naval Aviation Schools Command. A U.S. official on Friday said the FBI was examining social media posts and investigating whether he acted alone or was connected to any broader group. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
Two U.S. officials said Friday that authorities were investigating whether the attack was terrorism-related. They spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose information that had not yet been made public.
In remarks at a gathering of top U.S. defense and military officials on Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper was asked whether he could say definitively that the shooting was an act of terrorism.
“No, I can’t say it’s terrorism at this time,” he said, adding that the investigation needs to proceed. He declined to discuss details of the investigation so far.
President Trump also declined to say whether the shooting was terrorism-related. The president tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims on Friday and noted that Saudi King Salman had reassured him in a telephone call that the shooter “in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people."
But in comments echoing those made earlier by Esper, Trump said Saturday that he would review policies governing foreign military training in the U.S.
The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. Currently, more than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the U.S. going through military training.
“This has been done for many decades,” Trump said. “I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately."
Speaking at the Ronald Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, on Saturday, Esper and others downplayed any initial impact on U.S.-Saudi ties.
Asked whether he would now hesitate to send U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia, he said, “No, not at all.” He said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have shared security interests, especially with regard to Iran.
The shooting has shined a light on the sometimes rocky relationship between the two countries, however.
The kingdom is still trying to recover from the killing last year of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi intelligence officials and a forensic doctor killed and dismembered Khashoggi on Oct. 2, 2018, just as his fiancée waited outside the diplomatic mission.
Naval Air Station Pensacola is one of the Navy's most historic and storied bases. It sprawls along the waterfront southwest of the city's downtown and dominates the economy of the surrounding area.
Part of the base resembles a college campus, with buildings where, in addition to foreign students, 60,000 members of the U.S. Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard train each year in multiple fields of aviation.
Kinsella said the base would remain closed until further notice.
Residents of Pensacola mourned the attacks and offered their condolences to affected members of the community.
Family members on Saturday identified one of the victims as a 23-year-old recent graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who alerted first responders to where the shooter was even after he had been shot several times.
“Joshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own," his older brother Adam Watson wrote on Facebook. “He died a hero and we are beyond proud."
A second victim was identified as Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Haitham's mother, Evelyn Brady, herself a Navy veteran, said the commander of her son's school called her and told her Haitham had tried to stop the shooter.
The former track and field star had been assigned to flight crew training and was looking forward to graduating from the program later this month, Brady said.
“He said he was going to get his flight jacket for Christmas,” she said. “Now that’s not going to happen.”
The Navy identified the third victim as Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia. All three were students at Naval Aviation Schools Command.
The shooting is the second at a U.S. naval base in one week. A sailor whose submarine was docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, opened fire on three civilian employees Wednesday, killing two before taking his own life.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in a suicide attack in southern Helmand province on Monday, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) said in a statement.
The attack took place about 10am local time after a suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives close to a security checkpoint in Nad Ali district, the statement said.
“The security forces identified the bomber and starting shooting at the truck, but the bomber detonated his explosive,” it said.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bolton Muslim Girls School can expand to take extra 150 pupils</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best-performing school in Bolton is set to expand by 150 pupils over the next five years as plans for its future have been approved.
Bolton Muslim Girls School has been granted planning permission to build a four-storey side extension.
The school, which will increase its student numbers from 600 to 750, can now also use the second and third floors of the mill building it is located in for educational purposes.
The expansion will allow the school to add design and technology as well as drama to its curriculum.
Work at the site is due to start in January and an additional intake of 30 pupils per year is planned.
Deputy head Helen Andiyapan warned delays to the expansion of the “oversubscribed” school would put £2.2m of funding at risk.
She said: “There will be a local shortage of places if this expansion does not go ahead. We are aware of the concerns raised and have tried our utmost to address these in the best nature possible.”
The planning committee approved the application last week despite residents raising concerns about increased traffic in the area.
Hanif Kola spoke on behalf of residents objecting to the proposal at a town hall meeting on Thursday.
He said that residents had tried to be fair and take a “balanced” approach with the school, but concerns had “fallen on deaf ears”.
They asked for each class to have an assigned entrance to ease congestion and demanded this becomes school policy so that it can be enforced.
He said: “We support the school and its efforts to expand its teaching provision but to have one access and entry point for a further 150 students is a major health and safety issue for the school, medical centre and the residents which cannot be compromised or overlooked in any way.”
Rumworth councillor Shamim Abdullah, who requested that the planning committee discusses the plans and makes the final decision, said that residents in her ward felt that the roads around the school cannot cope with traffic as it is.
However, she was satisfied that the school had taken appropriate measures to mitigate these problems.
Cllr Elaine Sherrington said: “The difficulty with the school is the fact that it is in an old mill. It was never designed to be a school and it’s in one of the most built up areas in the town.
“At the end of the day, the school is where it is and there’s nothing we can do about that.

“I think if we talk about expansion in the future, I don’t think we can go over five-storeys.
“At that stage I think they would have to look at a brand new site.”
Plans were passed unanimously.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Johannesburg - Former anti-apartheid activist and economics professor Ben Turok had died, his family confirmed on Monday morning.
Turok died in the early hours of Monday morning, his family said in a statement. He was 92. 
“The Turok family are very sad to announce the passing of Ben Turok, their much-loved husband, father, uncle, grandfather and great grandfather, in the early hours of Monday, December 9, aged 92.
"He was always outspoken and dedicated his whole life to fighting for freedom, equality and social justice in South Africa. He was a loyal, lifetime member of the ANC, but retained an independent perspective throughout."
The family said Turok had asked for his death to be marked by a private ceremony "rather than anything official or formal, in view of the present predicament facing the country".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Gauteng government has revealed a multibillion-rand strategy to restore the dignity of children and the poor in the province.
On Sunday, acting MEC for Social Development and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi announced Gauteng’s anti-poverty strategy to eliminate urban hunger and inequality.
“The strategy will protect the poor, the weak and vulnerable by providing solid services that will move them from dependency to independence.
“It will remove some beneficiaries from relying on social grants to work opportunities within government projects,” said Lesufi.
The strategy would start immediately with protecting children, especially those in child-headed families. Lesufi said the strategy aimed to benefit about 160000 children with 20000 children targeted this festive season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cardinal Tagle gets new Vatican post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pope Francis has named Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle as the new Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.
Tagle’s appointment was announced in Rome, Italy on Sunday noon (7 p.m. Manila time), said a Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines News post.
He will replace Cardinal Fernando Filoni who was appointed as the new Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher.
Tagle’s appointment marks the return of an Asian cardinal to the leadership of the important congregation for evangelization after Indian Cardinal Ivan Dias who served from 2006 to 2011.
The Vatican News said the Pope “once again shows great attention to the Asian continent.”  The announcement was made near the end of his trip to Thailand and Japan. Tagle will be installed at the Vatican early next year.
Tagle, 62, was ordained priest for the Diocese of Imus in 1982. Saint John Paul II named him bishop of the diocese in 2001. In October 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Archbishop of Manila, and as cardinal in 2012.
He has been serving as president of Caritas Internationalis, the Vatican’s social action arm since 2015.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jo Swinson reveals she has been advised to wear 'lower cut tops' amid fears that the Lib Dem campaign is failing to win over voters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson today revealed she has been urged to wear lower cut tops to boost her party's electoral chances.
Ms Swinson said the extraordinary tip was among a welter of 'unsolicited advice' she has received on how to revive her flagging campaign.
Fears have been mounting that the Lib Dems are failing to win over voters, with the party's 'hard Remain' stance and a Labour squeeze blamed for a slump in the polls.
But Ms Swinson's own personal ratings have also been dire, now rivalling Jeremy Corbyn at the bottom of the charts.  
Pressed on BBC Breakfast today over what she could do to turn the situation around, Ms Swinson said people had been urging her to speak and dress differently.  
She said: 'I get lots and lots of unsolicited advice. I'm not short of people telling me that I should speak differently or wear different shoes or wear different earrings. 
'Or in one case, somebody suggested that I should wear lower cut tops. 
'I mean as if that's going to be the thing that changes the poll rating. I'm not short of unsolicited advice.' 
Asked if the 'advice' was coming from her own election team, she said: 'Not in my election team, but as I say, I do get these gems of advice that come to me. 
'I am who I am and some people will not like the way that I dress or talk or my accent or whatever. 
'And fine. In a sense that's their problem. I'm going to stand here, do the best that I can arguing for the positions that I believe in because I do believe our politics can be better. 
'And I'm going to be true to myself in the way I do it.' 
Ms Swinson came under fire at a Channel 4 debate last night in which a furious voter accused her of being a 'Tory in disguise'. 
A woman in the audience said: 'You're a Tory in disguise, state what you are. You dare to try and raise taxes on lower earners when the country is in austerity. How dare you.'
Ms Swinson replied to her critic by saying: 'And we need to end that [austerity] by investing in our public services and we need to be honest about how we do that.
'If you look at the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, they have looked at the Labour plan and they say they are not credible.'
The comeback saw shadow education secretary Angela Rayner launch into an angry tirade, yelling at the former coalition minister: 'You voted for the bedroom tax, you voted for austerity, you voted for tuition fees.
'You did that nine years ago - apologise for tuition fees.'
The Lib Dem leader responded by accusing Labour of 'making a list of promises that you cannot deliver'. 
Ms Swinson also brought up her cannabis use when asked to identify the 'naughtiest' thing she had ever done. 
'I did smoke a fair bit of cannabis at university,' she told PA. 'It wasn't just one, and I did inhale.
'I don't know whether that counts as particularly naughty, but your readers and viewers will be able to make up their own mind on that.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Probe underway into $3.3M fraud at Telenor bank</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Several employees at Telenor’s Pakistan-based Microfinance Bank were accused of helping scam the operation out of NOK30 million ($3.3 million), Norwegian business publication Dagens Naeringsliv reported.
Staff at the bank, which runs mobile money operation Easypaisa, are suspected of approving fake loan applications with external parties also implicated in the scam.
Although no specific details have been provided by either the operator or bank, the newspaper estimates more than 1,600 fraudulent loans had been processed since February 2017. The accused employees deny all charges.
Telenor’s operation in Pakistan is investigating and will report any further suspected fraudulent activity to the country’s police. On Saturday (7 December), several of the accused appeared at a preliminary hearing in Lahore, which was subsequently adjourned.
The operation is owned by Telenor and Alipay parent Ant Financial, after the latter purchased a 45 per cent stake in the venture in 2018 with a commitment to pump fresh funds into the business.
Its current fraud case refers to activity at just one of the 171 Telenor Microfinance branches, Pakistan Today reported, with activity at other offices also said to be under investigation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Halting demands for indyref2 once again at the heart of Scottish Tory campaign</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While three parties campaigned against independence in 2014, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw insists his is the only one that can now be relied upon to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon.
As they did under previous leader Ruth Davidson, the Tories have focused their campaign strategy around a defence of the Union.
Mr Carlaw is unashamed about this, saying: “Our message is stop indyref2, it is take on Nicola Sturgeon and make her focus on the appalling record of failure in Scotland’s public services.”
And with voters apparently believing Jeremy Corbyn would grant the SNP leader the second vote on independence that she craves, Mr Carlaw says his party are now winning over traditional Labour voters in the party’s former west of Scotland heartlands.
And despite Boris Johnson’s unpopularity – a recent poll have him a net approval rating in Scotland of -52 – Mr Carlaw says the Tories are getting a “fantastic response in certain key seats”.
He spoke of a “sense that the Conservative vote is holding firmly in Scotland”.
Mr Carlaw added: “There are other people, particularly old Labour unionists who are dismayed by what Corbyn is doing and saying who are thinking ‘I want to stop Nicola Sturgeon, how do I do it’.
“If you want to stop Nicola Sturgeon, I think in this election, the Conservatives who are now Scotland’s opposition party, are the party to do it.
“I’m getting feedback that we are having a fantastic response in certain key seats, particularly in the west of Scotland, where that old Labour unionist vote exists, those people are dismayed by what Jeremy Corbyn is doing.”
While the Tories united with Labour and the Liberal Democrats to fight to keep Scotland in the UK in the run up to the 2014 referendum, Mr Carlaw said five years on from that vote, “people have increasingly come to see that actually only one of those unionist parties can be relied upon to be firm and resolute in standing up for the Union”.
He added: “They believe Jeremy Corbyn is quite prepared to do a deal with Nicola Sturgeon on a second independence referendum if that gets him into Downing Street.
“They look at the Liberal Democrats….. but they have been quite confused in their messaging as the campaign has gone on, and their ratings have slumped.
“I think increasingly people are saying if I want to stop Nicola Sturgeon which party is going to do it, and there is only one, that’s the Scottish Conservatives, the party I am leading.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Okodili Ndidi, Abuja
 
Again troops have rescued thirty-one persons including fourteen women and seventeen children from a Boko Haram hideout in Malam Masari and Gabchari Villages in Bama Council Area of Borno State.
During the operation, one Boko Haram fighter was killed and all the terrorists’ enclaves within the area were destroyed.
It will be recalled that twelve women and four children were earlier rescued from the insurgents’ den along the Cameroonian border by troops who dislodged the terrorists during a recent operation.
The Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, also disclosed that one of the Boko Haram fighters, Abba Modu, voluntarily surrendered to troops of the 3 Battalion in Gamboru, Ngala Council Area of Borno State.
A statement signed by Iliyasu informed that “preliminary investigation revealed that he (Abba Modu) joined the sect in 2015 and was a member of Mamman Nur group. He also disclosed that he actively participated in rustling cattle for the sect”.
The statement continued that, “in yet another display of gallantry and patriotism, the combined troops of 68/94 Battalions of Operation LAFIYA DOLE deployed at Malam Fatori in Abadam LGA of Borno State conducted an aggressive fighting patrol to a location earlier reported by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE as harbouring some activities of the Boko Haram criminal elements.
“The troops successfully uncovered the enclave and proceeded to engage it with devastating volumes of fire. Without any attempt to return fire, the cowardly criminals scampered into the nearby bushes in complete disarray. Subsequently, the troops immediately embarked on an exploitation of this success by pursuing them along their withdrawal route. During the said exploitation, troops discovered the body of one Boko Haram terrorist and further observed several trails of blood along the said route.
“Additionally, 2 AK 47 Rifles, 2 AK 47 Rifle magazines loaded with 30 rounds of 7.62mm Special ammunition each, 3 unexploded Mortar bombs for making of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were captured from the insurgents. Other items equally captured include, one bundle of IED cable, one IED battery, one camel bag, 3 motorcycles, 3 sets of overall cloths, bedding materials, cooking utensils, food items, motorcycle spare parts, 122 cylinder tubes and various mechanical tools”.
Iliyasu stressed further that, “in a related development that occurred on 3 December 2019, the criminal Boko Haram elements suffered a similar defeat in the hands of the troops of 144 Battalion deployed at Limankara in Gwoza LGA of Borno State during a failed attempt to infiltrate the troops’ location.
” During the exploitation exercise that followed the brief firefight with the marauding criminals, the troops discovered burnt body parts of 3 Boko Haram criminals hit by a Rocket Propelled Grenade bomb explosion as well as some broken AK 47 Rifle parts and traces of blood along the criminals’ withdrawal route.
“Furthermore, on 3 December 2019, troops of 101 Task Force Battalion deployed at Cross Kauwa in Kukawa LGA of Borno State made contact with some marauding Boko Haram criminals while conducting Clearance Operations along Cross Kauwa – Monguno Road. The visibly shaken Boko Haram criminals who evidently couldn’t stand the troops superiority fled for safety. Nevertheless, the unrelenting troops went on a hot pursuit and arrested two of the criminals. In another development that occurred on 4 December 2019, troops of 68/94 Battalions deployed at Malam Fatori in Abadam LGA of Borno State conducted a successful ambush at a Boko Haram criminals crossing point North East of the town and neutralised one Boko Haram criminal while many others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.
“However, the troops recovered some vandalised roofing sheets, 33 IED detonator cords and other IED making materials. Preliminary investigation revealed that the criminals are part of IED laying party along the route.
“In another successful ambush operation conducted by the troops of 21 Special Armoured Brigade on 4 December 2019, at Darel Jamel, Bama LGA of Borno State, the troops neutralised one Boko Haram terrorist while several others escaped with gunshot wounds. Same troops also conducted a robust clearance operation same day and cleared Boko Haram criminals’ hideouts at Mantari, Malam Masari and Gabchari Villages in Bama LGA of Borno State. During the Operation, troops neutralised one Boko Haram criminal and destroyed all discovered terrorists’ enclaves within the area. It is gratifying to note that, the troops also rescued 31 persons comprising 14 women and 17 children from the insurgents.
“The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai has, therefore, commended the troops for the exceptional display of gallantry, professionalism and responsiveness. He, however, admonishes them to remain resilient and continue to mount pressure on the Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) criminal elements as their end is obviously in sight”.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA - Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and eight of his cabinet ministers will be in Ottawa today as part of a trip to meet their federal counterparts.
Kenney will speak at the Canadian Club this afternoon and later host a reception.
He is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday to discuss issues ranging from pipelines to equalization.
Kenney has said he will bring up with Trudeau a resolution passed unanimously at the recent meeting of provincial leaders to consider changes to the fiscal stabilization fund.
The fund helps provinces facing year-over-year declines in non-resource revenues, but Alberta says it is being shortchanged due to caps tied to the size of its population.
Kenney says Alberta should receive about $2.4 billion going back to 2014, and that the federal government is open to discussing the proposal.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO - The official portrait of Ontario's first female premier is set to be unveiled at the legislature later today.
TVO reports that Kathleen Wynne's picture was done by artist Linda Kooluris-Dobbs, who also painted the official portraits of former premier David Peterson and former lieutenant-governor Hal Jackman.
Wynne became premier in 2013 after winning the Liberal leadership following her predecessor Dalton McGuinty's resignation.
She took the party from a minority government to a majority one in 2014, but after a few years her popularity sharply declined and the Liberals were reduced to third place -- not enough for official party status in the legislature -- in the 2018 election.
Wynne introduced many popular policies, such as ones to fight climate change, free tuition for low-income students and an increase to the minimum wage, but was widely criticized over quickly rising electricity rates, the partial privatization of Hydro One, and plunging the province back into deficit.
Wynne's north Toronto seat was one of the few the Liberals retained in the last election, and she continues to sit as a member of provincial parliament.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">
President Cyril Ramaphosa, 22 August 2019. Picture: Gallo Images
This week’s edition of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s weekly letters to the nation, “From the Desk of the President”, has left a bitter taste in the mouth of many, based on the reactions on social media.
In the letter, Ramaphosa calls power station Medupi “a fitting symbol of the importance of our state-owned enterprises”.
“Despite the depth of current challenges, none of our SOEs is lost. They can all be saved. But it will take extraordinary effort and, in some cases, tough decisions,” the president writes.
Harsh criticism online came from people including journalists Ferial Haffajee, Ray Mahlaka, and Erin Bates, political analyst Daniel Silke, and activist Zackie Achmat.
Both Mahlaka and Bates described the president’s letter as “tone-deaf”.
“The number one citizen gloating about a serially late and budget-blowing Medupi Power Station. Gloating about a looting scheme,” Mahlaka tweeted.
“No mention of how his administration plans to yank the country out of darkness in the interim. So tone-deaf [and] out of touch with reality,” he added.
As part of a long thread, Bates responded to the president calling Medupi a fitting symbol of SA state-owned enterprises.
“Medupi is, in another argument, a ‘fitting symbol’ of poor governance and mega-projects.
“Construction began 12 years ago, the plant is still incomplete and earlier this year, [Eskom’s] Jabu Mabuza said the final cost is anticipated to be R18 billion”.
Later in the thread, she asks: “Was the desk of the president well-lit while he was writing? Meanwhile [load shedding] is ongoing and doesn’t get so much as a mention.”
According to Haffajee: “Medupi is a ‘fitting symbol’ Fo sho. Late. Expensive. Strike prone. Effed up.”
“We want to know what is wrong with [Eskom] now and how it will be fixed Mr President,” tweeted Achmat.
“You don’t need to worry about the delivery of most expensive useless and corrupt present. Father Christmas will place under a tree. He will bring Medupi one day.”
Silke, meanwhile, reacted to Ramaphosa saying in the letter that he was struck by Medupi’s “massive size”.
“What would strike one about [Medupi] is precisely how massive it is – a massively over-budget, non-performing installation massively damaging the [SA economy] – that’s how massive it is,” he tweeted.
Several Twitter users also reacted to Ramaphosa saying it was his first visit to Medupi, questioning why he hadn’t visited before as deputy president, president, or as the person appointed by former president Jacob Zuma to oversee the turnaround of three state-owned enterprises, including Eskom, in 2014.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trócaire appeals to Louth for support for families living in war zones this Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week the Irish overseas development agency Trócaire launched its Christmas Appeal with an urgent call from Trócaire CEO Caoimhe de Barra for people in county Louth to support innocent families who are caught up in wars and conflicts around the world.
“Where Trócaire works, millions people have known nothing but war and have lived through constant conflict since they were born” according to Caoimhe.
“Trócaire is working to protect them and keep them safe. We are asking the public to support us and make sure these innocent people aren’t forgotten this Christmas.”
This Christmas marks the 50th anniversary of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s iconic War is Over ‘peace’ campaign. Trócaire has reimagined the campaign with a 2019 ‘War Is Over Christmas appeal’ supporting families who are living in war zones around the world.
According to Caoimhe from Trócaire, families fleeing conflict urgently need food, shelter and healthcare this Christmas in many of the countries where Trócaire works.
“Millions of children around the world have known nothing but conflict in their lives. Their lives are on hold because they are living in war zones. It seems that in many cases the world has forgotten these children. This Christmas we want them to know that we haven’t forgotten them,” she said.
“The figures are frightening” said Caoimhe. “In Syria, Somalia and Gaza alone, where Trócaire works, an estimated 19 million people have known nothing but war – children have lived in conflict zones since they were born.”
After 8 years of war 6.7m people (approximately half of the entire Syrian population) have been forced to leave their country. In Somalia there has been an ongoing conflict since 1991 and currently half of the population (6.2 million people) is experiencing severe food shortages with millions requiring life-saving assistance.
Meanwhile the Israeli- Palestinian conflict has resulted in close to 2 million people in Gaza (80% of the population) relying on humanitarian assistance to survive.
“Donating to Trócaire’s Christmas appeal will help people born into some of the longest-running conflicts in the world” said Caoimhe.
“We are grateful and thankful for the support we receive from the people of Louth each year. Their support directly impacts families and communities around the world and that is why it is so vital this Christmas.”
According to Trócaire, the agency will deliver food, shelter, medicine and protection to innocent people living in warzones around the world thanks to the donations it receives this Christmas. More information is available from www.trocaire.org or by calling 1850 408 408.

Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has announced that Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has been placed under administration.
At a press briefing, Mbalula also came to a decision to dissolve the interim Prasa board, a decision based on issues within Prasa.
This was informed by experience as the challenges were deep-rooted, he said, and replacing an interim board with a permanent one would not solve the problem.
Bongisizwe Mpondo has been appointed Prasa administrator with immediate effect while Mbalula is determined to stabilise the state-owned enterprise.
Among the administrator’s key priorities will be addressing all matters raised in the auditor-general’s report to ensure that there are no repeat findings.
Mpondo is an entrepreneur who has experience in corporate governance as well as working with public institutions to improve operational efficiencies. He has served on the boards of many public entities.
The SOE has been in the spotlight since President Cyril Ramaphosa, alongside Mbalula, was trapped during commute in Pretoria for almost four hours.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deadline looms for comments on plan to expand paid street parking in Cape Town | Cape Argus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Cape Town residents have been reminded to comment on a proposal to expand the areas subjected to paid street parking. 
In a statement on Sunday, Felicity Purchase, mayco member for transport, told residents that the deadline to submit their comments and suggestions on the proposal to expand managed parking to more areas across Cape Town is Friday.
Sub-councils, business owners, and residents from CBDs and popular recreational areas like Camps Bay and Muizenberg have requested the City to expand managed parking to these areas due to the rapid increase in demand for on-street parking.
Purchase said: “Managed parking means the City charges a tariff for the use of an on-street parking bay; that the tariff is determined by the time the bay is being occupied and that those who park in CBDs are charged per 15 minutes.
“Visitors to recreational areas will be charged per three hours; that time restrictions are applicable; and the management times are from 8am to 5pm on weekdays and 8am to 1pm on Saturdays,” said Purchase.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonko no-show in Voi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At the Voi Law Court where Governor Mike Sonko was expected to take plea on Monday, there was nothing unusual.
Sessions at the Taita Taveta court went on while he appeared at the Milimani Law Court in Nairobi even as police sources indicated that the governor was expected in Voi to answer to assault charges.
Sources at the court also said they were expecting Sonko to appear and face charges of resisting arrest and assaulting Coast regional police commander Rashid Yakub.
There was also little activity at the Ikanga Airstrip in Voi, which was last Friday the scene of high drama when the county boss resisted arrest and refused to board a police helicopter meant to airlift him to Nairobi.
He was later subdued and airlifted to the capital, coming just hours after Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji called for his arrest that morning.
Sonko has since gone on to express unease with the manner in which he was arrested and locked up last week.
“In the last three months, I have been summoned by the EACC four times; I have faithfully honoured all the summons,” he said in a post on his official social media page.
“Question is, what was so difficult for Mr Noordin Haji or Mr Twalib Mbarak to follow the same process of summoning me to present myself at the EACC offices for processing and charging?” he wondered.
The police, however, maintain that Sonko was attempting escape when he was intercepted at the Ndara roadblock.

Six of the victims were still at the Kenyatta National Hospital undergoing treatment
Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo confirmed that another person was on Saturday, December 7, pulled out of the rubble alive.
According to a report by The Standard, a mother, Venny Gechemba, suspected that two of her children, Frank Kerosi and Ezra, both under 10 years, were among the people that had been buried while at cyber Café located at the basement of the building.
“I cannot eat. I cannot sleep. I just want my babies,” she narrated to the paper.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flying along Kenyan coastline now risky</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The weatherman has issued a warning over flying along the coastline as heavy rains continue to pound several parts of the country.
For the next three days, Mombasa and other coastal counties will experience heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms.
Mr Edward Ngure, Mombasa's Director of Meteorology, told the Nation of cyclonic activities reducing pressure in the India Ocean, with most clouds moving towards the cyclone.
"Heavy rains will be accompanied by strong winds offshore, which may which may result in a storm surge in the ocean," said Mr Ngure.
AREAS AFFECTED
According to a weather update issued on Monday, the region will receive rains in the morning throughout the week, with sunny intervals and thunderstorms.
In Mombasa, areas expected to be affected are Nyali, Kisauni, Shanzu, Likoni, Mvita, Changamwe and Jomvu.
"[The rains are] going to affect areas in the entire coastline from Lamu to Kwame. The situation gets worse as you move south towards Madagascar," Mr Ngure said.
The weatherman also warned of flash floods in low lying areas and those with poor drainage systems, as well as in areas with unfilled quarries. He issued alerts to residents of Galana and Tana River.
Fishermen and beach goers were also warned about strong winds.
HOMELESS
By Monday morning, most parts of Mombasa were experiencing continuous rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms.
In Taita Taveta, the county government said it will support victims of rain-related calamities by relocating them to safer ground and reconstructing their houses.
More than 200 families have been left homeless by heavy rains that destroyed their houses.
Some of the families are camping at Voi Primary School as the government and well-wishers look into resettling them.
Governor Granton Samboja said the county will pay for the relocation but asked for help from the national government.
"As we continue to assess, my government will support affected families by relocating and reconstructing their homes," he said in Rong'e, without revealing whether funds had been set aside.
DAMAGE
Voi and Wundanyi sub-counties are most affected, with three deaths reported so far.
In Wundanyi, 41 houses have been destroyed by mudslides and roads rendered impassable. 
Well-wishers have provided the families with shelter amid calls by the government for the people to move to safer areas.
Leaders led by Mr Samboja and Wundanyi MP Danson Mwashako urged the national government to disburse funds to mitigate the damages.
"We need help fixing our roads because some of them are totally impassable," the governor said.
Public service operators are up in arms over the poor state of the roads while farmers say they cannot transport their produce to markets.
IMPOSTERS
Meanwhile, more than 120 people were expelled from the Voi camp after it was established that they were not flood victims.
Jaram Oranga, the county's coordinator of the Kenya Red Cross Society, said some people were taking advantage of the situation to get free food and shelter.
"We conducted investigations and realised they were not genuine flood victims," he said.
Mr Oranga said only 185 people were camping at the school.
"We don't know when we will close the camp. It is the responsibility of the county government to resettle them," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wa Iria party wants Helb loans waived</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Civic Renewal Party (CRP), which is affiliated to Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, has called on the Ministry of Education to consider writing off all loans owed to the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) by graduates who are not employed.
According to the party, which has written to the ministry over the matter, the prevailing difficult situation in the country among the youth should inform the ministry to cancel all the debts, just like the national government has waived debt for coffee and other sectors.
CRP official James Mwangi said Helb should also stop charging interest on the student loans going forward.
YOUTH HOPELESS
“We appeal to CS George Magoha to cancel all student loan debt for hundreds of thousands of unemployed graduates who owe billions of shillings (to Helb) and place a cap on student loan interest rates going forward at zero rates. This is because of the prevailing environment in the country which has made most of the youth hopeless and increased cases of suicides in the country,” Mr Mwangi said.
He said the party has written to education officials seeking for the waiver and recommending for huge investments in the higher education sector just the way other government departments are heavily funded.
CHRISTMAS GIFT
“We encourage high investment in the education sector especially on higher education.
“This will be the biggest Christmas gift President Uhuru Kenyatta can give unemployed graduates in Kenya who have lost hope due to hard economic times,” Mr Mwangi told the Nation.
The party has cautioned Helb not to publish information on loan defaulters as the board threatened last month, saying doing so will contravene the privacy of the debtors as enshrined in the Constitution and the recently enacted Data Protection Act, 2019.
“We shall not allow Helb to flout the constitutional regulations on giving out private information to the public. Instead, state agencies should advocate for free tuition and debt-free public colleges and universities,” Mr Mwangi noted.
HELB NOTICE
Last month, Helb issued a 30-day notice saying on its expiry it would publish the names of defaulters.
“Please take note that names and photos of loan beneficiaries who have defaulted repayment of the loans from 1975 will be published in the leading newspapers after expiry of 30 days from the date of this notice,” read the Helb notice.
After the 30 days, it added that it will proceed to take legal actions against the defaulters.
According to Helb, more than 80,000 Kenyans have failed to remit a total of a Sh50 billion in loan repayments.
Defaulters are slapped with a Sh5,000 monthly penalty according to Helb policy.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karnataka bypoll results: 'I will give a good administration in the next three-and-half years with the help of our ministers and MLAs,' an upbeat Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru
Celebrating BJP's good performance in the bypolls in Karnataka, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa today said he would ensure a stable and pro-development government for the next three-and-half years - the remainder of his term.
"Voters have given their verdict and the results are out. Now we have to focus on the development of the state. I will give a good administration in the next three-and-half years with the help of our ministers and MLAs," an upbeat Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru.
He sought the support of the opposition to complete his term unhindered.
"The opposition has been trying to create confusion among people. I appeal to them that at least from now on give us their complete support," Yediyurappa said.
"We had given assurance to all the disqualified (Congress-JDS) MLAs that they will be made ministers. So there is no question of backtracking from what we promised them. We will make them ministers and give them responsibility to grow our party base in their area," he said.
The BJP fielded 13 disqualified MLAs in the by-election held on December 5 in 15 constituencies. The party is leading in 12 seats, the Congress in two seats and an independent in one seat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Include Shia Muslims in Citizenship Amendment Bill, Shia Central Waqf Board urges Centre</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Shia Central Waqf Board on Monday urged the Centre to include Shia Muslims in the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, The Hindu reported.
The board said that Shias were subjected to “inhuman acts” in Sunni Muslims-dominated countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. “They are being killed for being Shia,” the board’s chairman Waseem Rizvi said.
Since Shias were a “rare section” of Muslims, they must be protected from “persecution and excesses”, he said. “Shia community has been persecuted continuously for nearly 1,400 years by Muslim majoritarian Sunni society and continue to be.” He also praised the bill and said that it was an example of India’s humanity.
The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, proposes an amendment to a 1955 law to provide citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians from the Muslim-majority nations of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. If passed, it will grant citizenship to persecuted people from these communities, provided they have resided in India for six years. The cut-off date is December 31, 2014.
“We are a minority within the minorities in India… If you are taking Buddhists, Jains, Christians under the ambit of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, then you must include Shias as well,” said All India Shia Personal Law Board spokesperson Maulana Yasoob Abbas on Sunday, according to The Indian Express.
The board passed a resolution on Sunday urging the Centre to include Shia Muslims in the bill. “The AISPLB demands that Shia Muslims should be given Indian citizenship because the Indian Constitution views all religions with an equal view,” the resolution said.
On Monday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the controversial bill in the Lok Sabha amid protests from Opposition parties. While the Opposition parties alleged that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminated against Muslims, Amit Shah defended the bill and claimed that it was not at all discriminatory.
He claimed that Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians were ill-treated in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, which state in their Constitution that Islam is their law of land. “So this bill will give these persecuted people citizenship,” Shah said. “If from these three countries, any Muslim petitions for citizenship, we will consider with an open mind but they will not get the benefit of this bill as the [Muslims] wouldn’t have been persecuted.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rajan pointed out that extreme centralisation, coupled with lack of empowered ministers and a coherent guiding vision meant reforms picked up steam only when PMO focused on them and lost pace when its attention switched to other pressing issues
Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said the centralised nature of current Modi government doesn't work well in carrying out of economic reforms. In his article 'How to fix the economy' for India Today magazine, the noted economist pointed that this form of governance might work well for the political and social agenda of the party, but does not do well with economic reforms.
"Not just decision-making but also ideas and plans emanate from a small set of personalities around the Prime Minister and in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). That works well for the party's political and social agenda, which is well laid out, and where all these individuals have domain expertise. It works less well for economic reforms, where there is less of a coherent articulated agenda at the top and less domain knowledge of how the economy works at the national rather than state level," Rajan wrote.

Rajan said that Modi government's promise of 'minimum government, maximum governance' is often misunderstood. "What was meant was that government would do things more efficiently, not that people and the private sector would be freed to do more. While the government continues the creditable drive to automation-direct benefits transfer to recipients is an important achievement-the role of the government in many spheres has expanded, not shrunk," he added.
Rajan pointed out that extreme centralisation, coupled with lack of empowered ministers and a coherent guiding vision meant reforms picked up steam only when PMO focused on them and lost pace when its attention switched to other pressing issues.

"Often, these efforts take the form of grand gestures because the problems are large and require significant response-so we get demonetisation, bank mergers, corporate tax cuts... However, such episodic moves are not necessarily well-timed or synchronised towards a larger vision, so any associated economic benefits are diluted. Moreover, the follow-up to deal with the unintended consequences is inadequate since the line ministries are disempowered," he added.
Among remedies for the economic slowdown, Rajan suggested that decentralisation is critical for economic growth. He said that while the Centre has to give direction and political impetus to reforms, it cannot hold on to every rein.
"It has to start by empowering its own ministers, and also engage the states since many of the actions need state support," Rajan said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Human skull and skeleton dredged up from the depths of the Thames 'belonged to convict thrown overboard from 18th century prison ship'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A human skull and partial skeleton dredged up from the murky depths of the River Thames is thought to be a convict thrown overboard from an 18th century prison ship.
The remains are now to be studied by leading forensics experts in Australia in the hope of finding out why the person came to be buried in a shallow grave next to mudflats in the Thames Estuary.
They have been dated between 200 and 300 years old and were discovered in an area where prison hulks would moor before setting off for Australian penal colonies.
Mudlarking expert Lara Maiklem stumbled across the gruesome find in summer after seeing the top of a skull poking through stones.
Ms Maiklem, known as the London Mudlark for her hobby of scavenging the water's edge for interesting finds, then discovered leg and arm bones nearby.
She is convinced the bones belonged to a convict who became ill on a prison ship and whose body was hastily disposed of in the riverside mud.
She says similar finds are now becoming more common as the London water level rises and begins to wash away old burial places.
Ms Maiklem, 48, who documents her finds on her London Mudlark social media accounts, gathered up the bones and marked the spot using GPS before informing the police, the Museum of London and the local finds liaison officer.
The bones were taken to a police forensics lab in Scotland where they were dated.
It is thought the body may be one of hundreds of people buried alongside the Thames foreshore after they became ill on prison ships.
Many were simply slung over the side and hastily buried so as not to make others onboard sick. 
Now, a university expert in Australia wants to study the remnants to see if she can shed further light on who they might belong to.
Dr Paola Magni is a senior lecturer in forensic science at Murdoch University in Perth and specialises in the study of barnacles on bones.
She said the university was 'very excited' to receive the bones.
Dr Magni said: 'Back in June I travelled to the UK to present my research about barnacles and suddenly Lara's discovery - a skull covered by barnacles - popped up on my social media.
'I thought 'this is a sign!' It is a very interesting case for me. 
'I contacted Lara via social media to explain my work and the prospective research that could be done on the skull.
'It looks like this possibility is becoming a reality.'
The research will be headed by the Western Australia Museum and will also include museum director and barnacle expert Diana Jones, forensic pathologist and facial reconstructor Edda Guareschi and oceanographer Dr Jennifer Verduin.
Dr Verduin has been brought in to try and find out how the skull came to its geographical location as barnacles are usually seawater creatures.
Dr Magni added: 'A multidisciplinary investigation like this is extremely rare and is a great opportunity for forensic science education.
'Overall we would like to give a face to this person and reconstruct his story, from the cause of death, the place of death and the movements of the remains during the years. The evidence left by nature will give us the evidence to solve this mystery.'
A forensic artist is also to try and recreate the dead man's face to allow historians a look back in time at who he or she may have been.
Ms Maiklem, who lives on the Kent coast and has published several books on her hobby, said she was pleased so much research was being done to try and find out more about her Thames skull.
'This person deserved more than they got,' she said.
'They could have been on a prison hulk for something as minor as stealing a loaf of bread to feed their family, the things they transported them for were so minor.
'I think this person deserves more than being put into an industrial incinerator.'
Ms Maiklem was in the Thames Estuary when the tide was out and was walking back over mud flaps with a friend when the skull caught their eye.
She said: 'It was down in a little hollow.
'The river often doesn't move things very far. The law is that we have to tell police when we suspect we have discovered human remains.
The islands in Kent, owned by Natural England, were used as a mass burial ground for criminals who died on prison ships in the 1800s.
Coastal erosion began to expose the remains in 2017, with dozens of coffins and bodies uncovered by waters.
Experts say more than 1,000 men and boys were incarcerated in floating fortresses 'Retribution' and 'Bellerophon' anchored at Sheerness, made of decommissioned Ships of the Line stripped of their masts and sails.  
Naval historian Professor Eric Grove said: 'Obviously when people died on board these prison hulks they had to be buried somewhere and island close-by was the obvious place.'
There has been debate about how bad the conditions were on board, but it is believed a cholera outbreak on Retribution on the 1830s may help explain the dozens of bodies now littering the island.  
Transportation of convict ships from Britain and Ireland to Australia officially ended in 1868.
Professor Groves added: 'There were a lot of men in close quarters, and if an epidemic began it spread quickly.'
'We gathered up what we could find together, dug a shallow pit and put a stake in the ground and took a GPS reading.
'Police went and gathered them during the next tide.'
She added: 'The skull was covered in barnacles and it was obvious to me that it was quite old, but the police had to come anyway. They told me they had an ongoing case in the area.
'It's highly likely that this skeleton has come from a prison ship moored in the area, often they were moored on the marshes around Woolwich and housed Napoleonic prisoners of war.
'These ships were just dreadful. As soon as there was any sign of disease onboard it would have spread like wildfire.
'When they died they just buried them on the nearest patch of land.
'River levels have risen by a foot so it's starting to erode these areas where they buried people.'
Prison hulks were decommissioned warships, stripped of their masts, rigging and sails and used to house those convicted of both serious and minor crimes.
They were moored up along the Thames and Medway estuaries, as well as at Portsmouth, Bermuda and Gibraltar where prisoners were put to work in the dockyards.
They often held criminals awaiting transportation to penal colonies in Australia.
In 1798 the hulks held more than 1,400 out of about 1,900 people waiting for transportation to Australia.
The Thames skull is currently at Kent Police Headquarters in Maidstone, Kent, and is soon to be signed over to Dr Magni.
Ms Maiklem added: 'We may finally get to look into the face of this man and if he was awaiting transportation he may finally make it to Australia after all.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Publish charges against ex-bank chiefs, Diezani, CSOs tell EFCC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Agency Reporter
 
A coalition of society organisations has urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to publish the criminal charges against a former Petroleum Minister Diezani Allison – Madueke and other persons indicted for money laundering.
Others indicted are former NNPC and commercial banks officials Ben Otti, Nnamdi Okonkwo, Stanley Lawson, Lanre Adesanya and Dauda Lawal.
The Northern Youths in Defence of Democracy and Justice (NYDDJ) disclosed this in a statement signed by its convener Abba Suleiman after an emergency meeting in Abuja on Sunday.
EFCC spokesperson Wilson Uwajuren recently denied in a statement that the commission had dropped the criminal charge against Diezani and others.
He said the EFCC took a prosecutorial decision to split the initial 14-count charge to enable separate arraignment of the defendants.
The CSOs, however, said if the charges are still in place, the anti-graft agency should be bold enough to publish the charge sheet.
The EFCC, according to the civil society groups, labored to justify why it withdrew charges against all the accused persons and retained only Mr. Lawal, as the sole accused person. “The EFCC is trying to counteract a court process with a verbal press statement,” they said.
The statement said withdrawing charges against Diezani and others while retaining that of Mr Lawal is counter-productive to the anti-graft war of President Muhammadu Buhari.
“Witch-hunting, selective prosecution, cherry-picking accused persons and preferential treatment of suspects, will only further confirm the widely held view that EFCC has derailed from its initial mandate,” the civil societies said.
The statement reads: “We stand with the reports that the charges against Diezani and Otti have been withdrawn, as is clearly shown on the face of the charge sheet which bears only Lawal’s name.
“We challenge EFCC to publish the charges and controvert what we have said here. If EFCC claims that the charges against Diezani, Lawson, Adesanya, and Otti are still in place, we ask them to show us the charge sheet.
“Our advice to EFCC is that they should retrace their steps and revert to the spirit of the EFFC (Establishment) Act, where the organisation was envisaged to be one that will be run devoid of sentiments and personal considerations in fighting financial crime.“
The CSOs advice the commission to preserve its credibility locally and internationally, adding that “the fight against corruption will be greatly compromised if it proceeds with the withdrawal of corruption charges against suspected perpetrators of one the monumental corruption cases in Nigeria’s history.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Jólasveinar descend from the mountains to wreak havoc in towns and villages, starting with Stekkjastaur on December 12 who is apparently as stiff as wood and preys on farmers’ sheep.
Twelve others follow, such as Bjúgnakrækir the sausage swiper and Gluggagægir the window peeper.
Don’t worry kids, they don’t bother people living in Scotland – which is probably just as well, because the troll problems here seem to be a lot more serious.
This week for example, trolls nearly put the kibosh on a Perthshire town’s winter display.
Volunteers in Rattray said there would be no Christmas tree this year, partly because of logistical problems transporting the giant fir, but also because they were fed-up with “disheartening” comments on social media.
Critics complained about the state of last year’s tree, and even said it looked like it had been decorated by drunks from the local pub.
Thankfully, a surge in support online has prompted a change of heart and steps are being taken to arrange for a new tree beside the parish church (in the meantime, a smaller one has been put in place by kind locals).
This has been a sad example of how online trolls – or rather normal folk thundering out their opinions on Facebook – can have real life consequences.
Who can blame the volunteers for threatening to pull the plug on the display, if all they get for their hard work, including months of fundraising and paperwork, is disparaging comments.
The truth is last year’s tree was perfectly fine, and certainly better than none at all.
The volunteers who make sure our towns and villages don’t go without Christmas sparkle deserve our praise, not snarky criticism.
Remember, these groups give up their own time to brightening up communities during the darkest weeks of the year. We need to stick up for them and support them when we can.
As a once-great man once said: “It’s so easy to laugh, it’s so easy to hate, it takes guts to be gentle and kind.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Kusi Ideas Festival is being hosted in the outskirts of Kigali at the Intare Conference Arena, one of the country’s modern conference facilities.
The facility was built to spur Rwanda's meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE) segment and is located in Rusororo, a growing suburb on a hill envisages the pace of the country's rapid economic growth.
Not so long ago, the suburb was mostly a semi-urban area but is now brewing with construction activity, as Rwanda moves to expand growth beyond the capital.
The arena was inaugurated in June 2017 and is wholly owned by the country's ruling party - RPF - said to be built solely from party members' contributions.
The Intare Conference Arena is capable of hosting meetings and events of various sizes in equal comfort, and has held several in the past, with its main competitor now being the Kigali Convention Centre.
The conference arena is built with a futuristic design including a curved dome steel that enhances retention of sound inside.
The main auditorium boasts a capacity of up to 2,500 people seated and 3,600 standing, with enhanced PA systems and high speed 4G wireless internet.
