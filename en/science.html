    <h5 class="mb-1">1.9 billion people at risk from mountain water shortages, study shows</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A quarter of the world’s population are at risk of water supply problems as mountain glaciers, snow-packs and alpine lakes are run down by global heating and rising demand, according to an international study.
The first inventory of high-altitude sources finds the Indus is the most important and vulnerable “water tower” due to run-off from the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, Ladakh, and Himalayan mountain ranges, which flow downstream to a densely populated and intensively irrigated basin in Pakistan, India, China and Afghanistan.
The authors warn this vast water tower – a term they use to describe the role of water storage and supply that mountain ranges play to sustain environmental and human water demands downstream – is unlikely to sustain growing pressure by the middle of the century when temperatures are projected to rise by 1.9C (3.42F), rainfall to increase by less than 2%, but the population to grow by 50% and generate eight times more GDP.
Strains are apparent elsewhere in the water tower index, which quantifies the volume of water in 78 mountain ranges based on precipitation, snow cover, glacier ice storage, lakes and rivers. This was then compared with the drawdown by communities, industries and farms in the lower reaches of the main river basins.
The study by 32 scientists, which was published in the Nature journal on Monday, confirms Asian river basins face the greatest demands but shows pressures are also rising on other continents.
“It’s not just happening far away in the Himalayas but in Europe and the United States, places not usually thought to be reliant on mountains for people or the economy,” said one of the authors, Bethan Davies, of Royal Holloway University.
“We always knew the Indus was important, but it was surprising how the Rhône and Rhine have risen in importance, along with the Fraser and Columbia.”
The study says 1.9 billion people and half of the world’s biodiversity hotspots could be negatively affected by the decline of natural water towers, which store water in winter and release it slowly over the summer.
This buffering capacity is weakening as glaciers lose mass and snow-melt dynamics are disrupted by temperatures that are rising faster at high altitude than the global average.
“Climate change threatens the entire mountain ecosystem,” the report concludes. “Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world’s most important and vulnerable water towers.”
As well as local conservation efforts, the authors say international action to reduce carbon emissions is the best way to safeguard water towers.
Citing recent research by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Davies said 75% of high-altitude snow and ice would be retained if global warming could be kept within 1.5C. However, 80% would be lost by 2100 if the world continued on a path of business as usual.
• This article was amended on 10 December 2019 because an earlier version converted the absolute temperature of 1.9C (to 35.4F), rather than converting a rise of 1.9C, which is 3.42F.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Some of the world's most vital fresh water reserves are DRYING UP as scientists predict climate change and population growth will to lead to a 30 per cent increase in demand over the next 30 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billions of people are at risk as the world's water reserves dry up, warns a new study.
More than 30 of the world's leading scientists say mountain regions, which supply a quarter of the world's population - around 1.9 billion people - with freshwater, are drying up.
Climate change and population growth are to blame, with demand expected to rise by 30 per cent over the next 30 years, according to the United Nations.
Dr Tobias Bolch, of the University of St Andrews who contributed to the research, said: 'The study quantified for the first time both the natural water supply from the mountains as well as the water demand by society, and also provided projections for the future based on climatic and socioeconomic scenarios.
'The projected loss of ice and snow and increasing water needs makes specific densely-populated basins located in arid regions, like the Indus basin in South Asia or the Amu Darya basin in Central Asia, highly vulnerable in the future.'
Scientists analysed 80 water-systems, known as mountain water towers, which store and transport water via glaciers, lakes and snow packs.
They ranked water towers based on how important they are to nearby communities and how vulnerable they are now and in the future.
Prof Walter Immerzeel said: 'What is unique about our study is that we have assessed the water towers' importance, not only by looking at how much water they store and provide, but also how much mountain water is needed downstream and how vulnerable these systems and communities are to a number of likely changes in the next few decades.'
The team found the Indus basin, the world's largest water tower, supplying over a billion people across four countries - Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan, is the most vulnerable.
Other exposed towers include the Andes, the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.
Researcher Dr Arthur Lutz, of Utrecht University, said: 'By assessing all glacial water towers on Earth, we identified the key basin that should be on top of regional and global political agendas.
The team hopes their findings will give decision makers the evidence they need to act.
Dr Jonathan Baillie, Chief Scientist at the National Geographic Society, added: 'Mountains are iconic and sacred places around the world, but the critical role they play in sustaining life on Earth is not well understood.
'This research will help decision-makers, on global and local levels, prioritise where action should be taken to protect mountain systems, the resources they provide, and the people who depend on them.'
The findings were published in the journal Nature.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European Space Agency to launch space debris collector in 2025</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A four-armed robotic junk collector will be launched into space by the European Space Agency in what it says will be the first mission to remove an item of debris from orbit.
The ClearSpace-1 mission, scheduled for launch in 2025, will cost €120m and will grab a single piece of junk. But the agency hopes the mission will pave the way for a wide-reaching clear-up operation, with Esa’s director general calling for new rules that would compel those who launch satellites to take responsibility for removing them from orbit once they are retired from use.
“Imagine how dangerous sailing the high seas would be if all the ships ever lost in history were still drifting on top of the water,” said Jan Wörner, Esa’s director general. “That is the current situation in orbit, and it cannot be allowed to continue.”
In the past 60 years, thousands of tonnes of junk has accumulated around the Earth, including old rocket parts, about 3,500 defunct satellites and an estimated 750,000 smaller fragments, some from collisions between larger bits of junk. The fragments are typically circulating with a velocity of 20,000km/h (12,500mph).
Unless a clear-up operation is mounted, the chances of collisions will escalate as thousands more satellites are put into orbit.
Funding for the mission was agreed at Space19+, ESA’s misterial council, which took place in Seville, Spain, at the end of November. The mission will be run by a consortium led by a Swiss startup called Clearspace.
The target for ClearSpace-1 is a piece of junk called Vespa, which was left in an orbit around 800km above the Earth by ESA’s Vega launcher in 2013. Vespa weighs 100kg – around the size of a small satellite – and was selected because it has a simple shape and sturdy construction, which make it unlikely to fragment when it is grabbed.
The “chaser” ClearSpace space probe will be launched into the target orbit where it will track down Vespa, grab it using a quartet of robotic arms and drag it out of orbit, with Vespa and the chaser both burning up in the atmosphere on the way down to Earth.
A future ambition is to create a clear-up robot that could eject junk into the atmosphere, before continuing to capture and de-orbit other pieces of junk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA unveils stunning photo of Geminids Meteor Shower ahead of peak this weekend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While a meteor shower is stunning to behold, a new photo of the Geminids Meteor Shower is even more exceptional, thanks to a special appearance from Jupiter .
Photographer Yuri Beletsky snapped the photo in Chile back in 2013, but NASA has now featured it as its Astronomy Picture of the Day.
In the photo, the meteors all appear to be streaming out from the same point in the sky.
NASA explained: “When the Earth crosses a stream of Sun-orbiting meteors, these meteors appear to come from the direction of the stream - with the directional point called the radiant. 
“An example occurs every mid-December for the Geminids meteor shower, as apparent in the featured image.
“Recorded near the shower's peak in 2013, the featured skyscape captures Gemini's shooting stars in a four-hour composite from the dark skies of the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.”
The foreground of the photo features the du Pont Telescope, as well as the SWOPE telescope, as well as a beautiful setting sun.
Meanwhile, the skies also feature Jupiter seen as the bright spot near centre of the image, the central band of the Milky Way, seen vertically on the left of the image, and the Orion Nebula on the far left.
NASA added: “Dust swept up from the orbit of active asteroid 3200 Phaethon, Gemini's meteors enter the atmosphere traveling at about 22 kilometers per second.”
This year’s Geminids meteor shower will peak this weekend, providing you with the perfect opportunity to see a shooting star yourself!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five people have been confirmed dead, 18 have been rescued and are injured, some seriously, and several remain unaccounted for after a sudden volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island off the east coast of New Zealand.
The island is a tourist destination and around 50 people were on it when it erupted on Monday afternoon. Volcanologists at GeoNet, which operates a geological hazard monitoring system, described the eruption as impulsive and short-lived, with an ash plume that rose to more than three kilometres above the vent.
Volcanic hazards
White Island is one of several volcanoes in New Zealand that can produce sudden explosive eruptions at any time. In this case, magma is shallow, and the heat and gases affect surface and ground water to form vigorous hydrothermal systems.
In these, water is trapped in pores of rocks in a super-heated state. Any external process, such as an earthquake, gas input from below, or even a change in the lake water level can tip this delicate balance and release the pressure on the hot and trapped water.
The resulting steam-driven eruption, also called a hydrothermal or phreatic eruption, can happen suddenly and with little to no warning. The expansion of water into steam is supersonic in speed and the liquid can expand to 1,700 times its original volume. This produces catastrophic impacts.
The expansion energy is enough to shatter solid rock, excavate craters and eject rock fragments and ash out to hundreds of metres away from the vent. We know of sites in New Zealand where material has been blasted out over three kilometres from the vent by such eruptions.
Potential for further eruptions
The hazards expected from steam-driven eruptions are violent ejections of hot blocks and ash, and the formation of “hurricane-like” currents of wet ash and coarse particles that radiate from the explosion vent. These can be deadly in terms of impact trauma, burns and respiratory injuries.
The eruptions are short-lived, but once one happens, there is a high chance for further, generally smaller ones as the system re-equilibrates. White Island is an acute location for such activity, but it is not the only location in New Zealand where this can happen.
No warning
Monitoring and warning for hydrothermal eruptions is a huge challenge. We don’t normally see these eruptions coming, no matter how much we would like to. Many systems are already “primed” for such events, but the triggers are poorly understood.
The warning periods, once an event gets underway, are likely in the order of seconds to minutes. Our only hope for anticipating these events is to track potential vapour and liquid pressure in hydrothermal systems and to learn from their long-term behaviour when they are at a super-critical state. Unfortunately there are no simple rules that can be followed and each hydrothermal system is different.
In this age of technology and instrumental monitoring, it seems irrational that there should be little or no warning for such eruptions. The eruption is not caused by magma, but by steam, and this is much harder to track in our current monitoring systems.
We have seen several other fatal hydrothermal catastrophies unfold in other parts of the world, such as the 2014 eruption of Mount Ontake in Japan. New Zealand has been luckier than many other parts of the world, until now.

Mount Ruapehu (crater lake), Mount Tongariro (Te Maari and Ketetahi) and geothermal areas of the central North Island all have the potential to cause such events. We know there have been more than 60 hydrothermal eruptions in the last 100 years in New Zealand. Some of these have caused loss of life.

    <h5 class="mb-1">White Island eruption – Expert Reaction</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tourists were present on Whakaari/White Island when its volcano erupted at 2.11pm today.
A report from GeoNet duty volcanologist Geoff Kilgour states the short-lived eruption generated an ash plume to ~12,000ft above the vent. The Volcanic Alert Level has decreased to Level 3 (out of a possible 5).
Safety advice is available via the National Emergency Management Agency (Civil Defence).
The SMC asked experts to comment on the eruption.

Professor Shane Cronin, Volcanologist, University of Auckland, comments:
"Sudden, unheralded eruptions from volcanoes such as White Island can be expected at any time. Magma is close to the surface, and the heat and gases from this heat the surface and ground waters to form vigorous hydrothermal systems. We know hydrothermal and so-called 'phreatic' eruptions can occur suddenly and with little or no warning because they are driven by the expansion of super-heated water into steam.
"The hazards expected from such events are the violent ejection of hot blocks and ash, and formation of 'hurricane-like' currents of wet ash and coarse particles that radiate from the explosion vent. These can be deadly in terms of causing impact trauma, burns and respiratory problems. The eruptions are short-lived, but once one occurs, there are high chances for further, generally smaller ones as the system re-equilibrates."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Our Oceans Are Losing Oxygen At A Shocking Rate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world’s oceans are becoming parched of oxygen at an unprecedented rate.
A new IUCN report, released this weekend at the UN's Conference of the Parties (COP25) climate change conference in Madrid, has detailed the state of our suffocating seas. 
It estimates the world’s oceans lost around 2 percent of their oxygen between 1960 and 2010. Furthermore, the report estimates that there a now around 700 "dead zones," portions of the coast where oxygen is effectively absent, compared to just 45 dead zones pre-1960.
This is, quite obviously, terrible news for the planet’s fish. Species such as tuna, marlin, and sharks are especially sensitive to lower oxygen levels because of their large size and high energy demand. On the other hand, species of jellyfish and some squid are expected to thrive as they are more tolerant of low-oxygen conditions. 
Any changes to the ocean's oxygen concentration run the risk of collapsing food chains and causing widespread disruption throughout the marine ecosystem. Since many human populations depend on large fish for protein and their livelihood, the collapse could also have a harsh effect on millions of people.
The problem is only set to deepen too. The trend of ocean deoxygenation is primarily driven by climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, although nutrient pollution is also a factor. The deoxygenation occurs because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water. As the water holds less oxygen, it becomes more buoyant, resulting in reduced mixing of the oxygen-rich water layers near the surface with the ocean depths. So, under a “business-as-usual” scenario, whereby the climate crisis remains unaddressed and global temperatures continue to rise, oxygen levels in the ocean could drop by up to 4 percent by 2100. 
“We are now seeing increasingly low levels of dissolved oxygen across large areas of the open ocean. This is perhaps the ultimate wake-up call from the uncontrolled experiment humanity is unleashing on the world’s ocean as carbon emissions continue to increase," Dan Laffoley, Senior Advisor Marine Science and Conservation in IUCN's Global Marine and Polar Programme and a co-editor of the report, said in a statement. 
"Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification. To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas, we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources."
However, not all hope is lost just yet. The report authors argue that we can avoid catastrophe if we act sharply, primarily through the rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We've already done it once, new research has revealed, we can do it again. Just as the next 10 years, 2020 to 2030, are said to be the decisive decade for addressing the climate crisis, it’s also set to be a crucial period for the future of our oceans and all that depend on it. 
"Urgent global action to overcome and reverse the effects of ocean deoxygenation is needed. Decisions taken at the ongoing climate conference will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly, progressively and irrevocably lost,” said Minna Epps, IUCN Global Marine and Polar Programme Director.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oxygen in the oceans is being lost at an unprecedented rate, with "dead zones" proliferating and hundreds more areas showing oxygen dangerously depleted, as a result of the climate emergency and intensive farming, experts have warned. From a report: Sharks, tuna, marlin and other large fish species were at particular risk, scientists said, with many vital ecosystems in danger of collapse. Dead zones -- where oxygen is effectively absent -- have quadrupled in extent in the last half-century, and there are also at least 700 areas where oxygen is at dangerously low levels, up from 45 when research was undertaken in the 1960s. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature presented the findings on Saturday at the UN climate conference in Madrid, where governments are halfway through tense negotiations aimed at tackling the climate crisis.Grethel Aguilar, the acting director general of the IUCN, said the health of the oceans should be a key consideration for the talks. "As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray," she said. "The potentially dire effects on fisheries and vulnerable coastal communities mean that the decisions made at the conference are even more crucial." All fish need dissolved oxygen, but the biggest species are particularly vulnerable to depleted oxygen levels because they need much more to survive. Evidence shows that depleted levels are forcing them to move towards the surface and to shallow areas of sea, where they are more vulnerable to fishing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oceans Are Running Out of Oxygen Due to Climate Change</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world’s oceans—and their inhabitants—are being choked to death by climate change and nutrient pollution.
Ocean oxygen loss, according to a new report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is a growing menace to fisheries and species like tuna, marlin, and sharks.
Titled “Ocean deoxygenation: Everyone’s problem,” the peer-reviewed study highlights causes of, impacts to, and solutions for marine suffocation.
Ocean regions with low oxygen concentrations are expanding, IUCN warned, citing some 700 sites worldwide now affected by poor conditions—up from 45 in the 1960s.
Over the same six-decade period, the volume of anoxic waters—areas completely depleted of oxygen—in the global ocean has quadrupled.
“As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray,” IUCN Acting Director General Grethel Aguilar said in a statement.
The adverse process favors low-oxygen-tolerant species (microbes, jellyfish, some squid) at the expense of low-oxygen-sensitives ones (many marine species, most fish).
Particularly susceptible to low oxygen (because of their large size and high energy demands), tuna, marlin, and sharks are being driven into increasingly shallow surface layers of oxygen-rich water, making them vulnerable to overfishing.
“Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification,” study co-editor Dan Laffoley, senior advisor of marine science and conservation in IUCN’s Global Marine and Polar Program, explained.
“To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas,” he continued, “we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources.”
Very low ocean oxygen can also affect basic processes like the cycling of elements including nitrogen and phosphorous, which are crucial for life on Earth, the report warned.
Under a business-as-usual model, the ocean is expected to lose 3 to 4 percent of its global oxygen inventory by 2100.
But while a single-digit decrease may not seem dire, that average masks more severe local changes.
“Urgent global action to overcome and reverse the effects of ocean deoxygenation is needed,” IUCN Global Marine and Polar Program Director Minna Epps said.
“Decisions taken at the ongoing [2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid] will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly, progressively, and irrevocably lost,” Epps added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Our Oceans Are Significantly Losing Oxygen, Threatening Marine Life and Fisheries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marine life and many fish species are in grave danger as our oceans are losing oxygen due to climate change and nutrient pollution.
The IUCN carried out the biggest report of its kind on the matter, shedding worrying light on the subject.
It's no new topic, as nutrient pollution has been occurring for many years, however, climate change is making the lack of oxygen much worse as time goes by.
RELATED: EVEN CLIMATE MODELS 50 YEARS AGO ACCURATELY PREDICTED GLOBAL WARMING
The numbers are worrying. Approximately 700 ocean sites have low oxygen at the moment, a stark comparison to 'just' 45 in the 1960s.
This lowering of oxygen is threatening many marine species such as tuna, marlin, and sharks according to researchers.
The primary factor for this lack of oxygen is still nutrient run-off of chemicals from farms and industries, however, climate change is now playing a big part as well. 
Our oceans absorb much of the heat in our atmosphere, and as this has been increasing due to higher levels of carbon dioxide because of the greenhouse effect, our oceans are suffering.
Warmer waters can hold less oxygen. 
In turn, waters with warmer temperatures house more species such as jellyfish, but aren't as good for bigger fish species such as tuna. For these species, including marlin and sharks, this is very bad news.
"We have known about de-oxygenation but we haven't known the linkages to climate change and this is really worrying," said Minna Epps from IUCN.
"Not only has the decline of oxygen quadrupled in the past 50 years but even in the best-case emissions scenario, oxygen is still going to decline in the oceans."
Tropical regions in the world will suffer the most according to researchers.
If we carry on as we are currently, by 2100 our oceans will lose between three to four percent of their oxygen. This may not sound like a lot, but even small changes can have a massive impact on marine life.
Epps warned that "If we run out of oxygen it will mean habitat loss and biodiversity loss and a slippery slope down to slime and more jellyfish."
"It will also change the energy and the biochemical cycling in the oceans and we don't know what these biological and chemical shifts in the oceans can actually do."
Not a promising future for our oceans if changes don't happen right now.

It is often said that the oxygen in every second breath you take is produced by photo plankton, that are the true lungs of the planet. I discuss the extend of the oxygen decrease, which is more than you want to know.”
We know already that micro-plastics are detected in our oceans and even deposited in ice packs and alpine snow in many areas of the globe now.
So where could some of the “micro-plastics” come from?
Now a German scientific study has traced the micro-plastics to tyre ‘particulates’ from vehicles, so we are now part of the problem apparently.
Tyres are used in every corner of the globe now, and we have never considered tyre dust to be a threat and a potential pollutant to our environment, have we?
Tyres are made from oil ‘distillate’ products like styrene ,polyethene, nylon, butadiene and many others including formaldehyde, - so we should not be surprised at the sheer problems these “micro-plastics may be causing to our environment now and all living organisms.
So could we find ‘cleaner less toxic materials’ from which to make those tyres from?
We studied this problem and discovered that in 2001 three large international tyre companies came together to fund a study to produce a ‘prototype tyre’ that contained far less toxic chemicals than tyres are currently made from, which consisted of wood, grass and corn derivatives which may be a part solution to our reduction and less use toxic petroleum waste products and those companies are Bridgestone, Michelin, and Yulex Corporation specifically.

On the product application font, Bridgestone has recently launched Ecopia EP001S tyre with an A/A rating for wet grip as well as fuel economy in Europe and Japan.
144 Optimized top tread compound with maximum resistance toward aquaplaning and increased stiffness of the tread blocks has led to such improved tyre performance.
In 2012, Michelin had launched the MICHELIN ENERGY EV tyre for electric cars to increase their autonomy, which improves fuel economy and hence contributes toward sustainability.
145 Bridgestone has very recently developed tyre, which is made of 100% Guayule rubber. The company has also set an ambitious target of producing its entire tyre portfolio from sustainable materials.
146 Recently, Yulex Corporation has launched Yulex Pure, a guayule rubber that meets the requisite critical performance standards for many medical, industrial, and consumer applications and surpasses the performance standards of many synthetic lattices.
147 The company is using advanced genomic technologies for commercial production. These are a few instances, which reflect the urge and motivation of various companies toward sustainability.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app.45701Perhaps now NZ could become a world leader by finally producing the first ‘new commercially available ‘eco-friendly vehicle tyre composition’ since it has been science tested but yet to go into production here?
‘Eco-friendly vehicle tyre composition’ has been on the scientific horizon and has been known since 2001, - so why is it not in widespread use by now?
Perhaps ‘Big Oil’ felt it would damage their financial status after an oil free component vehicle tyre may be popular as they can be made of grass, trees, corn, and perhaps no petrochemicals may be needed to build the first “Eco-tyre?(QUOTE) “According to the Rubber Manufacturers Association, each tire produced takes 7 gallons of oil”
These two documents provide the evidence to show about “road dust from tyres is an overlooked pollutant of our waterways.Tyre dust is micro-plastics.https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/277na4_en.pdfhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es400871j• If the world is to limit the effects of global warming, drastic changes must be made and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/Executive Summary.
• All must be taken seriously now along with; “Comparison of Tire and Road Wear Particle Concentrations in Sediment for Watersheds in France, Japan, and the United States by Quantitative Pyrolysis GC/MS Analysis” report on sediments for watersheds.https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es400871jQUOTE: “Comparison of Tire and Road Wear Particle Concentrations in Sediment for Watersheds in France, Japan, and the United States by Quantitative Pyrolysis GC/MS Analysis
AbstractImpacts of surface runoff to aquatic species are an ongoing area of concern. Tire and road wear particles (TRWP) are a constituent of runoff, and determining accurate TRWP concentrations in sediment is necessary in order to evaluate the likelihood that these particles present a risk to the aquatic environment. TRWP consist of approximately equal mass fractions of tire tread rubber and road surface mineral encrustations. Sampling was completed in the Seine (France), Chesapeake (U.S.), and Yodo-Lake Biwa (Japan) watersheds to quantify TRWP in the surficial sediment of watersheds characterized by a wide diversity of population densities and land uses. By using a novel quantitative pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis for rubber polymer, we detected TRWP in 97% of the 149 sediment samples collected.
Plastic carpeting?
When we looked into the humble household carpet for any emissions of “micro- plastic particulates we were again shocked that 95% of the standard carpeting today is made from oil based derivatives again such as ‘Nylon 6’ and it’s many volatile organic chemical components. https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/sites/default/files/knowledge_-_toxics_in_carpets_eu_review_anthesis_final_study.pdf
What Toxic Substances are Present in Carpets according to the EU.Plasticisers: Phthalates.Alkyphenol Ethoxylates: Nonylphenols (NPs) Nonylphenol Ethoxylates (NPEOsBiocides: AntimicrobialsFlame RetardantsStain Repellents: Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASHeavy Metals & Metal CompoundsDyes and Pigments.Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) Other VOCs – “New Carpet Smell”. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC).Styrene Butadiene Rubber Latex (SBR Latex)Polyurethane
This potentially toxic combination used in carpeting was only produced since woollen carpeting was less aggressively marketed as a floor covering for insulation during the 1970’s although the performance of insulation using wool was three times more thermally efficient than ‘Nylon 6’ plastic acrylic carpeting insulation is.
Now any nylon carpeting dust is linked to many health concerns, and is regarded as a human toxic exposure if the dust particles and VOC gasses released are breathed into the lungs and consumed in food consumed. The nylon dust from walking and wear will become a ‘micro-plastic’ when we are walking outside and removed from our shoes then washed down drains by rain. Did we ever think of this?
Then we have now according to this UN press release below;https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1912/S00017/decade-ending-2019-likely-to-be-hottest-on-record.htmWednesday, 4 December 2019, 9:34 amPress Release: UN News“Exceptional global heat driven by greenhouse gas emissions mean this decade will most likely go down as the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which released its provisional statement on the State of the Global Climate on Tuesday.”
So if our every day use of plastics in ‘every walk of life’ is not checked for ‘micro-plastics’ then we are part of today’s problems that are causing climate change.
Big question is; - ‘How to firstly stop destructive loss of ocean oxygen’?
We have always advocated to Government for our transport to return using rail as our prime mover ‘of people and freight’ around our country.
With rail we have no transport tyre ‘micro-plastic’ emissions, as micro-plastics are seen as the worst enemy causing climate change in the articles above.
So less ‘transport micro-plastic dust’ is considered as a major plus - and only ‘steel wheels on a steel track’ will do the job to deal with Climate change, so if we lower the micro-plastics emissions in our environment we will make our lives healthy again then.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Saturn’s Moon Got Its Stripes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Astronomers have struggled to understand the origin of the parallel fractures on Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus, known as “tiger stripes,” from which water-ice spews into space. Now, a single explanation ties all the pieces together.
Saturn’s moon Enceladus is famous for its water-spewing geysers, an outward sign of an underground saltwater ocean. But the region that hosts the geysers — an area of so-called “tiger stripes” etched into the icy crust— has long puzzled astronomers.
The parallel stripes, about 35 kilometers (21 miles) apart, are located only at the moon’s south pole, and they’re unlike any features found on other icy moons. No scenario has simultaneously explained all of the stripes’ characteristics.
Now, Douglas Hemingway (Carnegie Institution for Science and University of California, Berkeley) and his colleagues publish an explanation in Nature Astronomy that covers all the bases.
The idea is simple in concept: Once a crack forms in Enceladus’s icy crust, it creates a cascade of fractures next to it.
Enceladus is known to go through cooling periods that thicken its icy crust. As its belowground water ocean freezes, it expands, exerting pressure from the inside. Because Enceladus’s crust is thinnest at its north and south poles, where Saturn’s gravitational pull creates the most heat, that’s where the crust breaks when it begins to pull apart.
Hemingway and colleagues suggest that Baghdad Sulcus, a stripe that cuts directly through the geographic south pole, formed in this way, a crack at the surface that eventually penetrated all the way through the ice shell. Water fills most of the crack, boiling off at the top in geyser-like fashion where it meets the vacuum.
This first crack relieved the pressure from the cooling, expanding ocean — that’s why there are no like fractures at the north pole. But the geyser erupting from this fracture snows water-ice down onto its flanks, building up a ridge on either side over time. The ridge becomes heavy enough to bend, and eventually break, the icy crust, creating another crack at a specific distance — 35 kilometers — from the first one.
This process continued to create stripes in symmetric pairs around Baghdad Salcus: first Cairo and Damascus, then Alexandria and a feature informally named “E.” Eventually, though, the cascade ends, either because there’s not enough eruption “snow” to build up ridges or because the ice crust becomes thick enough not to bend and break.
Scientists are commending this all-encompassing scenario. “[This study] corrals a host of observations of Enceladus' south polar terrain and its geysering activity with a rather simple idea,” says Carolyn Porco (Space Science Institute), who was not involved in the study but led the Cassini imaging team that discovered the stripes.
Frank Postberg (Free University Berlin), an expert on Enceladus who was also not involved in this study, agrees: “I think this is another important ‘milestone’ paper that solves one of the long-standing riddles Enceladus has been puzzling us with since the discoveries by Cassini in 2005.”
Not only that, Postberg adds, but the explanation that the authors propose also explains why such regular fractures occur only on Enceladus and not on other icy moons.
Hemingway explains that the cracks can only form on icy worlds with weak gravity. “After the secondary fracture starts to form, the load (the snow piled up on the edge of the previous fissure) is still there,” he explains. “That load has to be supported by an increasingly broken and therefore weaker ice shell.” So once a crack forms, it will break all the way through the ice unless something counteracts the stress. While tiny Enceladus doesn’t have enough gravity to hold a crack together, other icy moons — such as Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede — do.
The new scenario may help scientists understand other facets of Enceladus’s geology.  Porco, for one, is excited to see whether this process for creating regularly spaced cracks can also explain the regularly spaced geysers within those cracks. “I have long suspected that the geyser spacing is related to the ice shell structure,” Porco adds. “This may be a hint at exactly how that comes about. Another puzzle awaits the intrepid!”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Saturn’s Moon Enceladus Got Its Freaky ‘Tiger Stripes’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since 2005, scientists have puzzled over a series of long fissures seen in the southern regions of Saturn’s frozen moon Enceladus. New research explains how these so-called tiger stripes formed and why Enceladus is the only place in the solar system where these features could have emerged.
NASA’s Cassini spacecraft spotted the stripes in 2005, showing what appeared to be plumes of water shooting up from surface fractures, which were dubbed “tiger stripes” on account of their orderly appearance. The features were seen as evidence that a subsurface ocean existed under Enceladus’s icy crust, instantly making the Saturnian moon an important object of inquiry, not just from a geological perspective but from an astrobiological perspective as well.
New research published today in Nature Astronomy is the first to explain why these stripes are only located at the south pole and why the fissures run in parallel lines at roughly 35-kilometer (22-mile) intervals. Importantly, the new paper also explains why similar features have not been observed on other icy objects in the solar system, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa.
“Understanding the tiger stripes is important because these are the most active and dramatic ocean-to-surface pathways known on any of the icy ocean worlds in our solar system,” explained planetary scientist Douglas Hemingway, the first author of the study and a postdoc at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., in an email to Gizmodo. “My colleagues had previously thought about how to make the first fracture, but we still wanted to understand why there are multiple fractures and why they are roughly parallel.”
The fissures appear as four parallel lines measuring around 130 kilometers (80 miles) long. They’re in a perpetual state of eruption, spewing liquid water up from the subsurface ocean below.
Using computer models, and by applying concepts from linear elastic theory, the researchers were able to simulate how the ice shell responds to the gradual buildup of pressure on the surface. The research team also included Maxwell Rudolph from the University of California Davis and Michael Manga from Carnegie Institution for Science.
A crucially important factor in the process has to do with Enceladus’s highly eccentric orbit, which takes the moon far away from Saturn and then back again. The tidal stresses produced by this endless loop create heat, deforming the moon, which is why Enceladus is able to maintain liquid water underneath its icy crust.
These deformations are felt most strongly at the poles, where the ice is thinnest. At some point in the moon’s history, while it was going through a cool-down period, water froze beneath the caps. And because water expands when it freezes, this placed tremendous pressure on the crust, causing a gigantic crack to appear at the south pole.
That an initial crack first appeared at the south pole—a tiger stripe dubbed “Baghdad”—and not the north pole was simply a matter of chance, according to the new research. The primary fissure could’ve happened at either pole, but once the surface split open it wasn’t possible for a fissure to appear at the other pole. The “tensile stresses are thereby relieved, preventing a similar failure at the opposite pole,” wrote the authors in the study.
Importantly, the Baghdad fissure remained open due to Saturn’s gravity, allowing water from below to escape to the surface. All this water, which fell back down as ice and snow, resulted in the steady buildup of material along the edge of the fissure. Eventually, something had to give, resulting in the cracks seen 35 kilometers away on either side of the Baghdad fissure, where the depth of the ice was around 5.2 kilometers (3.2 miles) thick.
“We found that the maximum bending stresses occur 35 kilometers from the existing fracture when the ice shell has certain elastic properties,” said Hemingway.
With the two new fissures open and spewing out water, the process began anew in those locations. The “sequence of fissures then cascades outwards until the loading becomes too weak or the background shell thickness becomes too great to permit through-going fractures,” according to the study. In this case, the process resulted in a total of two secondary fissures and one tertiary fissure, dubbed Damascus, Cairo, and Alexandria (these names are borrowed from Arabian Nights).
According to the models, the tiger stripes could only happen on a moon with the mass of Enceladus, which measures roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter. Hemingway described this conclusion as one of the most interesting results of the study.
“For larger moons, the gravity is so strong that it overwhelms the bending stresses so that this kind of fracture would not be able to tear all the way through the ice shell,” he told Gizmodo. “This mechanism really only works when the gravity is very weak, which is the case for Enceladus. Even though that was not something we were originally looking to explain, it is arguably one of the most important questions about the tiger stripes.
In terms of next steps, Hemingway said it would be useful to simulate the tiger stripes with higher-resolution data to test their model, as the current study “used some simplifications and approximations” that made the surface seem “static and elastic,” and not as dynamic as in real life. Also, one of the predictions made in the study is that the secondary stripes are around 100,000 years, or possibly 1 million years, younger than the primary Baghdad fissure.
“It would be interesting to find a way to test that idea,” said Hemingway.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Enceladus’ Unique “Tiger Stripes” Make It A Prime Target In The Search For Life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cassini Space probe revealed Saturn's moon Enceladus as one of the most promising places in the Solar System to find life beyond Earth. Among the many mysteries about this 500 kilometer-wide (310 mile) ball of ice with a watery heart is why it is the only place we know to have a set of four “tiger stripes” across its south pole. These stripes are no mere curiosity, they're what gives us a chance to discover if life really does exist deep inside.
When water was found to be bursting forth from Enceladus' geysers a previously obscure and insignificant moon became a subject of intense interest. Liquid water is thought to be the underlying requirement of life, and we've since discovered Enceladus has some of the others as well.
The reason water survives within this moon when surface temperatures are -200º C (-325º F) was quickly established – the changing gravitational influence of Saturn and nearby moons causes internal heating, similar to what occurs within Jupiter's moons Io and Europa. However, planetary scientists were still puzzled as to how this water was reaching the surface, and ultimately space. A new paper in Nature Astronomy provides a likely answer.
The tiger stripes are around 135 kilometers (90 miles) long and quite thin, spaced around 35 kilometers (22 miles) apart. “What makes them especially interesting is that they are continually erupting with water ice, even as we speak. No other icy planets or moons have anything quite like them," said Dr Doug Hemingway of the Carnegie Institute in a statement. 
Hemingway has shown the deformation caused by the play of other objects' gravity on Enceladus is strongest at the poles, making the outer ice sheet thinnest there. The paper proposes the expansion of water at the top of the inner ocean as it freezes puts pressure on the icy shell, making an eventual split inevitable. The thinness at the poles makes them the point of vulnerability. Hemingway and co-authors don't think there is anything special about the south pole – it just happened to split before the north, and in the process released the moon-wide pressure.
Once the fissure named Bagdad that directly crosses the South pole opened, ocean water sloshed into it, bringing enough warmth to prevent refreezing. Ever since, sub-ice jets have created plumes of spray, sometimes escaping Enceladus' weak gravity entirely to form Saturn's E ring. Most, however, falls back onto the ice, building up until its pressure causes new breaks to form in parallel with the original.
Before the Voyager mission astronomers assumed the biggest moons would be the most interesting, but if Enceladus was much larger its gravity would be too great to prevent the fractures opening. If so, instead of future probes being able to sample the plumes we would have needed to drill through the ice to discover if life thrives underneath. Thankfully, it's already done that part for us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scientists create world’s first pig-monkey hybrid in China</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If there’s one thing sci-fi movies have taught us over the years, it’s that combining one animal with another animal almost always ends badly. Scientists in China aren’t trying to create mutant monsters, but they did create baby pigs with monkey cells. Yes, you read that correctly.
As NewScientist reports, a team of researchers from the State Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Reproductive Biology in Beijing set about creating the first pig-monkey chimeras. A chimera is any organism that includes living cells of different genotypes. Put simply, the researchers added monkey cells to pig embryos, allowed mature female pigs to carry those embryos to term and then observed the resulting piglets.
The team worked with over 4,000 embryos, all of which were implanted in sows. Of those thousands of embryos, just 10 of them resulted in a pregnancy that was carried to full term. The appearance of the piglets remained largely unchanged, but the scientists were able to observe the monkey cells, which were modified to fluoresce for easy visibility. Of the 10 piglets, only two of them were actually chimeras. Both of the piglets died within one week of being born. Their cause of death has not been determined.
This might all sound pretty grim and, to be honest, a bit creepy, but the goal of the research is actually rather interesting. The scientists are working toward the ability to grow human organs in pigs. The idea is that, with organ transplant wait lists claiming lives around the globe, ready-to-use human organs grown in pigs could offer a solution.
Saving human lives is a great thing, of course, but raising pigs stuffed with human guts only to kill them and harvest their innards raises some pretty serious ethical concerns. Nevertheless, the work continues, and while the deaths of the two piglets (and the low success rate in creating the chimeras) is a setback, this isn’t likely to be the last we hear of the project.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saturn's moon Enceladus' 'tiger stripes' mystery explained</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saturn's moon Enceladus has been shrouded in mystery since its discovery in the late 18th century, but now researchers believe they have solved what causes the moon's "tiger stripes," according to a new study.
The "tiger stripes," which were first spotted by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, are evenly spaced fissures, approximately 130 kilometers long and 35 kilometers apart. Icy material from Enceladus' ocean gets shot into them, an observation that has stumped scientists.
“First seen by the Cassini mission to Saturn, these stripes are like nothing else known in our Solar System,” the study's lead author, Doug Hemingway, said in a statement. “They are parallel and evenly spaced, about 130 kilometers long and 35 kilometers apart. What makes them especially interesting is that they are continually erupting with water ice, even as we speak. No other icy planets or moons have anything quite like them.”
NASA: SATURN'S MOON, ENCELADUS, COULD SUPPORT LIFE
Due to its odd orbit, Enceladus, the sixth-largest of Saturn's 62 confirmed moons, isn't frozen solid, despite it being icy. So it stretches the ice sheets, which are thin and easily split open, the researchers found. It just so happens the stripes on the south pole cracked ahead of those on the north pole.
The first stripe, named after the city of Baghdad, stayed open, causing the other stripes to become parallel. As the water rose from the first strip, the "stripes" formed.
“Our model explains the regular spacing of the cracks,” the study's co-author, Max Rudolph, added. He also pointed out that the weight of the icy material that falls back "caused the ice sheet to flex just enough to set off a parallel crack about 35 kilometers away.”
Hemingway and the other researchers noted that they've been able to study Enceladus' ocean, thanks to these fissures, which continue to widen and narrow over time.
“Since it is thanks to these fissures that we have been able to sample and study Enceladus’ subsurface ocean, which is beloved by astrobiologists, we thought it was important to understand the forces that formed and sustained them,” the researcher said. “Our modeling of the physical effects experienced by the moon’s icy shell points to a potentially unique sequence of events and processes that could allow for these distinctive stripes to exist.”
The research has been published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy.
SATURN MOON ENCELADUS IS FIRST ALIEN 'WATER WORLD' WITH COMPLEX ORGANICS
Enceladus continues to fascinate researchers. Earlier this year, researchers determined its ocean is likely 1 billion years old, placing it in the sweet spot for supporting life. Last year, researchers acknowledged that they had found the "building blocks" for life on Enceladus, having discovered complex organic molecules.
In 2017, NASA found the presence of hydrogen in its atmosphere, something Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at the time could be meaningful.
"It could be a potential source for energy from any microbes," Spilker said at the time. "We now know that Enceladus has almost all of the ingredients you would need for life here on Earth."
Enceladus is not the only celestial satellite of Saturn to intrigue scientists. In June, NASA announced the latest mission in its New Frontiers program. Known as Dragonfly, the mission will explore Saturn's largest moon, Titan, which could potentially host extraterrestrial life.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shocking photo of a colony of huntsman spiders living together found in Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A rare photo has emerged of a colony of huntsman spiders living together in nest boxes originally built for pygmy possums.
Non-profit organization Bush Heritage Australia published the photo of the group of arachnids on its blog, noting that they quickly moved into the boxes shortly after they were built.
"It all started about the same time we were finding Pygmy Possums in the boxes, but on lifting the lids of some we found many huntsman spiders of all sizes whizzing around inside," the non-profit wrote on its website.
1 MILLION 'CANNIBAL' ANTS FOUND TRAPPED IN SOVIET-ERA BUNKER USED TO STORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
"We now know that they're a species of huntsman that live together, normally under the bark of trees," Bush Heritage continued. "In the restored area tree bark is in short supply at present and they've found the wooden boxes suitable."
Huntsman spiders, which can grow nearly 1 foot in length, generally live in Australia, Africa and other temperate climates, according to a 2003 study.
According to the Australian Museum, these spiders, known for their size, speed and ability to hunt, can be dangerous to humans if bitten. However, attacks are rare, the museum added. Symptoms include swelling, pain, nausea and vomiting, The Sun notes.
'CRYPT-KEEPER' WASP ABLE TO CONTROL THE MINDS OF ITS VICTIMS
In June, a man staying at a lodge in Tasmania, Australia, witnessed a large huntsman spider eating what appeared to be a pygmy possum.
These spiders have also been known to take up residence in people's homes. In August, an Australian woman posted photos of a giant huntsman spider lurking in her home on Facebook before it was safely removed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 'meteor hurricane' caused civilisation collapse and another could wipe us out</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scientists have blamed the demise of several ancient civilisations on a ‘meteor hurricane’ caused by a dying comet.
In about 2350BC, there was a ‘near-simultaneous’ collapse which saw great societies crumble and the Middle East plunged into a dark age.
This resulted in the demise of the mighty Akkadian civilisation, which was founded by Sargon of Akkad and is sometimes called the first empire in history.
Researchers have now suggested this apocalypse may have been caused by an encounter with the debris thrown out by a disintegrating comet.
If a similar event took place today, modern human civilisation could be utterly destroyed and billions would die of starvation.
We all know about the risk posed by asteroids, which tend to be relatively solid and make from rock or metal.
Comets are huge clumps of ice and gas which sometimes fall apart as they are heated by the sun or are involved in some other event, such as a collision with other objects.
This can lead to the creation of a huge amount of material which can grow to the size of Earth ‘within days’, a new study has warned.
Our planet is much more likely to encounter this debris than it is to plough right into the comet’s nucleus, but this encounter can have ‘significant terrestrial effects’.
Fragments of rock or other material could rain down on Earth, starting fires and throwing so much soot into the air that the sun is blocked out.
They can also ‘dust’ the skies by dumping huge amounts of material into the atmosphere, which would also blot our star’s lifegiving light.
Both processes would also reduce temperatures across the planet.
Without light, there can be no photosynthesis and plants can longer grow, meaning it impossible for human civilisations to grow crops or for animals to feed themselves.
In a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, researcher W.M. Napier of Armagh University, Northern Ireland, wrote: ‘Studies of Earth’s history over the last 150,000 years have revealed that the climate is subject to sudden temperature changes, with transitions often taking place within decades or even a few years.
They added: ‘In modern times, a sudden global cooling of this kind would have a calamitous effect on agriculture.
‘The abrupt collapse of the Akkadian and other civilisations around 4,170 years before present has been attributed to a shift to more arid conditions, driving subsequent societal and political collapse.’
The author suggested this could have been caused by an encounter with a comet that was breaking apart to form Comet Encke – an object whose debris causes the Taurids meteor shower.
This may also have caused another mysterious cataclysm which took place in an era called the Younger Dryas Boundary roughly 12,800 years ago and left platinum-rich dust and glassy beads scattered around the world.
This event is likely to have been caused by a comet and sparked huge ‘global wildfires’ which burned up to 10% of the planet’s biomass and caused mass extinctions around the world.
‘I have modelled the disintegration of a large comet… using Comet Encke as an archetype and find there is a reasonable expectation of one or more brief ‘meteor hurricanes’ with intensities far beyond modern experience,’ the scientist added.
‘Enough… smoke may be created during such encounters to generate sudden coolings of some years’ duration, along with widespread wildfires.
‘The terrestrial upsets at the onset of the Younger Dryas Boundary of 12,900 before present and the simultaneous collapse of early civilisations around 2350BC may have been triggered by events of this character.’
The Akkadian Empire was a great civilisation centred around Akkad in Mesopotamia.
It was founded by Sargon of Akkad – which is now the name of a famous right-wing YouTuber – and flourished for almost two centuries before collapsing in the 22nd century BC.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Study sheds new light on supermassive black holes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Astronomers have discovered a unique way to weigh supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.
The method involves measuring the distances between the galaxies that contain them, and indicates supermassive black holes may not be as massive as previously thought.
Scientists believe that mysterious, massive dark objects that lurk at the centre of nearly all galaxies are black holes that can be observed with the right equipment.
They can have masses that can exceed a billion suns, according to the study published in Nature Astronomy.
Such supermassive black holes may power quasars, and may halt the formation of stars by releasing copious amounts of energy which heats up and fragments the gas in their host galaxies.
Researchers say they are tiny compared with their host galaxies – the size of a grape compared with the Earth.
But despite this, most observations suggest the bigger the galaxy, the bigger the supermassive black hole in it.
According to the astronomers, you would not expect the size of the black hole to know about the size of the galaxy it resides in, but there must be an intimate link between supermassive black hole growth and galaxy evolution.
This has not been proven, and in the study, the international team led by Dr Francesco Shankar of the University of Southampton, with Dr Viola Allevato at the Normale di Pisa and other partners in the US, Germany, Italy and Chile, set out to explain this link.
The masses of supermassive black holes are usually calculated by measuring the velocity of the surrounding stars or gas.
This is usually done with extremely sensitive telescopes and complex observations.
Dr Shankar said: “These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and growth of supermassive black holes.
“What we have discovered suggests a greater ability to release energy, and less strength in powering gravitational waves as supermassive black holes merge.”
Galaxies and their supermassive black holes are believed to reside in halos made of dark matter.
Numerical simulations show that more massive dark matter halos deviate more from a random spatial distribution – more strongly clustered.
Therefore, say the scientists, their clustering strength can be used to weigh the halos.
They expect more massive black holes to be hosted by more massive halos, so the clustering of the black holes can be used to estimate the masses of their hosts.
In turn this can be used to constrain the masses of the black holes themselves.
By comparing simulations with recent data on the spatial distribution of galaxies, the group found evidence that supermassive black holes are, on average, not as massive as previously thought.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk's SpaceX warned: Your internet-beaming satellites disrupt astronomy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpaceX's broadband project could severely disrupt space imaging and astroid detection.
Satellites cast into low Earth orbit by Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, are disrupting astronomy research due to the vehicles' brightness in night skies – and the problem could get much worse unless design changes are made.
SpaceX last month launched another 60 Starlink satellites on the back of a Falcon 9 rocket. They are intended to become part of a mesh network designed to deliver broadband to underserved areas across the world. There are about 120 orbiting Earth today, but there could be as many as 12,000 in the next few years. SEE: Sensor'd enterprise: IoT, ML, and big data (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)While Starlink promises to solve broadband speed and latency issues in rural areas in North America, the satellites are already causing interference for astronomy scientists across the globe because of their brightness. 
NewScientist reported that astronomers complained after the initial batch of 60 satellites were launched in May that they were extremely bright. While the fleet is small now, the astronomers are concerned that Musk's plans for several thousand broadband-beaming Starlink satellites could become a real problem for space imaging in the near future. 
A key observation point affected by Musk's satellites is the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), home to the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) and Gemini telescopes, which are located in the foothills of the Andes, 7,241 feet (2,200 meters) above sea level."I am in shock," wrote CTIO astronomer Clara Martinez-Vazquez on Twitter in November, referring to the Starlink satellites. "Our DECam exposure was heavily affected by 19 of them," she tweeted. "The train of Starlink satellites lasted for over five minutes."The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) in November issued a statement about the interference it expects Starlink satellites to cause for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which is under construction in Chile and expected to begin imaging the sky in 2022. The LSST will be used to detect near-Earth asteroids.  The LSST team estimates that "nearly every exposure within two hours of sunset or sunrise would have a satellite streak". In summer, it could have a massive affect on the telescope's ability to observe the sky during twilight.    "Detection of near-Earth asteroids, normally surveyed for during twilight, would be particularly impacted. Dark energy surveys are also sensitive to the satellites because of streaks caused in the images. Avoiding saturation of streaks is vital," the group warned. AURA has also posted two time-lapse videos that demonstrate the impact Starlink satellites are having on observability of space from Earth.  SpaceX says it is taking the astronomers concerns seriously. Per Spacenews.com, SpaceX chief operating officer Gwynn Shotwell said the next batch of Starlink satellites will have a "coating on the bottom", but added that it's not known whether the fix will solve the brightness problem. SEE: KT succeeds in linking 5G network to satelliteShotwell said SpaceX will launch 60 satellites every two to three weeks for the next year to deliver global coverage by around mid-2020. Elon Musk has said Space X needs about 400 satellites to provide "minor" coverage and 800 for "moderate" coverage of North America. The rocket company will be able to launch a global Starlink satellite broadband service after 24 additional launches, at which point the North American service is scheduled to be available. With 30 launches, SpaceX would have 1,800 Starlink satellites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turns Out A Wild Geoengineering Plan To Refreeze Arctic Sea Ice Isn't The Best Idea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the world spins closer to climate catastrophe, fringe ideas are inching toward the mainstream. Geoengineering is among the topics that were once verboten but are now finding traction. And that includes some pretty out-there ideas, including ones focused on saving polar ice by pumping massive amounts of seawater onto the surface of ice, where it will refreeze quicker and strengthen all icepack against melting.
The refreezing idea has been proposed for both poles and would be massively expensive. But a new study shows that, in the Arctic, saving sea ice would do little to slow the climate crisis elsewhere. And it would unleash shocking and unintended consequences in the Arctic itself.
The paper, published in Earth’s Futures on Thursday, takes its inspiration from a previous study that first raised the prospect of an Arctic geoengineering project. That study outlined a proposal to install wind turbines across the Arctic that would power pumps to draw water to the surface of the remaining sea ice, where it would refreeze more quickly than from the bottom-up.
Sounds a little bit (OK, a lot) radical to be sure, but the rapidly warming Arctic needs all the help it can get. Old sea ice that used to hold the icepack together is all but gone, and we could see an ice-free Arctic as early as the next decade if carbon pollution isn’t slowed soon.
But while the previous research showed it was technologically feasible to do the wind turbine thing, it didn’t look too hard at what the climate ramifications would be. The new paper picks up at that point because, as Lorenzo Zampieri, the new study’s lead author and PhD student at Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, told Earther, “this geoengineering idea had never been tested with a climate model and, in our opinion, this was a necessary step to contextualise this approach.”
The scientists used an advanced climate model to explore what the scheme would actually do to the Arctic. They modelled a number of scenarios, including one idealised scenario in which seawater was pumped over the entirety of the sea ice. That model found that ice would grow up to 65 metres thick over the rest of the century, a huge change from the average historical thickness of 1.8 metres.
They dialled things back to a bit more “realistic” scenario that aimed for an average thickness of around 2 metres and moderately spaced out wind mills and pumps. The good news: It would indeed help refreeze.
But the less good news is that the process would radically alter the climate in the Arctic while doing very little to fix the global climate overall. Healthy, reflective ice that lasts through the summer would restore the late summer Arctic climate to some semblance of its former self.
Pumping throughout the winter, however, would result in an unintended warming for parts of the Arctic in the latter half of the century. That’s because as the ice freezes, it releases energy in the form of heat. Layer that on top of the warmth from global warming, and you have a recipe for a very confusing Arctic winter.
Oh, and speaking of that global warming: While saving Arctic sea ice is great for polar bears and the people who live there, it does just about jack shit for the climate globally. The mid-latitudes, where most humans live, would see just a few hundredths of a degree of cooling as a result. That’s nice and all, but it ain’t gonna do much to save the coral, stop wildfires from burning out of control, or keep people from dying.
This type of modelling will be crucial in the coming decade to understand the options we have on the table. Other forms of geoengineering, like blocking sunlight or undertaking massive reforestation projects to suck carbon out of the air, are also gaining steam as the climate we so rely on keeps unravelling.
There’s a seductiveness to thinking we can just implement a few techno fixes to buy time while the world gets its act together drawing down emissions, but the reality is they will almost surely come with tradeoffs and gnarly surprises of their own.
“I would like to point out that, according to our findings, this approach could only buy some decades to the Arctic sea ice, while a permanent solution can only be achieved by reducing the excess of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and cooling the climate,” Zampieri said.
That’s right. The best thing we could do for the climate and future generations is the one the world has so far failed at. It might not be as sexy as building huge wind turbines in the Arctic, but it damn well gives us a better chance at survival.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">70 years of research shows that the only established adverse health effect of RF energy (above 100KHz) is thermal effect and will not cause cancer or any other diseases

The fifth generation of cellular technology or 5G promises greater capacity, 10 to 100 times faster download speeds than 4G, low latency for internet of things, robotics, autonomous vehicles and remote medical applications but it has raised concerns about the possible health effects of radio-frequency (RF) energy transmitted by 5G base stations and devices.
The overall electromagnetic spectrum consists of static electricity and magnetic fields, RF, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray and Gamma Rays.
RF is in the middle part of the spectrum and is used for radio communications, mobile phone networks, mobile base stations and mobile phones and to deliver 3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies.
Non-ionising radiation (static field to infrared) does not carry enough energy to break molecular bonds. Ionising radiation (ultraviolet to Gamma rays) carries enough energy to break bonds between molecules and ionise atoms.
5G systems operate in several frequency bands, low, mid and in millimetre waves (24.25GHz to 86GHz).
Millimetre-wave is one area which has raised concerns apart from the multitude of small cells mounted on utility poles along public streets and close to subscribers but this spectrum has been used in many other applications such as airport security scanners and anti-collision radars for automobiles but now the millimetre wave is used for cellular communications by many countries.
Delegates, speaking at the ‘UAE 5G Conference’, said that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level (under the current international exposure guidelines developed by ICNIRP and IEEE-ICES) electromagnetic fields (EMFs).
They emphasised, based on many experiments and studies, that there is no negative impact of modern technology on health.
ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection) and International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (IEEE-ICES) set guidelines for protecting people from non-ionising radiation, including that due to exposure of 5G technologies.
Countries typically adopt one of these and either recommended or legally require adherence to the guidelines. Safety standards already have large safety margins.
Dr. Chung Kwang Chou, Chairman of International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (IEEE), said that common understanding is that radiation can cause cancer and other diseases but the biological effects of RF exposure have been studied for about 70 years and the research shows that the only established adverse health effect of RF energy (above 100KHz) is thermal effect.
Dr. Jafar Keshwari, Adj Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Aalto University, Helsinki, and Corporate Product Regulations and Standards Management at Intel Corporation and Chairman of International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (IEEE-ICES), said that EMF exposure of a mobile device is much lower than other devices.
“During RF exposure, biological effects always exist but adverse health effect depends on the exposure level. Thermal effects continue to be the appropriate basis for protection against RF exposure health effects at frequencies above 100KHz,” he said.
As long as the product complies with the exposure limit, he said that it is safe. 
For mobile phones, 2Watt per kilogram is the limit and the adverse effects are observed when it reaches 100Watt per kilogram.
“So there is a large safety factor in the exposure limits. It is the regulator’s responsibility to check that every product put into the market, device or a base station, complies with the limits. The manufacturer has to assess the exposure based on the limits,” he said.
Moreover, he said the main safety concerns of 5G mmWaves is heating of the skin and eyes.
“Skin constitutes 95% of the human body surface while eye cornea constitutes 75% of freshwater and a thickness of 0.5mm. Millimetre waves are absorbed within about 0.5 mm of the skin surface, unlike RF energy at lower frequencies that can penetrate deeper into the tissue,” he said.
Whatever frequency you are at, Professor Rodney Croft, Commissioner at ICNIRP, said that the safety depends on how intensity the field is or how much energy is absorbed into the body per second.
“If we have a lot of energy per second, then you heat up and your body cannot remove that heat. The body can remove a small amount of energy as the blood supply takes the heat and distributes it and the blood flow exchanges the heat with the environment. This happens with all the frequencies and only if you at get much higher frequency, then it gets to ionising radiation and at that point, we have a very different story,” he said.
Below the optical radiation (non-ionising) levels, Croft said the frequency is not important for health, expect it tells you how deep the penetration is going to be.
So, when listening or not-listening to FM radio or music, he said that radio signals are going around and they are in low frequency (100MHz) all the time.
“That goes deep into your body. As the frequency gets higher, because the wavelength is much shorter, it gets absorbed in the superphysical part of the body. When it comes to 5G, almost all of the energy is absorbed in the skin. So, instead of a rise in temperature deep inside the body, it is now at the surface of the skin,” he said.
Even the worst-case effect of exposure will not cause cancer or any other diseases; he said and added that the local temperature increases to less than 0.5 degrees but no detectable increase to core body temperature.
“Even if you keep a block of wood or a toy close to the ears for some time, the skin temperature near the ears rise and it is not due to RF exposure but due to lack of air circulation.
However, if you are close to the base station, he said the body absorbs more heat but the guidelines take that into account and you have a boundary limit, a safe distance from the base station.
“It all depends on the power of the base station. In reality, you can go above the limits but you still won’t be hurt but it is better for us to have a very conservative limit than to get too close to a level where someone could be harmed,” he said.
Furthermore, he said that community fears hinder 5G implementation but guidelines are needed to ensure unambiguous safety to the community.
For example, India, Switzerland, etc. restrict exposures based on fear rather than science.
“5G exposures will be far lower than the guidelines allow and there is no detectable increase to core body temperature or local temperature increase from towers or handsets.” 
So, he said that 5G safety will not affect developments of IoT, blockchain, AI, quantum computing, smarty city, etc.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The hunt for dark matter—and the associated particles and forces that we expect to accompany it—has turned up numerous false dawns over the years. Try as we might, any evidence of what makes up this invisible form of matter—thought to be the vast majority of matter in the known universe—has remained elusive. But a team of Hungarian researchers suggested in 2015 that they had found a particle, dubbed X17, that possibly interacted with dark matter in some way. Recently, in a second experiment, the team says it has fresh evidence for the X17 particle, which would change physics as we know it. But not everyone is convinced, and new experimental plans are afoot to root out the truth.
In a paper posted on the preprint server arXiv.org, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, Attila Krasznahorkay of the Institute for Nuclear Research (also known as Atomki) at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and his colleagues report the new findings. Back in 2015 the team observed the decay of beryllium-8 nuclei and found that pairs of electrons and positrons (electrons’ antimatter counterparts) ejected in the process were consistent with the additional decay of a mysterious extra particle, the X17 particle, with a mass of about 17 million electron volts (MeV). Now the researchers say they have seen evidence for this particle again but this time in the decay of helium-4 nuclei. “We studied the decay of high-energy nuclear states, first of all in beryllium-8 and then, more recently, in helium-4,” Krasznahorkay says. “We got a short difference between the prediction and the experimental data, an anomaly. In order to understand this anomaly, we assumed a new particle, which is created in the atomic nucleus and ejected, then decays to electron-positron pairs.”
The experimental setup at Atomki involves bombarding a target with protons to examine its nuclear decay. This technique is somewhat different than the usual methods of particle detection such as at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva, which smashes particles together at high energies and observes the resultant particles emitted in the collision. The Atomki process, however, provides a unique method to look for unexpected particles. The scale of 17 MeV is “difficult to probe using the Large Hadron Collider, which tends to be operating at a much higher energy,” says Jesse Thaler of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Theoretical Physics, who was not involved in the experiment.
Since the Hungarian team published its first paper back in 2015, other scientists have tried and failed to find evidence for the X17 particle. An outside analysis in 2016, however, suggested that if this particle truly exists, it could be evidence for a supposed “fifth force” of nature, specifically related to dark matter. “This fifth force really means there is a new particle that intermediates new interactions, or new forces,” says Daniele Alves, a particle physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who was not involved in the Hungarian team’s work. “It’s possible that this particle is part of a larger ‘dark sector,’ meaning it could also interact with dark matter particles. It could be a portal to this sector.”
Matt Strassler, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University, who also wasn’t involved in Hungarian team’s studies, notes this particle would be “a window into some aspect of the universe that we are completely unaware of,” with huge implications. “Not only would it be obviously Nobel Prize–winning because it would be a new [fundamental] particle, but this particular particle doesn’t fit into the existing table of particles,” he says. “The Standard Model, all of the existing elementary particles, form sort of a closed book. [But] X17 interacts with matter much more weakly. And that’s an indication that it’s not part of the structure of the Standard Model. Its interactions with matter are through some other story we don’t know yet.”
The existence of this particle is anything but a certainty, however. The fact that only the Hungarian team has been able to spot it so far has raised alarm bells for some scientists, suggesting the data could be explained by a fault in its experimental setup. And Strassler notes that the supposed properties of the particle require it to have some odd characteristics. “To set up mathematical equations where you have a particle that interacts with neutrons and electrons more than with protons and neutrinos turns out to be not so simple to do,” he says. “This just makes the story somewhat implausible.”
That assessment does not mean other scientists are not trying to look for X17, however. The NA64 collaboration at CERN has previously tried and failed to find signs of the particle. But when upgrades to the LHC are complete in the next year or so, scientists plan to use the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, which studies another particle known as the beauty quark, to see if the mysterious X17 turns up. “The LHCb experiment, based on our study, should have been able to collect enough data [by 2023] in order to make a definitive statement about the X17 [particle],” Thaler says.
Alves and her colleagues are exploring the possibility of using Los Alamos to search for the particle, too. “We are investigating whether some of the studies that Los Alamos does for other purposes could also be repurposed to look for signs of this new particle,” says Alves, who notes that their method of searching would be somewhat different from the Hungarian team’s. “The Hungarians looked at two nuclear transitions, one in beryllium-8 and one in helium-4,” she says. “We will be looking at the production of particles in neutron-capture reactions, when a neutron is captured by another nucleus, and in the process, it might emit things. The most common thing it might emit is a photon, but it could also possibly emit this new X17 particle.”
Although skepticism remains high, there is still considerable excitement at the possibility of the X17 particle. It may take years until we know for sure if it really exists, but if it does, it would herald an entirely new branch of physics and a chance to peer into the unknown. “Of course, I’m confident [that it exists],” Krasznahorkay says. “But I’ve got strong critics.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">A gigantic asteroid will fly over the Earth during the Holidays</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A gigantic asteroid will pass close to the Earth a few days before Christmas, according to NASA.
The space object - which answers to the name of 216258 (2006 WH1) - is being tracked by NASA’s Centre for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).
The object has been designated an Apollo asteroid - which means its orbit intersects with Earth as we orbit the Sun.
The space agency said it is one of the biggest asteroids in sight this year, the Daily Star reported.
The rock is taller than the Empire State Building, which means it has been classed a ‘potentially hazardous asteroid’ (PHA).
If an asteroid is bigger than 35 meters, it is then considered a threat to towns and cities and could also trigger massive tsunamis, should it hit the ocean.
However, the risk of 216258 (2006 WH1) crashing to Earth is minimal, as it will follow a course 3.6million miles from the Earth’s core.
Major asteroid collisions only happen once every 100,000 years on average, almost guaranteeing humanity a spatial catastrophy-free Christmas 2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">China put the world’s largest single-dish radio telescope, which is 500 metres wide, into operation in 2016. Three years later, the testing period is drawing to an end. But the development of the unique object, called the Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and is hoped will find extraterrestrial intelligence, continues.
The trial period of China’s Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), said to be the biggest in the world, is successfully drawing to a close, as the 500-metre “dish” has detected 99 pulsars (rapidly spinning neutron stars), Chinese media reports.
The findings of the unique object, launched in 2016 in southwest Guizhou Province, include more than 30 fast-rotating millisecond pulsars, which are hard to detect. But apart from distant stars, the telescope is also looking for a signal from alien intelligence.
However, the researcher explained that this is no easy task, but “a huge amount of work”, as 99% of signals are different noises. Identifying much-needed signals therefore takes time.
However, FAST’s observation modes keep developing, as scientists continue to work on new receiving equipment, as Space.com points out. Chinese researchers hope that the telescope’s abilities will continue to improve.
The team working at the object has brought together more than 100 astronomers to discuss the discoveries made during the three-year testing period.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The space agency said they launched the mission to study the asteroid Bennu in 2016. Samples from the celestial body would not only shed light on how planets formed and life began, but also give a better understanding of how to protect our planet from an asteroid collision.
NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission made a surprising discovery when it spotted plumes of particles coming from the surface of the asteroid Bennu. The finding is not only rare, but is the first time that scientists observed particles being ejected from the surface of an asteroid up-close. It also proves that Bennu is an active asteroid.
OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer, “met” Bennu last year and the mission has been orbiting the asteroid ever since. The discovery itself was made in January this year, but scientists presented their observations in a study just days ago, on 6 December.
According to OSIRIS-REx’s science team, the eruptions of particles occurred in different places on the asteroid. The first event was spotted in its southern hemisphere, while a second and a third originated near Bennu's equator. The particles were released from the surface, briefly orbited Bennu and then fell back or flew into space. They travelled at a speed of 3 metres per second and measured from smaller than an inch to 10 cm.
The team then examined mechanisms that could lead to these mysterious ejections. They concluded that it could be due to:
Scientists note that identifying the exact mechanism that leads to ejections of particles will be quite difficult.
Many of the particles are small enough for OSIRIX-REx to collect them and deliver to Earth and further study of these particles and samples from Bennu will help scientists better understand asteroids – their similarities and differences – as well as ways to deflect asteroids if they are set on a collision course with our planet. Bennu, which is categorised as a near-Earth object could pass our planet closer than the Moon in 2135, with even closer approaches possible in 2175 and 2195. Meanwhile, OSIRIS-REx will start collecting samples from Bennu in the summer of 2020 and is scheduled to return them to Earth in 2023.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ESA to fund world's first space debris removal mission</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dec. 9 (UPI) -- The European Space Agency has agreed to fund a mission to remove a piece of space debris -- the first of its kind -- as part of the agency's new Space Safety program.
The mission, announced Monday, will be executed by a consortium of aerospace companies, led by the Swiss startup Clearspace, which was founded by a group of space debris researchers working at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne research institute, EPFL.
ESA expects the mission to launch in 2025.
"This is the right time for such a mission," Luc Piguet, founder and CEO of ClearSpace, said in a news update from ESA. "The space debris issue is more pressing than ever before. Today we have nearly 2,000 live satellites in space and more than 3,000 failed ones."
Currently, scientists with the U.S. military and space agencies around the globe use tracking data and probability models to help active government-owned and private satellites avoid pieces of junk. But the problem of space debris is getting worse.
The growth of the private space industry and the shrinking of satellite technology has made it cheaper and easier to launch a satellite than ever before. Every year, hundreds of new satellites are sent into space.
Many experts predict low Earth orbit will eventually become so crowded that more interventionist methods will be necessary -- in other words, debris removal.
To demonstrate the feasibility of space debris removal, engineers with the ClearSpace-1 mission will launch a four-armed robotic junk collector to retrieve Vespa, a small satellite launched by ESA in 2013. Vespa, though defunct, remains in orbit around Earth at a distance of 497 miles.
At a meeting held in Seville, Spain, at the end of November, ESA leaders agreed that the growing problem of space junk required action.
"Imagine how dangerous sailing the high seas would be if all the ships ever lost in history were still drifting on top of the water," said ESA Director General Jan Wörner. "That is the current situation in orbit, and it cannot be allowed to continue. ESA's Member States have given their strong support to this new mission, which also points the way forward to essential new commercial services in the future."
Space agencies, aerospace companies and a variety of research institutions continue to work to improve guidelines for space launches in order minimize the impacts of new satellites and spacecraft on low Earth orbit congestion.
But even if all launches were called off today, low Earth orbit will continue to get increasingly dangerous for active satellites. When pieces of debris collide and break apart, the shrapnel scatters and increases the odds of future collisions -- a cascading effect.
Data collected by the U.S. government shows congestion in low Earth orbit gets worse every day.
"We're at a tipping point right now," John Crassidis, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Buffalo, told UPI earlier this year.
Some space junk experts suggest low Earth orbit, LEO, could become overwhelmed by space debris within 50 years.
Once the ClearSpace-1 mission probe grabs Vespa, it will fall back into Earth's atmosphere and burn up. Such a technique for debris removal isn't economically sustainable. Experts hope future cleanup probes will be able to grab a piece of junk, deposit into the atmosphere and continue on to collect more debris.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian cargo ship docks at International Space Station</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dec. 9 (UPI) -- The International Space Station is running out of docking ports. Russia's Progress 74 cargo ship, which linked up with ISS early Monday morning, is one of five craft attached to the space station.
The cargo ship automatically attached itself to the Pirs docking compartment on the Russian segment at 5:35 a.m. ET.
"The Progress 74 spacecraft is carrying almost three tons of food, fuel and supplies for the Expedition 61 crew aboard the station," according to NASA. "Progress will arrive after making 49 orbits of Earth in three days since its launch Friday."
The Russian cargo ship joined the space station as the two craft sailed over the Yellow Sea, east of Shanghai, at an altitude of 260 miles.
Russian cosmonauts Alexander Skvortskov and Oleg Skripochka oversaw -- but did not need to intervene in -- the automatic docking.
The space station's crew has lots of unpacking to do, as another vessel, SpaceX's Dragon cargo ship, arrived on Sunday morning, bringing with it 2.5 tons of supplies and science gear.
Both dockings were broadcast live on NASA TV.
A third cargo vessel, the U.S. Cygnus spacecraft built by Northrop Grumman, remains attached to to the space station, having arrived in early November. Two Soyuz crew capsules, waiting to ferry astronauts home, are also docked at the space station.
NASA considers the space station an important bridge to the Artemis program, the effort to return astronauts to the surface of the moon.
"As the only place for conducting long-duration research on how living in microgravity affects living organisms as well as testing technologies to allow humans to work at the Moon, the space station serves as a unique asset in the effort establish a sustainable presence at the Moon and prepare for missions to Mars," NASA wrote in an update.
At 9 a.m. ET, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstein will provide a live update to the agency's Artemis program progress at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Air pollution exposure worsens lung function in current, former smokers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dec. 9 (UPI) -- The dangers of smoking are well known, but a new study suggests the habit is likely being made even more hazardous by air pollution.
In a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers report that long-term exposure to ozone in the atmosphere has significant effects on lung function, particularly among heavy smokers.
Indeed, smokers living in urban or heavily industrialized regions, where ozone levels are generally higher, were more likely to be diagnosed with emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders and have more severe disease than non-smokers, they say.
"COPD is known to be caused by exposure to harmful particles and gases, and individuals with existing COPD who are exposed to higher amounts of pollution often have worse disease," study co-author Laura Paulin, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, told UPI.
The U.S. Clean Air Act was modified in 2015 to strengthen air-quality standards. The change reduced acceptable ozone levels in the air from 75 parts per billion, or ppb, to 70 ppb.
Although dozens have studies have assessed the risk of short-term ozone exposure, few to date have reviewed the risks associated with "historical" exposure, Paulin and her colleagues said.
For their research, they reviewed data from 1,874 current and/or former smokers living in seven cities -- New York City; Baltimore; Los Angeles; Ann Arbor, Michigan; San Francisco; Salt Lake City; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina -- who participated in the Sub-populations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study, looking at their lung health following "ambient" ozone exposure over a 10-year period.
The authors predicted two-week mean outdoor concentrations of ozone outside each participant's home using spatio-temporal modeling methods, which incorporated pollutant concentrations previously measured by the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution Air Study in Baltimore, New York City, Los Angeles, and Winston-Salem; monitoring by the New York City Community Air Study; and regulatory agencies in all seven communities.
Lung function was assessed by multiple methods, including forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration, or the FEV1, a test used to measure airflow obstruction. It is designed to calculate the amount of air a person can force out of their lungs in one second, with 75 percent considered normal.
In all, more than 65 percent of the study participants had been diagnosed with COPD.
The median two-week ozone concentration of study participants was 25.1 ppb, and ranged from 16.3 ppb in New York City to 29.1 ppb in Salt Lake City. Overall, greater 10-year ozone exposure concentration among current and former smokers was associated with a -2.50 percent lower score on the FEV1.
People "with underlying lung disease and other illnesses who may be more susceptible to the health effects of air pollution exposure should follow publicly available air pollution alerts, available at airnow.gov, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure on high alert days," Paulin said.
"Minimizing exposure to other known pollutants, such as cigarette smoke and other particulates, is also important in order to reduce overall exposure to harmful air pollution, especially in individuals with COPD," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Satellites are changing the night sky</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK – Expect the night sky to start changing fast. One day soon, the stars we can see from Earth could be outnumbered by a vast swarm of satellites.
While many people today live under the murk of light pollution, we can at least still travel to a glittering night sky in the mountains, the desert or at sea. But if communications technology follows its current trajectory, anyone who wants to escape the byproducts of human activity might have to go to the moon.
Some professional astronomers raised alarms last spring, and again in November, after SpaceX launched batches of 60 Starlink satellites. These don’t present a big problem yet, but when thousands more shine down on us, they could interfere with our ability to detect the farthest, faintest objects in the universe — the ones that give us a portal into the distant past. The wider effect will be on amateur sky watchers, campers, sailors, dreamers, poets, children, visionaries and anyone else who has ever been moved by the sparkle of the Milky Way set against the dark mystery of space.
We’re entering a second space age now, 70 years after the start of the first one, says space historian and astrophysicist Jonathan MacDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The cost of launching things into space is finally cheap, so the number of things in space is going to explode.
SpaceX has plans to launch 30,000 more satellites, in addition to the 12,000 already approved by the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation Administration. MacDowell predicts that other companies are likely to launch “mega constellations” of their own satellites. The result could be cheap or free high speed internet access for everyone on the planet, at the price of our view of timeless constellations.
Some communication can be done with much higher, less obtrusive satellites in geostationary orbit, he explains, but those can’t get enough bandwidth to offer everyone video streaming. For that we need the satellites in low Earth orbit, where they will parade across our view.
The sky will become even more cluttered if Jeff Bezos, who heads space venture Blue Origin, carries out his plan to move heavy industry into space — an endeavor that would require hundreds of thousands of much larger, brighter satellites, says MacDowell.
“Our concern is about our connection to the universe,” says Ruskin Hartley, the president of the International Dark-Sky Association. His group, which has been active in trying to decrease earthbound light pollution, has also taken a stand on the space-based kind. While there are billions and billions of stars out there, our eyes can pick up just 10,000 or so from a relatively dark place, he says, so soon our view could be “twinkling with satellites.”
MacDowell says his calculations suggest that even a modest 30,000 satellites would profoundly change the view from Earth. Astronomers say that number will start to complicate their work as well, especially an ambitious project known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will take wide-field images of the sky from Chile in an attempt to penetrate the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy and the origin of galaxies. Will public enthusiasm for such ventures deflate when the rest of us no longer look at the stars and wonder where it all came from and where it’s all going?
Is it selfish to want to keep our night sky, knowing some people still don’t have internet access? Maybe. But many of the disconnected surely feel a connection to the night sky, too.
MacDowell says one good compromise solution would be an international agreement, similar to a space junk pact negotiated through the Interagency Space Debris Coordination Committee. Through that agreement, companies with plans to launch satellites now design them so they fall to Earth after 25 years. A similar agreement might encourage people to design satellites with minimal impact on our view.
While the satellites themselves can help connect people to one another, the stars can also help us feel a connection — to others around the world and to people throughout history who have gazed upward and been inspired. More than half of the world’s population now uses the internet, and it shouldn’t be too hard to wire up the rest without sacrificing the sky. We humans will inevitably achieve complete connectedness, but without our shared sense of being in the cosmos, we could end up with less of interest to say.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Parker Solar Probe Scientists Reveal Jaw-Dropping First Results From the Sun</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, scientists released the surprising initial results from the Parker Solar Probe’s first two close encounters with the Sun.
From 36 solar radii away, it’s already clear that our Sun is a chaotic beast full of surprises, with solar winds circling it faster than expected, rapidly reversing magnetic fields, and blobs of plasma spewing from its corona. These first four papers have already generated new mysteries and demonstrate just how much science is yet to come from the Parker Solar Probe.
“I wasn’t counting on seeing surprising things this soon,” Justin Kasper, principal investigator of the Parker Solar Probe’s Solar Wind Electron Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) instrument, told Gizmodo. “There’s clearly not going to be a dull moment as we get closer and closer.”
The Parker Solar Probe launched in August 2018 to much fanfare. Its researchers are hoping to learn why the Sun’s outer atmosphere, also known as its corona, has temperatures over a million degrees Celsius while its surface is just a few thousand degrees Celsius. They also want to understand the process by which the corona emits the energetic particles we call the solar wind. The probe carries a suite of imaging, particle-measuring, and electromagnetic field-measuring instruments protected by an advanced carbon foam and ceramic heat shield.
The probe used Venus’s gravity to fling itself into an eccentric orbit that carries it faster and brings it closer to the Sun than any previous mission. After releasing data publicly in November, scientists are now presenting the results of the first two close encounters, which occurred in November 2018 and April 2019 and brought the spacecraft within 36 solar radii of the Sun. Their findings appear in four papers published last week in Nature.
Perhaps the most dramatic discovery was the intricate details of the solar wind, which loses complexity as it travels toward Earth. The electromagnetic field-measuring FIELDS instrument observed jets of plasma punctuating a quieter solar wind emanating from a hole in the corona, producing regions where the magnetic field quickly whips around, according to the paper. In these regions, it’s as if you had entered a place where your compass needle begins flipping between south and north. The Sun is generating this solar wind structure even during the present solar minimum, when the Sun is supposed to be least active.
Observing the behaviours of the particles themselves with SWEAP revealed spikes in particle velocity associated with these magnetic field flips that occurred a thousand times over the course of one 11-day observation period. Furthermore, the particles’ rotational movement around the Sun peaked at between 35 and 50 kilometres per second, around 10 times faster than previously predicted based on the Sun’s own rotation, according to the paper. Imagine arriving at a carousel and seeing the outermost animal travelling inexplicably fast; you’d be confused, too. Since the solar wind should be pulling energy away from the Sun, these high-velocity particles suggest that the Sun’s own rotation should be slowing down at a higher rate, too; it’s another mystery for scientists to figure out.
Imaging of the sunlight scattered by electrons and dust particles taken by the Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe instrument, or WISPR, mostly confirmed observations from Earth, with less scattering farther from the Sun. However, a drop-off in the scattering closer to the Sun seems to suggest evidence of a theorised but never observed “dust-free” zone. These observations also show evidence of the complex structure of the corona itself, with blobs of particles emanating from the corona. There was also evidence of twisted tubes of magnetic field called flux ropes, and, for the first time, evidence of ellipses of magnetic field called magnetic islands, which are generated by the energetic consequences of magnetic field lines crossing and rearranging, according to the research.
Finally, analysis of the particles above the corona using the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument, or ISʘIS, seems to show evidence of many more smaller particle emission events that we can’t see from the Earth. These smaller events may eventually cascade into the larger or higher-energy events that we do see, said David McComas, vice president of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The team sees the particles accelerating in different ways, both directly from magnetic field lines reconnecting in the corona, from shocks, and even from smaller compression waves, the authors write. Accelerations from compression waves haven’t been seen before.
Overall, these results will help us understand the solar wind and space weather overall, as well as how particles are accelerated and move around the solar environment, Mitzi Adams, solar scientist at the NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center who was not involved in the work, told Gizmodo in an email.
And all of this is just from two flybys.
“This suggests that we can expect much more high-quality observations over the next six years of the Parker Solar Probe’s lifetime,” Reka Winslow, research assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire who was not involved in the analyses, told Gizmodo in an email. She explained that one of the biggest hindrances to understanding solar processes is the lack of data from the solar environment. “The more high-quality data we have, the higher the chance that we can conclusively answer some of the big questions still remaining in heliophysics.”
These missions show that a lot of information gets lost as particles make the journey between the Sun and Earth – data that the Parker Solar Probe will be able to record from its closer vantage point. Another mission from the European Space Agency, the Solar Orbiter, will soon join the Parker Solar Probe with its own suite of complementary instruments, Daniel Verscharen, senior research fellow at University College London, noted in a Nature commentary. “These joint measurements will certainly close some of the remaining gaps in our knowledge of the Sun and the solar wind.”
The Sun will only grow more active as it continues from its current solar minimum to its maximum and back over an 11-year cycle, likely throwing even more surprises at the probe’s various instruments. Said Kasper: “I can’t even imagine what things are going to look like when we get three times closer.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA’s Parker probe reveals new solar oddities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The closest-ever look inside the sun’s corona has unveiled an unexpectedly chaotic world, according to researchers from NASA’s Parker Solar Probe mission.
That world includes rogue plasma waves, flipping magnetic fields, and distant solar winds under the thrall of the sun’s rotation.
The findings, part of the first wave of results from the spacecraft that launched in August 2018, provide important insights into two fundamental questions the mission aimed to answer: Why does the sun’s corona get hotter as your move further away from the surface? And what accelerates the solar wind—an outward stream of protons, electrons, and other particles emanating from the corona?
Both questions have ramifications for how we predict, detect, and prepare for solar storms and coronal mass ejections that can have dramatic impacts on Earth’s power grid and on astronauts.
“Even with just these first orbits, we’ve been shocked by how different the corona is when observed up close,” says Justin Kasper, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan who serves as principal investigator for Parker’s Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) instrument suite.
“These observations will fundamentally change our understanding of the sun and the solar wind and our ability to forecast space weather events.”
Four papers in Nature outline the findings from data collected during the spacecraft’s first two encounters with the sun. Kasper led one of the studies and is coauthor of two others (one, two).
The papers describe Parker’s unprecedented near-sun observations through two record-breaking close flybys, which exposed the spacecraft to intense heat and radiation. They reveal new insights into the processes that drive the solar wind—the constant outflow of hot, ionized gas that streams outward from the sun and fills up the solar system—and how the solar wind couples with the sun’s rotation.
Through these flybys, the mission also has examined the dust in the environment of the sun’s atmosphere, or corona, and spotted particle acceleration events so small that they are undetectable from Earth, which is nearly 93 million miles from the sun.
During its initial flybys, Parker studied the sun from a distance of about 15 million miles. That is already closer to the sun than Mercury, but the spacecraft will get even closer in the future, as it travels at more than 213,000 mph, faster than any previous spacecraft.
Among the findings are new understandings of how the sun’s constant outflow of solar wind behaves. Seen near Earth, the solar wind plasma appears to be a relatively uniform flow—one that can interact with our planet’s natural magnetic field and cause space weather effects that interfere with technology. Instead of that flow, near the sun, Parker’s observations reveal a dynamic and highly structured system.
For the first time, scientists are able to study the solar wind from its source, the corona, similar to how one might observe the stream that serves as the source of a river. This provides a much different perspective as compared to studying the solar wind were its flow impacts Earth.
“By the time it gets to Earth, the solar wind is relatively smooth and well behaved, but close to the sun, it appears to be much more dynamic,” says coauthor Kristopher Klein, an assistant professor in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. “These local measurements of the solar wind represent the first steps into the region where the solar wind is still quite choppy and hasn’t been smoothed out yet.”
The spacecraft revealed that the sun’s rotation affects the solar wind much farther away than previously thought. Researchers knew that close in, the sun’s magnetic field pulls the wind in the same direction as the star’s rotation. Farther from the sun, at the distance the spacecraft measured in these first encounters, they had expected to see, at most, a weak signature of that rotation.
“To our great surprise, as we neared the sun, we’ve already detected large rotational flows—10 to 20 times greater than what standard models of the sun predict,” Kasper says. “So we are missing something fundamental about the sun, and how the solar wind escapes.
“This has huge implications. Space weather forecasting will need to account for these flows if we are going to be able to predict whether a coronal mass ejection will strike Earth, or astronauts heading to the moon or Mars,” Kasper says.
Parker Solar Probe’s findings regarding the sun’s magnetic field—which is believed to play a role in the coronal heating mystery—were equally surprising. From Earth’s vantage point, researchers detected magnetic oscillations called “Alfvén waves” in the solar wind long ago. Some researchers thought they may be remnants of whatever mechanism caused the heating phenomenon.
Parker researchers were on the lookout for indications that might be the case, but found something unexpected.
“When you get closer to the sun, you start seeing these ‘rogue’ Alfvén waves that have four times the energy than the regular waves around them,” Kasper says. “They feature 300,000 mph velocity spikes that are so strong, they actually flip the direction of the magnetic field.”
Those polarity-reversing velocity spikes offer another potential candidate for what may cause the corona to get hotter moving away from the sun.
“All of this new information from Parker Solar Probe will cause a fundamental rethinking of how the magnetic field of the sun behaves and is coupled to the acceleration of the solar wind,” says Lennard Fisk, professor of climate and space sciences and engineering.
“This is the closest we have ever observed a coronal-mass-ejection related energetic particle event,”  and member of the ISʘIS instrument team. “Parker was about 50 solar radii from the sun at the time.
“We are observing the sun’s outer atmosphere where we never have before,” says Joe Giacalone, a professor at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “This is exciting. Much of what we have seen was not expected. These initial observations still require some interpretation, which will help us better understand how the sun—and, by extension, other stars—work.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA says core stage of next Moon rocket now ready</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington (AFP) - NASA has completed the giant rocket that will take US astronauts back to the Moon, the space agency's head announced Monday, pledging the mission would take place in 2024 despite being beset by delays.
Towering 212 feet (65 meters), the equivalent of a 20-story building,
The Space Launch System (SLS) is the tallest rocket ever built at a towering 212 feet (65 meters), the equivalent of a 20-story building.
It is also the most powerful, designed to reach a record-breaking speed of Mach 23 before separating from its upper stage, the Orion crew capsule.
But its development has been hit by delays and cost overruns -- its first flight was set to take place in November 2018, and its price tag has risen from $6.2 billion to $8 billion, or 29 percent, according to a June audit report.
Standing before the orange behemoth at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine called it a "very important day" for the space agency "when we get to announce core stage complete for in fact the SLS rocket.
"We are making significant progress towards achieving that Artemis 3 mission and getting our first woman, and next man to the south pole of the Moon in 2024."
The Artemis 1 mission will likely take off by June 2020, according to the audit report. The first test will be uncrewed.
NASA plans to land on the Moon's south pole in order to exploit its water ice, discovered in 2009, both for life support purposes and to split into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket propellant.
The agency views its return to the Moon as a proving ground for an onward mission to Mars in the 2030s.
It's not just the cost of the rocket that has spiralled: NASA will have spent roughly $34 billion on the SLS, Orion, and Exploration Ground Systems Program programs through 2019, a sum projected to increase to over $50 billion by 2024.
The future of the mission rests on continued political support, both from the White House and Congress, which is ultimately responsible for budget allocations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Made In Space Europe wins LSA contract to develop inexpensive robotic arm</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAN FRANCISCO – Made In Space Europe won a Luxembourg Space Agency (LSA) contract to develop an inexpensive robotic arm for space applications, Made In Space Europe announced Dec. 9.
Made In Space Europe, part of LSA’s LuxImpulse program, will develop the first robotic arm designed specifically for low-cost space mission, under a contract managed by the European Space Agency (ESA), Jason Dunn, founder of Made In Space and Made In Space Europe, told SpaceNews by email. “This contract shows that ESA and LSA are committed to working with companies that are developing disruptive innovations that will dramatically reduce the barriers to entry for future space missions.”
Made In Space Europe declined to reveal the value of the contract.
“Historically, robotic arms designed for the space environment have been developed under large government contracts for single missions, resulting in high costs and continuously-extended development timelines,” said Dunn, who also serves as Made In Space Europe’s managing director. “Up until recently, with a current influx of robotics-dependent missions being planned and funded, the traditional method of developing one-off robotic arms met the market demand.”
Now that many more companies are planning space missions like satellite servicing and lunar surface operations, Made In Space Europe sees a market for a low-cost, scalable robotic arm.
“Made In Space Europe’s goal is to deliver an off-the-shelf robotic arm product to the commercial aerospace market that is easily-adapted for a variety of missions on short timelines and at a low cost,” Dunn said.
A demonstration mission for the robotic arm could occur as early as 2021, according to a Made In Space Europe news release.
“Our goal is to validate the product as efficiently as possible, while raising the technology readiness level in time for our early customers to use the robotic arm on their missions,” Dun said. “At this point we are still finalizing the details of initial demonstration missions with our customers.”
Demonstrations could occur on the International Space Station, a free-flying satellite or on the lunar surface, Dunn said.
In the United States, Made In Space is best known for sending 3D printers to the International Space Station. Made In Space Europe is focused on robotics and building off-Earth robotic capabilities for space industrialization. The ten-person company was founded in Luxembourg in early 2019. In the next year, the staff is likely to double, Dunn said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Storing data in everyday objects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Life's assembly and operating instructions are in the form of DNA. That's not the case with inanimate objects: anyone wishing to 3-D print an object also requires a set of instructions. If they then choose to print that same object again years later, they need access to the original digital information. The object itself does not store the printing instructions.
Researchers at ETH Zurich have now collaborated with an Israeli scientist to develop a means of storing extensive information in almost any object. "With this method, we can integrate 3-D-printing instructions into an object so that after decades, or even centuries, it will be possible to obtain those instructions directly from the object itself," explains Robert Grass, Professor at the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences.
Several developments of the past few years have made this advance possible. One of them is Grass' method for marking products with a DNA "barcode" embedded in miniscule glass beads. These nanobeads are used in industry as tracers for geological tests or as markers for high-quality food products, thus distinguishing them from counterfeits using a relatively short barcode consisting of a 100-bit code. This technology has now been commercialized by ETH spin-off Haelixa.
It has become possible to store enormous data volumes in DNA. Grass's colleague Yaniv Erlich, an Israeli computer scientist, developed a method that theoretically makes it possible to store 215,000 terabytes of data in a single gram of DNA. And Grass himself was able to store an entire music album in DNA—the equivalent of 15 megabytes of data.
The two scientists have now wedded these methods into a new form of data storage, as they report in the journal Nature Biotechnology. They call the storage form DNA of Things, a takeoff on the so-called Internet of Things, in which objects are connected with information via the internet.
Comparable to biology
As a use case, the researchers 3-D printed a rabbit out of plastic that contains the instructions (about 100 kilobytes' worth of data) for printing the object. The researchers achieved this by adding tiny glass beads containing DNA to the plastic. "Just like real rabbits, our rabbit also carries its own blueprint," Grass says.
And just like in biology, this new technological method retains the information over several generations—a feature the scientists demonstrated by retrieving the printing instructions from a small part of the rabbit and using them to print a whole new one. They were able to repeat this process five times, essentially creating the "great-great-great-grandchild" of the original rabbit.
"All other known forms of storage have a fixed geometry: A hard drive has to look like a hard drive, a CD like a CD. You can't change the form without losing information," Erlich says. "DNA is currently the only data storage medium that can also exist as a liquid, which allows us to insert it into objects of any shape."
Hiding information
A further application of the technology would be to conceal information in everyday objects, a technique experts refer to as steganography. To showcase this application, the scientists turned to history: Among the scant documents that attest to life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II is a secret archive that was assembled by a Jewish historian and ghetto resident at that time and hidden from Hitler's troops in milk cans. Today, this archive is listed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.
Grass, Erlich and their colleagues used the technology to store a short film about this archive (1.4 megabytes) in glass beads, which they then poured into the lenses of ordinary glasses. "It would be no problem to take a pair of glasses like this through airport security and thus transport information from one place to another undetected," Erlich says. In theory, it should be possible to hide the glass beads in any plastic objects that do not reach too high a temperature during the manufacturing process. Such plastics include epoxides, polyester, polyurethane and silicone.
Marking medications and construction materials
Furthermore, this technology could be used to mark medications or construction materials such as adhesives or paints. Information about their quality could be stored directly in the medication or material itself, Grass explains. This means medical supervisory authorities could read test results from production quality control directly from the product. And in buildings, for example, workers doing renovations can find out which products from which manufacturers were used in the original structure.
At the moment, the method is still relatively expensive. Translating a 3-D-printing file like the one stored in the plastic rabbit's DNA costs around 2,000 Swiss francs, Grass says. A large sum of that goes towards synthesizing the corresponding DNA molecules. However, the larger the batch size of objects, the lower the unit cost.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Writings on the Wall: Sharing Accessible Narratives Through Environmental Design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.
The original Dead Space is praised for its use of environmental design as a means to deliver compelling narratives to players. One such moment can be found within the opening act of the game when the player is aboard the derelict mining spaceship the USG Ishimura. The player approaches a dimly-lit room. It is covered with blood and guts; the iconic phrase “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” is smeared across the wall. As a western audience, we generally get the gist of this phrase. It is a call to action!
However, let’s examine this scene in isolation from the rest of the game.
How would someone who is dyslexic interpret this scene? They may have a hard time reading the phrase. Or, someone like my mom may have difficulty with comprehension because English is not her first language. There may be opportunities where a person would probably glance at these words and walk away because they are unable to interpret the meaning. It can come to a cost in the game’s experience because they are missing an important piece of narrative and the introduction to a gameplay tutorial.
Traditional methods to create narratives such as fully rendered cutscenes are commonly used in the industry. But, they often pull players away from the game’s experience or may not be a viable solution for many developers, particularly indies. Tools such as localization exist but they are often costly to develop and may not reach everyone.
In general, making narratives accessible to different types of people is hard.
But, designers can leverage a powerful tool at their disposal. The Environment! Players interact with the virtual spaces all the time; they are perfect opportunities to interweave pieces of narrative.
Let’s look at four different ways that designers have used the environment to create accessible narratives:
Environmental set pieces can be used by designers to share complex themes or narrative beats to the player.
The Ominous Face Etched On the Mountain
Early in the game, the player’s goal is to spread the ashes of Atreus’s mother on the highest mountain in Midgard. On-route to the summit, the player sees a human face etched on the mountain-side with black smoke coming from its mouth.
The human face is set up as a sort of “visual omen” or signifier of death. The vista warns travelers that the mountain is dangerous or cursed.
Thamur’s Corpse
The corpse of Thamur in Midgard is rich in environmental storytelling. While exploring this area, the player will learn more about how the giant lived, its culture, etc. Most of this information can be found from a closer examination of the giant's corpse by looking at its tattoos, clothing and jewelry. As players progress through the level, they can start to form a clear picture of who Thamur was before he died. This can all be achieved without the use of dialogue or cutscenes!
Visual symbolism can be used to communicate events and the passage of time.
Jötnar Shrines are triptychs (three carved wooden panels) that share stories of the Giants. These shrines are scattered throughout the game and often reveal notable events of the past or prophecies of the future.
Jörmungandr’s Jötnar Shrine - The World Serpent’s Shrine
The shrines can be seen as a sort of “picture book” to players. If we take a closer look at the images depicted on the shrine, then pieces of a narrative start to form. Looking at Jörmungandr’s Jötnar Shrine, a player can start to ask themselves questions.
Who is that woman? Is there a connection between the World Serpent and the Temple? Why is the World Serpent fighting Thor?
Triptychs are a super accessible format to share stories. They use visual imagery and symbolism to share narratives that are not bound by language for the player to interpret its meaning.
Detective work allows players to actively piece together a narrative from an arrangement of props within an environment.
The Collapsed Tunnel
The Last of Us does an excellent job of presenting environments that make players curious to know what happened in the past. Let's look at the Collapsed Tunnel scene for instance. There is a truck blocking a section of a tunnel from a horde of clickers. This simple composition of environmental props makes players ask questions.
How did this happen? Were they protecting themselves? Did the people survive?
Many “staged areas” like this one are scattered throughout the world of The Last of Us. These areas often invite players to take an active role in interpreting remnants of the past in order to determine a cause and effect.
The Quarantine Zone Settlement
Let’s look at another example, where the player is going through a Quarantine Zone and encounters a small settlement of survivors. At first, it seems that the survivor behind the food stand is cooking meat and selling it to others.
But, upon a closer examination, clues start to pop up. The player forms the conclusion that the survivor is serving rats as food! This simple arrangement of props imprints the struggle that these survivors are going through in the player's mind.
Environmental hints often provide insight into how the world of The Last of Us operates, the struggles that people go through, and to what lengths they go to in order to survive.
Lighting is an excellent tool for setting a certain mood or tone, which can lend itself to how a player should feel in the moment.
Looking at Playdead’s Inside, lighting is not only a tool used to guide players through levels, but it plays a strong role in communicating an abstract narrative.
Cool Artificial Lights that are emitted from flashlights or electronics force players to stay in the shadows. It often creates a sense of uneasiness. This lighting composition feeds into the player's primal response to fear the unknown.
Warm Natural Lighting provides a sense of comfort. It motivates players to move away from the shadows. It often foreshadows that a positive event will occur, whether it be solving a puzzle or escaping from an existential threat!
Making narratives accessible is super hard! There is no one size fits all solution to create stories that can be interpreted by different types of people. However, designers can leverage the worlds they create and continue to push the need to interweave pieces of environmental storytelling.
Environmental storytelling is such a powerful tool because designers can create narratives that are not bound to the banter between two characters or an expositional dump from a cutscene. It can often transcend the traditional forms we communicate as people through language. It allows players to take an active role to be apart of the fantasy the game world creates.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Light winds will continue through the first half of the week as a front stalls and diminishes near Kauai.
Outside of a few clouds and showers setting up over interior areas each afternoon due to sea breezes, mostly dry and stable conditions are anticipated.
Increasing moisture associated with another front that is forecast to move into the area will bring increasing rainfall chances and the potential for gusty northeast winds by the end of the week.
A new northwest swell now spreading into the area is forecast to product surf above the advisory threshold along north- and west-facing shores. As this swell subsides on Wednesday, a new very large northwest swell is expected.
Surf from that swell will produce surf well above warning levels along north- and west-facing shores of the smaller islands.
The swell is expected to gradually subside through Friday night.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Rare ‘Full Cold Moon Kiss’ Is Coming This Week—Here’s How to See It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Every year ends with a cold moon—the name given to a full moon that appears in December. The full cold moon that's lighting up skies in 2019 will come with a bonus spectacle for sky-gazers. As Forbes reports, a planetary "kiss" between Saturn and Venus will coincide with the last full moon of the year. Here's what you need to know about the astronomical events.
The full moon of each month has a unique nickname associated with the time of year it occurs. A cold moon happens as temperatures drop and winter settles in, hence the name. December's full moon has also been called the long nights moon by some Native American tribes and the moon Before Yule in Europe, according to Travel and Leisure.
This year's moon will be visible the night of December 11 through the morning of December 12. On this same night, the planets Venus and Saturn will appear closer than usual in the night sky. The celestial bodies will be less than 2° apart and share a celestial longitude, a phenomena known as a conjunction or a planetary "kiss."
During twilight on Tuesday, December 10, the bright planet Venus and the dimmer planet Saturn will arrive at their closest conjunction, 1.8° apart, above the southwestern horizon. The following evening, they'll be just .01° further away. Stick around the night of Wednesday, December 11 to catch the full cold moon, which reaches peak illumination at 9:12 p.m. on the West Coast and at 12 minutes after midnight on the East Coast.
Not planning on staying up late to see the moon reach its fullest state? Moonrise on December 11 will be just as spectacular. When the moon surfaces around sunset, it will appear larger and more reddish in color in the sky. Meanwhile, Venus's and Saturn's kiss will be visible 180º away.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Archaeologists discover 'amazing' 4,000 year old carved stones on Orkney</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Archaeologists have discovered nine 'very rare' carved stones on Orkney - thought to be 4,000 years old.
The dig, at an electrical substation in Finstown, unearthed the "amazing" series of 50cm tall stone-carved objects while completing exploratory excavations.
A team from ORCA Archaeology had to dig through 60cm of midden deposits to uncover the ancient artifacts.
The sculptures appear to have all been worked to give them shoulders, a neck and what looks like a head.
They were scattered around a hearth within the remains of structure containing three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones.
Three of the roughly carved figures were incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones.
It is believed they may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.
But the purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site 4,000 years ago is still a mystery.

Dating the necked stones will require further work since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney.
On initial evidence, it is believed the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly 2000BC.
Experts are trying to identify the purpose of these stones - and if they are figurines - with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks.
Professor Colin Richards from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute said: "This is a significant discovery in Orkney and probably within North West Europe.
"It is very rare to find representations of people in prehistoric Orkney and when found, they are usually individual or in very small groups.
"If they are figurines, to find nine figures within one structure is very exciting and together with the archaeology found at this site has the potential to add to our understanding of Orcadian society in prehistory."
In one of the trenches, long marks were found cut into the clay subsoil, which were made by ards - stone ploughs- providing evidence for prehistoric farming in Orkney.
The prehistoric ploughs were made from wood with a stone shaped into a rough point placed into the wood to plough the soil ready for planting.
It is believed that the survival of these marks, together with the remnants of the Early Neolithic and Bronze Age settlement structures, offers an insight into the prehistoric use of the site over 2,000 years ago.
This included people living, farming and burying their dead across the hillside land.

Pete Higgins, ORCA Archaeology project manager, said: "This collaborative project with SSEN gives us the opportunity to examine an important prehistoric site that would otherwise not have been excavated.
"The exploratory trenches are now recorded and covered over, while the significant artefacts are now cleaned and stored for future study.
"Discussions will take place on the next steps for the development."
Simon Hall, SSEN Environmental project manager, said: "We have been working closely with ORCA Archaeology for the past 18 months while they have undertaken archaeological work at our substation site near Finstown.
"We are delighted that the team have been able to make such a significant find at the site, hopefully furthering the understanding of Orkney's rich heritage.
"We will continue to work closely with ORCA Archaeology and all relevant bodies to ensure this find is appropriately managed for the people of Orkney."

EQC funds $1 million of research to reduce natural disaster risk
EQC has announced $1 million of funding for 16 research projects to help reduce the impact of natural hazards on New Zealanders’ homes, towns and cities.
Winners of the 2020 EQC Biennial Awards will be looking at everything from new ways to detect signs of eruption in volcanoes, testing new building materials, investigating a newly discovered fault on the Hauraki Plains, to developing low-cost early earthquake warning sensor networks.
Dr Jo Horrocks, Head of Resilience Strategy and Research, says the projects are part of EQC’s annual $17 million of research funding aimed at reducing the impact of natural disasters on people and property.
“New Zealand is a risky country from a natural hazards point of view. Our research programme is focused on understanding more about New Zealand’s natural hazards, and working out how to reduce the impact on New Zealanders.
“We can’t stop earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other hazards. But we can help minimise the impacts on communities and ensure that as a nation, we are prepared to not just survive, but thrive, through periods of disruption,” says Dr Horrocks.
The recipients, scientists at Auckland, Victoria, Massey and Canterbury universities, as well as GNS Science, BRANZ and Resilient Organisations are focused on three research areas: better understanding of geological hazards, creating better engineering and improving community resilience.
“EQC has a unique position as both an insurer and a science funder. This means we can identify essential research outcomes that can be used now, and also look at some of the big challenges for New Zealand that may take more than one generation of scientists to solve,” says Dr Horrocks.
“EQC has invested in hundreds of research projects over many years to support scientific understanding of natural hazards so we can mitigate risk. The results have led to new building techniques and better building codes, identifying at-risk land, and detailed information for planners and emergency managers about the likely effects of natural hazards in their region,” she says.
“When homeowners are paying their EQC levy, as well as getting natural disaster insurance, they are making a contribution to research that helps us understand the likelihood and impact of natural hazards, and what steps can be taken to reduce the impact on New Zealanders.”
Dr Horrocks says that along with funding the Biennial Grants, EQC also contributes $13 million to the GeoNet natural hazard monitoring system, funds research at universities and supports regional organisations like Determining Volcanic Risk in Auckland and It’s Our Fault in Wellington that bring together natural hazard research with local government decision-makers and emergency managers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bio-Protection Research Centre scientists and collaborators have made a discovery that potentially opens the door to new medicines and biological pesticides.
In work that began with a PhD thesis, and continued through postdoctoral work, they have shown that scientists have been missing potential new drugs and biopesticides, dismissing the genes that make them as non-functional variants.
“This is a fundamental discovery,” says Prof Barry Scott, who is based at Massey University. Prof Scott mentored Daniel Berry, the scientist who started investigating the “junk genes” as part of his PhD research in 2012.
Now Dr Berry is the lead author on the paper outlining the discovery, which has just been published in the highly prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr Berry’s discovery involves a group of “modular enzymes”, which naturally occur in fungi. Modular enzymes are molecular assembly lines that make bioactive substances, which scientists have harnessed to work as medicines, or as natural pesticides or growth enhancers in agriculture and horticulture.
The antibiotic penicillin is perhaps the best-known product of a modular enzyme.
In 2012, while researching for his PhD thesis, Dr Berry was investigating synthesis of peramine, a natural pasture pest-repellent made by a modular enzyme of the fungus Epichloë.
“A lot of the genes had been mucked up and didn’t make peramine,” says Prof Scott. “But one of those gene variants kept occurring, so although it looked like it wasn’t functioning, Daniel realised it had to serve some purpose, and decided to investigate.”
Prof Scott said for some time their investigations led nowhere. “That’s often the nature of science – it can take a long time.”
The breakthrough came when Daniel went to Germany to work with Dr Helge Bode, an expert in modular enzymes. With Dr Bode’s help, he discovered the modular enzyme from the variant gene produced a product they named cycloProArg, which is likely to be bioactive.
“It was an exciting day when we were finally able to identify what this gene was making,” says Dr Berry. “This discovery really opened the door for us, as it enabled identification of an additional three products that are made by other variants of this gene.”
“We don’t yet know precisely what cycloProArg does – that will be the subject of further research,” says Prof Scott. “But we know that as well as providing protection from pests, Epichloë promotes pasture growth and has lots of other beneficial effects. CycloProArg is probably responsible for one of those benefits.”
The real breakthrough, he says, is the discovery that modular enzymes make more than one bioactive product.
“Previously we thought one enzyme, one product,” says Prof Scott. “But we now know this is wrong.
“This fundamentally changes what we know, and what we should be looking for.
“Scientists in many fields – including medicine – should go back and take a look at previously discarded ‘junk genes’, because some of these may actually produce useful bioactive products.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to NASA’s Asteroid Fast Facts page, a lot of space material lands on Earth every year. From the NASA page:
“Every day, Earth is bombarded with more than 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles.
“About once a year, an automobile-sized asteroid hits Earth's atmosphere, creates an impressive fireball, and burns up before reaching the surface.
Every 2,000 years or so, a meteoroid the size of a football field hits Earth and causes significant damage to the area.”
When is the next one coming? No one knows. But NASA and other organizations worldwide constantly watch out for possible impactors from space. Even so, some escape discovery until they hit. In 2013, a small asteroid, about the size of a six-story building, entered our atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russian. It exploded with a blast more powerful than the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. The blast shattered glass in buildings all over the city and caused injuries to more than 1,200 people. It was so bright that scientists estimate it briefly outshone the sun. We had no warning of this event. No one saw it coming.
Many telescopes automatically search the night sky for incoming asteroids, for one with Earth in its sights. But scientists need your help finding them. You may be the one to spot the next one that threatens Earth.
An organization called Zooniverse currently has 108 projects where anyone, even you, can help scientists make new discoveries. I have written about Zooniverse before, but they have added quite a few new projects since then and more are added every year. You can find them at www.zooniverse.org.
The project to help find potentially dangerous asteroid is at www.zooniverse.org/projects/sandorkruk/hubble-asteroid-hunter. As with all the Zooniverse projects, you get a brief tutorial on what to look for and how to identify a target. Then you are presented with a series of photos. Using what you learned in the tutorial, you identify potential asteroid targets. Once identified, the project scientists analyze the photo to calculate the asteroid’s path to determine if Earth is in the way.
If saving the Earth from asteroid impacts isn’t your cup of tea, look through all of their projects. It’s likely one or several of the others will pique your interest.
Meteor Shower
The Geminid meteor shower peaks on the night of Friday and Saturday. While it can produce as many as 100 meteors per hour, a bright moon only three days past full will block out all but the brightest.
If you happen to be spending Christmas in Indonesia, Southeast Asia or Australia this year, step outside in the early afternoon. The moon passes between us and the sun, creating a solar eclipse. The moon is farther than average from us and won’t quite cover the entire disk of the sun. A ring, or annulus, of sunlight will encircle the dark moon, creating a relatively rare annular eclipse.
We won’t see any of this eclipse in Oklahoma. The next eclipse we see any part of in our state occurs on Oct. 14, 2023. But mark April 8, 2024, on your calendar. A total solar eclipse passes over southeast Oklahoma on that day, the best eclipse to hit our state in living memory.
Planet Visibility Report
December begins with Mars and Mercury in the pre-dawn sky. Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are grouped fairly close together low in the evening twilight. Over the course of the month, Venus gets higher, while the other two sink into invisibility on the twilight. Mercury also dives into the sun’s morning twilight glare, and by month’s end, only Venus in the evening sky and Mars in the morning sky remain visible. Full moon occurs on the 11th with new moon following on Christmas day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vollebak designs jacket that lets the wearer sleep in space</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Experimental clothing brand Vollebak's Deep Sleep Cocoon jacket is designed to allow people to sleep anywhere, including in space.
The Deep Sleep Cocoon jacket has been designed by Vollebak so that people wearing it can sleep in the most difficult conditions. It was created specifically for space where sleeping can be difficult due to noise and light.
"The sleeping conditions we take for granted on Earth, like quiet and darkness, are far from guaranteed in space," explained Vollebak co-founder Steve Tidball.
"Astronauts on the International Space Station experience 16 sunrises a day, and 75 per cent of crew report using sleeping pills which induce sedation rather than deep sleep," he told Dezeen.
"This in turn impacts cognitive ability and alertness in space, where there's little room for error."
The jacket is designed to be "a microhabitat for a person", so that the wearer is not reliant on the environment they are in to fall sleep.
To allow the wearer to sleep, the coat has a large hood that resembles the visor on a space helmet and is made from five segments that can fold down and cover the wearer's entire face.
The soft hood is designed to hold its shape to create a cocoon that is kept clear of the wearer's face. It has a segmented structure that is similar to the body of a woodlouse.
"To solve this engineering challenge with a single piece of clothing we turned to nature and looked at structures that are highly adaptable, protective, and allow creatures to metamorphose from one state to the next," said the brand.
While the hooded section looks identical to the rest of the jacket it is constructed from a breathable, mesh fabric that wearers can see out of but people on the outside can't see through.
The rest of the coat is made from a three-layer fabric for warmth with a waterproof and windproof membrane. A two-way zipper means the wearer can decide how enclosed within the jacket they want to be.
Vollebak built the jacket for the first journeys to Mars, as their research showed that current sleeping conditions in outer space leaves a lot to be desired.
"Sleep in space today is not exactly a vision of the future," explained Tidball. "Alongside eye masks and earplugs every crew member has a cupboard-sized sleeping pod with a sleeping bag fixed to the wall with a bungee cord to combat microgravity and air currents."
Tidball believes that people's sleeping habits will have to adapt to the light conditions in space, and this may mean reverting to patterns of sleep found before the invention of electric lighting.
"Before the introduction of artificial light during the Industrial Revolution, sleeping several times a day was common," explained Tidball.
"Many nomadic and hunter gatherer societies still sleep on and off during day and night, and under experimental conditions people sleep and wake more frequently," he continued.
"So the Deep Sleep Cocoon is built for shift-pattern sleeping that we may well revert back to as we travel further and further into space – by allowing the clothes you're in to double as your sleeping bag."
Vollebak predict that as humans travel further into space the clothes that they wear will have to be become more useful.
"As something that's always attached to us, clothing is uniquely suited to solve some of the simplest as well as most complex questions that will arise as we go intergalactic," said Tidball.
"It will become our breathing system, our doctor, sleep aid, source of comfort, food and hydration. In an environment like space where every gram and every square millimetre increases the cost of the mission, clothing will have to start to do more."
Clothing company Vollebak was established by twin brothers Steve and Nick Tidball in 2015. The company has launched numerous experimental items of clothing including the first jacket made of graphene, which acts as a radiator.
It has also released a T-shirt made entirely from wood pulp and algae and a jacket that reflects light from two billion glass spheres. Vollebak also made a coat for early man called the 50,000 BC jacket.
"Creating clothing for the first journeys to Mars and clothing for early man's colonisation of Earth are equally fascinating engineering challenges," said Tidball.
"Over the past 50,000 years clothes have helped us maintain stasis – keeping us warm, dry, cool, or conferring status. Over the next 50,000 years clothes will help enhance everything from strength, to health, to sensory perception. It's simply a question of what timescale that happens on."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Exeter Uni 'at the forefront' of research into likes of dementia and schizophrenia with new equipment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new, state-of-the-art genome sequencing platform will put Exeter on the cutting edge of research into the genomic basis of health and disease.
The Illumina NovaSeq sequencer has just been installed at the University of Exeter, part-funded by over £600,000 from the Wellcome Trust .
The investment represents a significant upgrade to Exeter’s ability to sequence whole genomes faster and in much greater depth than before.
The award has also enabled Exeter to invest in technology for profiling the way genes are expressed – or “switched on” - in individual cells. It will enable researchers to explore the molecular pathology of disease in complex tissues such as the brain.
The new equipment is a significant boost to Exeter’s research capabilities in efforts to find underlying causes and new treatments in key disease areas, including diabetes, obesity, dementia and schizophrenia as well as providing a hugely flexible platform for all genomics-inspired biology and medicine.
Professor Jonathan Mill, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the bid said: “This new equipment provides biomedical researchers in Exeter with amazing new opportunities for genomic research and puts us at the forefront of the field.
"We will be able to sequence entire genomes quickly and efficiently. I’m particularly excited about the opportunity to assess gene expression in individual cells in conditions like schizophrenia and dementia.”
If working at maximum capacity, the new machine could sequence up to 300 human genomes per week, dramatically increasing the ability to identify genetic variants associated with health and disease.
The latest investment is in addition to a new machine funded with £30,000 from Alzheimer’s Research UK, which will be used to measure key epigenetic changes in dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.
The new equipment will be operated by the University of Exeter Sequencing Service, headed by Dr Aaron Jeffries.
He said: “The Illumina NovaSeq adds to the repertoire of cutting-edge genomics facilities in Exeter. We are now one of the best-equipped centres for genetics research in the UK, with state-of-the-art sequencing technology, robotics and high-performance computing. ”
Professor Neil Gow, Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research and Impact) at the University of Exeter, said: “These combined investments are incredibly exciting for Exeter as they vastly expand our genomic inspired research capabilities.
"We’re also really looking forward to the Mireille Gillings Neuroimaging Centre coming launching in the new year, that will mean we can generate images of the body’s organs in far greater detail.
"These new and exciting technology platforms will accelerate both fundamental and applied research in key areas of human disease and eventually to the delivery of life-enhancing benefits for patients.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nvidia researchers present a rendering framework that can produce 3D objects from 2D images</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nvidia researchers have created a rendering framework that uses AI to take 2D information and transform it into a 3D object accurately. The system is called DIB-R, short for differentiable interpolation-based renderer and is built on PyTorch, a machine learning framework. The team will be presenting its findings at the annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in Vancouver, Washington, this week.
Essentially the framework does the opposite of what GPUs usually do. It analyzes an image and then forms a high-fidelity 3D object, including shape, texture, color, and lighting. The encoder-decoder architecture starts with a polygonal sphere and morphs it using the given information in the 2D image.
The process only takes one-tenth of a second, but the neural network takes two days to train using a single Nvidia V100 GPU. Nvidia claims that training using other GPUs would take several weeks. After feeding it several datasets containing pictures of birds, DIB-R was able to accurately create 3D models when given a single image.
While birds were the focus of the experiment, co-author of the research paper on the subject, Jun Gao said that the system can render any 2D image into a 3D model.
“This is essentially the first time ever that you can take just about any 2D image and predict relevant 3D properties,” said Gao.
The researchers believe that the system can be used to give depth perception to autonomous robots improving safety and accuracy when working in an environment. Being able to understand the three-dimensionality of things around it will allow robots to better navigate as well as manipulate the objects they are tasked with handling.
Nvidia has added DIB-R to Kaolin, its 3D deep learning PyTorch GitHub library. Kaolin helps researchers accelerate 3D deep learning experiments.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On December 5th, SpaceX pulled off a flawless Falcon 9 booster debut in support of the Cargo Dragon spacecraft’s CRS-19 space station resupply mission, marking the first launch of a new booster in months.
More specifically, the last time SpaceX launched a new Falcon 9 booster was on June 25th, 2019 during STP-2, Falcon Heavy Block 5’s second mission in two months. The mission featured two flight-proven side boosters – both reused from the Block 5 rocket’s April 11th launch debut – but also relied on a new center core (B1057). B1057 unfortunately failed moments before a planned touchdown on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) but still technically qualifies as the last new booster launched by SpaceX prior to CRS-19.
A few days shy of six months later, CRS-19’s brand new Falcon 9 booster (and an expendable upper stage) rolled out to SpaceX’s LC-40 launch pad, confirming suspicions that the mission would use a new booster instead of twice-flown B1056.
After the booster successfully launched CRS-17 and CRS-18 in May and July 2019, both SpaceX and NASA indicated that B1056 was the most likely candidate to launch CRS-19. Plans clearly changed, although SpaceX indicated in a prelaunch conference that the booster manifest swap was purely a scheduling move and didn’t indicate any technical issues or dissatisfaction from NASA.
In the history of SpaceX booster reuse, NASA has thus far only been comfortable flying on flight-proven boosters that had previously flown NASA missions only, meaning that it will likely be at least 12-18 months before the space agency has another twice-flown Falcon 9 booster ready for a NASA mission. Regardless, the space agency has been undeniably willing to support the technology far sooner than most would have expected, given its history of extreme conservatism over the two or so decades.
Regardless, after a brief wind-related 24-hour delay, Falcon 9 B1059 lifted off for the first time on December 5th, performing perfectly and ultimately landing on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) to leave the upper stage with enough fuel to perform experiments after deploying Cargo Dragon. The mission’s drone ship landing – unusual for Cargo Dragon launches – raised suspicions in the spaceflight community and SpaceX ultimately confirmed the above information, indicating that CRS-19’s upper stage would perform orbital coast tests (likely for the USAF).
As it turns out Falcon 9 B1059’s flawless landing aboard OCISLY also made it the 20th booster SpaceX has successfully recovered. All told, SpaceX has flown a total of 46 separate missions with flight-proven Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, all of which have occurred since the technology’s March 2017 debut.
After reaching orbit for the third time ever, Cargo Dragon capsule C106 and a fresh trunk began the journey to the International Space Station (ISS) with around 2600 kg (5800 lb) of science experiments, consumables, and other cargo aboard. The spacecraft successful rendezvoused with the ISS on December 8th and was captured and berthed by the station’s massive robotic arm (Canadarm2) shortly thereafter. All told, SpaceX has now delivered roughly 41 metric tons (90,000 lb) of cargo for NASA over its 19 successful missions to the ISS.
Meanwhile, with its first launch and landing – and a relatively gentle one, at that – under its belt, Falcon 9 B1059 should theoretically be a prime candidate for rapid turnaround, although there’s a good chance that SpaceX will hold the booster to support CRS-20, Cargo Dragon 1’s last planned launch. That mission is expected no earlier than March 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NVIDIA Is Using Machine Learning To Transform 2D Images Into 3D Models</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers at NVIDIA have come up with a clever machine learning technique for taking 2D images and fleshing them out into 3D models. Normally this happens in reverse—these days, it's not all that difficult to take a 3D model and flatten it into a 2D image. But to create a 3D model without feeding a system 3D data is far more challenging."In traditional computer graphics, a pipeline renders a 3D model to a 2D screen. But there’s information to be gained from doing the opposite—a model that could infer a 3D object from a 2D image would be able to perform better object tracking, for example.," NVIDIA explains.What the researchers came up with is a rendering framework called DIB-R, which stands for differentiable interpolation-based renderer. The goal was to design a framework that could accomplish this task while integrating seamlessly with machine learning techniques."The result, DIB-R, produces high-fidelity rendering by using an encoder-decoder architecture, a type of neural network that transforms input into a feature map or vector that is used to predict specific information such as shape, color, texture and lighting of an image," NVIDIA says.According to NVIDIA, this type of thing could be especially helpful in robotics. By processing 2D images into 3D models, an autonomous robot would be in a better position to interact with its environment more safely and efficiently, as it could "sense and understand it surroundings" using this technology.NVIDIA says it takes two days to train this kind of model on a single Tesla V100 Tensor Core GPU, versus several weeks to train the same kind of thing without its GPUs. What that ultimately translates to is being able to produce a 3D object from a 2D image in less than 100 milliseconds.Researchers at NVIDIA trained their model on a bunch of datasets, including a set collection of bird images. Once trained, a system could look at a 2D image of a bird and a produce a 3D model with the right shape and texture."This is essentially the first time ever that you can take just about any 2D image and predict relevant 3D properties," says Jun Gao, one of a team of researchers who collaborated on DIB-R.Beyond robotics, NVIDIA also sees this as being handy in transforming 2D images of dinosaurs and other extinct animals, into lifelike 3D images in quick fashion (under a second).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mars has often been thought of as a plan B planet with entrepreneurs like Elon Musk making ambitious plans to colonize the Red Planet. NASA has even flirted with the idea, releasing a strategy for human exploration and colonization of Mars in 2015.
RELATED: NASA TO FUND AUTONOMOUS SPACE HABITATS ON THE MOON AND MARS
However, there's been no proof that the celestial body could actually sustain life. Now, according to Amazon Prime’s Tomorrow’s World, a scientist has replicated Mars' conditions in a chamber to test whether life could indeed survive on the planet.
What he found was that life not only survived, it thrived. Dr. Jean-Pierre Paul De Vera, of the German Spatial Research Centre in Berlin, created what is called a "Martian chamber" to test the living conditions on the Red Planet.
In this amazing invention, the "temperature, atmospheric pressure, chemical composition, UV rays," and more of Mars were recreated and regulated with precision to match the planet's real conditions.
In 2012, DeVera began by testing how long cyanobacteria could survive in the chamber. He found that the phylum lasted several weeks with no complications.
He then extended his experimentation to using microorganisms from Antarctica. These organisms also thrived in the Martian chamber.
“From what we’ve seen, the results we’ve had, it would be possible to find life there, or terrestrial life, microorganisms could survive on Mars," said De Vera in Amazon's show.
“It’s impressive, we never imagined these results, especially with more complex organisms. They are not bacteria, they’re organisms, which use photosynthesis. Life is possible on Mars, and Mars can be a habitat for organisms that live on Earth," he added.
Although this is promising news for humanity, it must be noted that actually getting to Mars and then making the planet livable is well beyond our reach at the moment. As such, it is best not to count on plans B and work our hardest to save the planet we are on right now.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Are you a thrill-seeker who loves water slides? Then you might want to consider checking out some of these crazy water slides from around the world. 
2020 might just be the year for you to book yourself on a world-water slide tour? Or not. 
RELATED: 12 OF THE MOST THRILLING WATER SLIDES AROUND THE WORLD
While the vast majority of water slides in the world are perfectly safe, there are some very notorious ones that have since been closed. One famous example was the Black Hole water ride at the Wet 'n Wild Water Park in Orlando. 
While it did enjoy many years of happy customers, back in 2000 one rider was so badly injured that he sought, and won, a $1.73 million court case. But this was far from the only incident on the slide. 
The ride was plagued with issues like tubes constantly flipping over, people falling off the rise and tubes often hitting other tubes. What's more most of these incidents occurred in one of the ride's darker sections. 
At over 12-stories tall, Cyclon is one of the world's biggest water slides. This 200 meters long, 20-meter diameter slide recently opened in Aqualandia, Benidorm and is already a fond favorite for holidaymakers to the area. 
"Cyclon is a big attraction with extraordinary dimensions. The attraction counts 36 meters high and with 200 meters in length. You will find different falls, curves, and descents. You can enjoy a long route of 2.7 meters with afloat for 4 persons and you are going to arrive on a large “vortex” with 20 meters of diameter and 45 degrees inclination.The adventure in this big “vortex” ends with a fall in the pool." - Aqualandia. 
According to sites like The Gear Hunt, some of the best inflatable water slides around include, but are not limited to: -
So without further ado, here are some of the world's craziest water slides. For those who love water-based death-defying experiences, you might want to book a trip ASAP. 
The Mammoth Water Coaster at the Holiday World & Splashin' Safari in Indiana is one of the world's craziest water slides. This six-person water coaster covers no less than three acres of the safari park and runs for just under a third of a mile (0.5 km). 
The slide is powered by linear induction motors (LIMS). These motors are also used in traditional roller coasters and light rail transportation. 
It is because of these motors that the Mammoth water slide is so fast and can accommodate steep uphill and downhill sections. The water coaster is also a record-breaker, holding the record for the World's Longest Water Coaster.
The Shark Attack in Aquadventure Waterpark, Dubai is yet another of the world's craziest water slides. This amazing water slide's main feature is that riders travel underwater sailing through an aquarium teeming with sharks. 
For full effect, the tube is completely transparent bringing riders up close and personal, but safely, into the realm of the shark. While this may conjure up images of Jaws 3-D, rest assured the ride is completely safe.
Plus there are no giant homicidal Great White sharks to worry about. At least as far as we are aware!
Featuring an almost vertical loop-the-loop section, the El Abismo in Mexico is another of the world's craziest water slides. RIders of the water slide start the ride by standing on a trapdoor. 
The ride can be found 90 minutes southwest of Mexico City. 
Once they are first dropped, riders reach 60 kilometers per hour just prior to reaching the ride's crazy loop. The loop is also transparent adding to the thrill of the ride.
"With the unique slide path, we had to optimize the shape of the loop to maximize the range of riders that could use it while making sure no one got stuck," says Bruce Bradley, senior engineering specialist at WhiteWater West theme park designers.
The Tsunami Surge water slide at Hurricane Harbor, Six Flags Over Georgia, Atlanta is yet another of the world's craziest water slides. It is the world's first hybrid zero-gravity slide that features a five-story drop that transports riders into a whirlpool bowl that spins them 360-degrees. 
"[Get] ready to be sent down an enclosed tube into a 40-foot-wide bowl, where guests will feel a moment of zero-gravity, or weightlessness, before hitting an embankment and landing in the splash pool below. Throughout the whole water ride, you'll be screaming around every slippery turn." - Six Flags Over Georgia. 
The ride consumes around 300,000 gallons of water every hour. 
Kilimanjaro, Aldeia das Águas Park Resort, Brazil is one hell of a water ride. Named in honor of the famous Tanzanian mountain, this 49.9-meter tall water ride offers riders a 164-foot (50 meters) drop. 
It is officially the world's tallest water slide and riders quickly reach an incredible 100 km/h as they hurtle down the water slide. If you want to try it for yourself, it can be found at the Aldeia das Águas Park Resort, which is located around about 120 kilometers from the city of Rio de Janeiro.
The King Cobra at the Maxx Royal Belek Golf and Spa in Turkey is yet another of the world's craziest water slides. Riders travel along the slide at an incredible 51 km/h and are treated to a tour of a giant cobra's body before sliding up into its mouth. 
Many in the industry consider the slide something of a game-changer. 
"It's a high-capacity ride with two double tubes, and it's interactive because the passengers race each other... It has a strong visual impact and a unique spectator appeal, with integrated special effects, such as hissing sounds," says Sohret Pakis of Polin Waterparks & Pool Systems.
The Boeing 747 at Evergreen Wings and Waves Waterpark in Oregon is probably one of the most unique water slides in the world. As the name suggests, the ride actually features a real decommissioned Boeing 747 with four waterslides coming out of it. 
Riders get to choose which water slide adventure they want to take including their Sonic Boom slide. This slide lets riders experience the feeling of being catapulted out of the plane's fuselage.
The water park has many other interesting and fun rides and might be the perfect destination for any aircraft enthusiast.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Controversial World's First Monkey-Pig Hybrids Born in China</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a world-first, scientists in China created pig-primate chimeras. The two piglets looked like normal baby pigs but had primate cells, and they died within a week.
The point of the research is to ultimately grow human organs in animals for transplantation. This type of biology sparks controversial debates, and this most recent experiment shows that there is still a long way to go before this method of growing organs is achieved.
RELATED: SCIENTISTS DISCOVER NEW PAIN-DETECTING ORGAN JUST UNDER OUR SKIN
"This is the first report of full-term pig-monkey chimeras," said Tang Hai at the State Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Reproductive Biology in Beijing.
This development brings up ethical concerns but could prove useful for organ transplantation in the future. 
Hai and his team of scientists modified cynomolgus monkey cells and injected them into pig embryos five days after fertilization.
Over 4,000 embryos were implanted. From these thousands of embryos, 10 piglets were born, two of which were chimeras. All died within a week of being born. In the two chimeras, a number of tissues partly consisted of monkey cells.
For instance, the piglets' heart, liver, spleen, lung, and skin all showed a proportion, albeit low, of monkey cells.
Hai stated that the reason behind the piglets' death remains a mystery. However, given all 10 piglets died — chimeric and non-chimeric — he believes the reason may be because of IVF, and not the chimerism.
The team is now looking to create more piglets with a higher proportion of monkey cells.
This type of research is controversial, for instance, stem cell biologist Paul Knoepfler at the University of California, Davis said "Given the extremely low chimeric efficiency and the deaths of all the animals, I actually see this as fairly discouraging."
Knoepfler is one of many who doesn't believe this method of growing organs for transplantation within animals is a viable option. 
The study was published in Protein & Cell in November.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A team of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) has created a strong hydrogel that operates much like our own skin, ligaments, and bone. Incredibly, it can heal itself and change shape.
This invention has the potential to create a new style of medical implants or artificial muscles. 
Their findings were published in Advanced Materials in October.

Hydrogels are gels with high water content and are used in a number of different products, for instance, contact lenses and prosthetic limbs. 
This hydrogel, though, has dynamic chemical bonds that set it apart from any reported hydrogel to date, according to lead senior researcher of the study, Luke Connal from the ANU.
Connal said, "With the special chemistry we've engineered in the hydrogel, it can repair itself after it has been broken like human skin can."
"Hydrogels are usually weak, but our material is so strong it could easily lift very heavy objects and can change its shape like human muscles do. This makes our hydrogel suitable for artificial muscles in what we call soft robotics," he continued.
"Our hydrogel's ability to self-heal, as well as its flexibility and strength, make it an ideal material for wearable technology and various other biomedical devices." 
A rather impressive hydrogel. 
Dr. Zhen Jiang, co-researcher of the study and Postdoctoral Fellow at the ANU said the inspiration for the hydrogel came from his Ph.D. project. 
Jiang explained that a method of controlling temperature directs how the hydrogel is shaped, enabling it to move much like an artificial muscle.
"In a lot of science fiction movies, we see the most challenging jobs being done by artificial humanoid robots. Our research has made a significant step towards making this possible," he said.
Jiang continued, "We anticipate that researchers working on the next generation of soft robots will be interested and excited about our new way of making hydrogels."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who Exactly Invented Math?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mathematics is at the center of our modern world, whether we'd like to admit it or not. Behind our smartphones, our cars, our computers, even the weather, math is quietly working to calculate the past, present, and future. Math is a scientific principle that seems to predate even science itself.
When you stop and think about it though, who was the first person to use math? After all, we know famous inventors of specific equations, but what about for math as a concept? This doesn't seem like too far off of a proposition either given that modern realms of science have founders, like Max Planck, the father of quantum mechanics or Isaac Newton and calculus. So, who invented mathematics?
The origins of mathematics date back to early pre-historic times that were, well, prehistory. That means that we have no proof of the origins of the first use of mathematics, but we can infer. The first peoples on earth would've had to deal with principles of number, magnitude, and form on a daily basis. From deciding which berry to eat or which basic task accomplished the most work in the shortest amount of time. 
In a hunter-gatherer culture, you early humans also would've had to have dealt with the division of food evenly throughout the community. So there would've needed to have been some method of mathematical distribution.
As for actual evidence of these first practices, we have artifacts dating back 20,000 years in Africa that present some of the first conceptual theories of time. 
Geometry was one of the first subsets of mathematics that was likely formed as well. We have evidence dating to the fifth Millenium B.C. demonstrating Egyptian's knowledge of geometric principles.
For the early years of math, cultures existed largely siloed into their own communities and geographical areas. This meant that each region developed its own means of doing math that slowly evolved to reflect the core principles of the mathematical laws of nature.
Each roughly 6000 years ago can be traced through a lineage of discovering addition, multiplication, and division.
Mesopotamian and Egyptian societies likely made the largest advancements in early mathematics simply due to their age of existence and their overall size and resources.

More advanced mathematical methods started developing in Greece around 2,500 years ago. These are specific formulas and theorems like the work of Pythagoras or Euclid. 
Most experts in the realm of mathematics agree that around 2,500 years ago was the first time that humanity as a whole saw the foundation of organized science. This means that the world, roughly as one, started working together and sharing knowledge of math and science.
All of the previously siloed work that was being done throughout various other cultures in the millennia prior slowly started to be integrated into one joint collection of knowledge.
It was from this point onward that the question of "who invented math?" can be answered a little better. Not only do we have a firm history of the founders of modern mathematics, but there are also specific people to come up with specific formulas. 
The answer to the question of who invented math is, disappointingly, everyone and no one at the same time. If you'd like to learn about all of the different regions of mathetics. The video below lays them out fairly comprehensively. You'll note that there are so many subsets of mathematics it's hard to even grasp who the most prominent mathematicians in modern history are. Take a look.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hermit crabs are confusing plastic for shells and it's killing them</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than half a million hermit crabs have been killed after becoming trapped by plastic pollution on two remote islands, a new study from the University of Tasmania found.
Research teams estimated that about 508,000 of the crustaceans have been killed in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean and about 61,000 on Henderson Island in the Pacific after getting stuck in debris such as plastic bottles, which researchers said served as "deadly traps."
Hermit crabs do not have shells of their own, and instead use empty shells or hollow objects to shelter and protect their bodies.
"When we were surveying debris on the islands, I was struck by how many open plastic containers contained hermit crabs, both dead and alive," Dr Jennifer Lavers, who led the study, said in a statement.
The study, led by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania, found that discarded plastic created a "physical barrier" for wildlife attempting to navigate their surroundings and acted as a trap for the crabs.
The research team carried out surveys across a range of sites on the islands to establish how many containers had potential to trap the crabs, and found that around 1-2 crabs per square meter had been trapped by the debris.
'Gruesome chain reaction'
Dr Alex Bond, from London's Natural History Museum, which assisted with the study, described the problem as "insidious."
He said: "Hermit crabs do not have a shell of their own, which means that when one of their compatriots die, they emit a chemical signal that basically says 'there's a shell available' attracting more crabs who fall into the containers and die, who then send out more signals that say there are more shells available."
"Essentially it is this gruesome chain reaction," he added.
In the study, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials , researchers warned that marine plastic pollution is a global issue, and that comparable losses of the crabs on a global scale would impact on ecosystems.
"Hermit crabs play a crucial role in the health of tropical environments by aerating and fertilising soil, and dispersing seeds and removing detritus, as well being a key part of the marine ecosystem," Lavers warned. "Their population degradation is more than just a risk to the natural environment," she added.
"High concentrations of debris are now being encountered on beaches around the world, many of which are also home to hermit crabs that can be expected to interact with plastic pollution in the same way as those we studied," Lavers added.
In May, researchers revealed that 414 million pieces of plastic were found washed ashore on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.
Much of the rubbish was single-use consumer items such as bottle caps, straws, shoes and sandals, eco-toxicologists from the University of Tasmania said at the time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sky-watchers, look out -- the next full moon is coming soon, and it has an interesting time and date.
The full moon will be Dec. 12, and it will be completely full at 12:12 a.m. EST, Space.com reported.
That’s the exact time the sun 100% illuminates the moon. For the west coast, the time will be 9:12 p.m. PST.
It will be called the Cold Moon and will be the last one of 2019, Travel and Leisure reported.
It also is called the Long Night’s Moon and the Moon Before Yule.
According to the Farmers Almanac, the number 12 has some significance in numerology. It’s at the end of the spectrum and allows the wrap-up of events before moving on.
In Chinese numerology, the number represents yin and yang. One is a yang number that is ruled by the sun. Two is a yin ruled by the Moon, according to the almanac.
The full moon will be followed by the Geminid Meteor Showers, according to Space.com.
The peak is Dec. 13 but could be seen after peak times over the next few days. About 20 to 30 meteors an hour may be visible due to the brightness of the moon. Normally they peak at 2 a.m. local time but can be seen as early as 9 p.m.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Images Show Asteroid Bennu Spewing Bits of Itself Into Space</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Images taken by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are helping scientists to understand why small particles are occasionally flying off the surface of Bennu, a nearly spherical asteroid that resembles a spinning top.
Discovered just 20 years ago, Bennu is perhaps most famously known for having the second-highest risk rating on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale, having a one in 2,700 chance of smashing into Earth between the years 2175 and 2199. Bennu may or may not collide with Earth one day, but we’re learning a lot more about this asteroid and what makes it tick, thanks to NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which has been observing Bennu since October 2018.
Bennu is about 500 metres (1,640 feet) across, and with its bulging equator, it looks a bit like a child’s spinning top. The near-Earth asteroid features a relatively smooth surface, save for a couple of boulders in its southern hemisphere that stick out like gigantic warts. Compositionally, its chemical makeup is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, which represent some of the oldest known meteorites in the solar system. Bennu is basically a pile of rubble, featuring dense spots and some empty voids within.
As close-up observations taken by OSIRIS-REx’s navigation camera have shown, Bennu is an active asteroid, regularly shedding some of its surface material.

OSIRIS-REx is currently scouting Bennu’s surface in search of a good place to extract samples, which it’s scheduled to do next year. Over the course of its observations, however, the spacecraft has seen several episodes in which the asteroid flung small bits and pieces of itself into space. These observations initially caused alarm at NASA, with mission scientists worrying that the spacecraft might be in danger of getting whacked. They eventually decided that OSIRIS-REx was safe and no countermeasures were necessary, allowing OSIRIS-REx to keep making up-close observations.
New research published Thursday in Science describes this shedding behaviour in detail, while offering some explanations as to why it’s happening.
Indeed, why Bennu should be doing this is not immediately obvious, given that the object is an asteroid and not a comet. Comets, which are packed with large quantities of ice, are famously known for having active surfaces, forming comas and long tails of gas and dust when near the Sun. Asteroids, though diverse in terms of their composition, aren’t as exciting from a visual perspective, but a subset known as active asteroids feature dynamic surfaces.
From our vantage point on Earth, we can see thousands upon thousands of asteroids, but it’s extremely difficult to observe what’s happening on their surfaces from so far away. That said, astronomers have previously documented the shedding of materials from active asteroids using ground-based telescopes, but they’re quite rare, with only a handful having been documented since the 1990s, including the active asteroid (6478) Gault.
Less obvious, however, are active asteroids that shed small amounts of material into space, like Bennu. The OSIRIS-REx mission is giving us an unprecedented view of this process, allowing scientists to finally get a handle on the phenomenon.
Planetary scientist Dante Lauretta, the first author of the new study and a researcher from the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, and his colleagues studied the close-up shots of Bennu’s shedding events. Nearly a dozen individual episodes have been chronicled, but the new paper looked at the three largest events, all of which happened earlier this year.
These events appeared as tiny bright dots of light in the OSIRIX-REx photographs. The researchers estimated the size of the particles at just a few centimetres, which were seen moving just above the asteroid’s surface. During each of the three events, between 72 and 200 of these tiny particles left the surface, and all three events transpired during the afternoon on Bennu – the warmest part of the asteroid’s brief 4.3-hour day. Some of these rejected remnants remained in Bennu’s orbit for a few days prior to reuniting with the surface, but some pieces managed to escape altogether, drifting away into space.

Lauretta and his colleagues ruled out several possible causes for these ejections, namely ice sublimation (when ice converts directly to vapour, bypassing the liquid stage), rotational disruption (in which a high rate of spin can cause asteroid to break apart), and electrostatic effects. Instead, the shedding events were attributed to a multifaceted process involving collisions with micro-meteorites, dehydration, and thermal stress fracturing – all of which are conspiring, either individually or collectively, to cause particles to leave Bennu’s surface.
That thermal fracturing might be involved is no joke, as surface temperatures on Bennu oscillate wildly. At the asteroid’s mid-latitudes, where two of the three shedding events occurred, the surface temperatures dropped to a low of 250 Kelvin (-23 degrees Celsius, -10 degrees Fahrenheit) but then swung to a high of 400 Kelvin (127 degrees C, 260 degrees F), according to the new paper. This causes cracks to form, which destabilises surface materials.
This mission is far from over, as OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to collect surface samples in 2020, with a scheduled return date to Earth in 2023.

The space agency is looking for a safe and easily accessible spot, which won’t be easy. At the same time, the spot also has to be scientifically interesting, such as areas with carbon-rich materials or a crater that has exposed younger materials. Whichever landing site NASA chooses, it appears we have lots to look forward to next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deforestation Is a Death Sentence for Tropical Forest Animals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The wildlife that rely on tropical rainforests may be more screwed than we thought. A new study has found that tropical forest species are six times more sensitive to forest fragmentation than species in temperate ecosystems.
The research published in Science on Thursday takes a deep dive into the topic of forest fragmentation, which occurs when vast forestlands are cut up into smaller patches due to logging, farming, or fires. Forest fragmentation is bad for all of us but especially the species that inhabit it and other tropical rainforests also under siege.
That’s due to a number of reasons: less land for animals to call home, increased vulnerability to predators, and the cascade effects throughout the ecosystem. However, some species deal better with reduced tree cover and increased forest edge habitat – and that’s largely those that have had a chance to practice. The results have huge implications for conservation going forward.
“These [findings] really emphasise the importance of conserving habitat in these areas and, in particular, conserving large blocks or large areas of contiguous habitat that will help prevent fragmentation from having negative effects on species,” said study author Christopher Wolf, a research associate at Oregon State University’s Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society.
The authors—who hail from universities and institutions around the world – used 73 datasets to analyse 4,489 animal species including birds, reptilians, arthropods, and mammals.

These datasets include geographic points throughout specific landscapes around the planet and what animal species scientists have recorded there, as well as their abundance. From there, the team of researchers categorised these species by specific habitats. Some preferred forests with heavy tree cover far from the forest edge. Others were found along the edge. And then there were those animals that seem to make a home just about anywhere in the forest.
Animals that avoid the edge of forests are the most sensitive to this type of fragmentation. If scientists aren’t finding them here, it’s likely because they can’t succeed in such a habitat. More than half the species living in low-disturbance regions (which generally covers tropical forests) avoid edge zones. In high-disturbance regions (which are generally temperate forests), that percentage drops to about 18 per cent.
The research suggests the reason for the differences is a result of natural destruction that preceded humanity’s attack on forests. Thousands of years before destructive humans walked the Earth setting fire to shit and cutting down everything they could see, many ecosystems still saw major disturbances in the form of fires, glaciations, and hurricanes. Temperate forests at higher latitudes have tended to be disturbed more regularly, and researchers argue that these places have fewer sensitive species and more resilient ones as a result.
As for tropical forests? They haven’t generally seen this level of change throughout history to have the evolutionary upper hand in the modern era where humans are the cause of massive deforestation, which is a bummer given how deforestation just does not let up throughout tropical regions. These findings are also particularly worrisome because tropical rainforests support at least two-thirds of the world’s biodiversity. Think of the Amazon, for example. Years of deforestation (which has skyrocketed this year) has fragmented it so much that scientists predict it could essentially become two separate forests within a few decades.
But the new findings confirm these species in tropical forests all around the world are at risk. And these patterns were fairly consistent across taxonomic groups. In other words, birds, reptiles, and mammals in tropical forests are equally fucked. The Sunda clouded leopard of Borneo forest is under threat. As is the great tinamou of Central and South America, a cute grey little hunchback ground bird. Every ecosystem requires special local attention to figure out how to properly protect the animals that call it home, but these findings support the drive to set aside larger blocks of tropical forests if we want to conserve biodiversity.
Given the amount of data the researchers analysed, there’s always a chance they categorised an animal, Wolf said. And the data they’ve received may contain some bias depending on where data points are located throughout a landscape, but that’s something the researchers controlled for in their models. They’re confident in their results. And given the way tropical forests have been treated over the past few decades, that should scare the shit out of all of us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Severe drought — Once mighty Victoria Falls dries to a trickle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Falls, also known as "Mosi-oa-Tunya" - "The Smoke That Thunders" in the indigenous Lozi language is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The waters of the Zambezi River cascades 108 meters (355 feet) down into a gash in the earth, drawing millions of visitors from around the world.
However, this year's drought in south-central Africa has taken the thunder out of the natural wonder, leaving the falls a mere whimper of its former self. While the falls typically slow down during the hot African summer, this drought is the worst in almost a century.
“In previous years, when it gets dry, it’s not to this extent. This (is) our first experience of seeing it like this,” said Dominic Nyambe, a seller of tourist handicrafts, reports the Irish Times. “It affects us, because ... clients ... can see on the Internet (that the falls are low) ... We don’t have so many tourists.”
Photos taken in January this year are in stark contrast to photos taken this month. In January, water was plentiful, cascading over the falls and creating the landmark mist that is so awe-inspiring. Now, all that is seen is a rock wall.
"Flow of the Zambezi River varies sharply from its mid- to late-rainy season maximum, then bottoms at the time of the first widespread rains," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Jim Andrews said. "Any delay in the onset of rain can allow river levels to continue to wane, potentially for weeks, depending on steering controls for the weather."
Even as world leaders are meeting at COP25 in Madrid, Spain to discuss ways to halt the catastrophic warming caused by human-driven greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is suffering some of the very worst effects of the climate crisis. Taps are running dry and over 45 million people are in need of food aid as crops wither in the fields.
Zimbabwe and Zambia are heavily reliant on hydropower from plants at the Kariba dam, below the falls. There have been extensive power cuts affecting homes and businesses. Data from the Zambezi River Authority shows the water flow at its lowest since 1995 - and well below the long-term average, according to The Guardian.
With all that is happening, scientists are cautious about categorically blaming climate change because there are seasonal variations. Harald Kling, a hydrologist at engineering firm Poyry and a Zambezi river expert, said climate science dealt in decades, not particular years, “so it’s sometimes difficult to say this is because of climate change because droughts have always occurred”.
“If they become more frequent, then you can start saying: OK, this may be climate change.” While noting that current climate models had predicted more frequent dry years in the Zambezi basin - “what was surprising was that it [drought] has been so frequent.” The last drought was only three years ago. As the river got hotter, 437 million cubic meters (15 billion cubic feet) of water were evaporating every second.
Back in October, Zambian President Edgar Chagwa Lungu fired a warning shot on Twitter, posting photos of the barren falls and declaring the images are a "stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment and our livelihood."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A further difference with wine and beer, is that wine tends to improve with age, whereas beer deteriorates. Most beer, within a year or so of bottling, forms an unpleasant ‘cardboard-like’ flavor (going 'stale' in a beer drinker’s lexicography).
To help to extend how long a bottle or can of beer might last for, food scientists from China have genetically engineered a lager yeast so that the fungus produces a greater abundance of molecules.
These molecules function to that protect the beer against staling, not only extending the hold time but, according to those who have tasted the beer, producing an improved flavor.
The role of yeast
With the beer production process, the fermentation of cereal extracts by the yeast Saccharomyces is the most important microbial process. The as a fermentation end product. The final alcohol content is determined by comparing the initial and final specific gravities.
New research
, researchers have connected stale beer flavors to aldehyde compounds. These compounds include (E)-2-nonenal and acetaldehyde. These chemicals are generated by yeast during fermentation. The chemicals are also produced via chemical reactions occurring during beer storage.
While there has been some experimentation using anti-oxidants, the research team led by Professor Qi Li attempted to genetically modify lager yeast so that it produces higher levels of a chemical called NADH. The theory runs that higher quantities of NADH will raise the activities of natural yeast enzymes which can convert the unwanted aldehydes into other compounds which will not create the stale flavor, the researchers.
To achieve the required modification of the yeast the science team deployed a genetic technique termed "." Here they artificially increased the levels of different genes connected to NADH production. Specifically, the researchers focused on four genes that, when overexpressed, led to higher NADH levels.
The yeast, when tested out, created beers which contained nearly 50 percent less acetaldehyde compared with beer produced using unmodified yeasts. Over time the beer had reduced staling.
Research paper
The new technique has the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. The peer-reviewed research is titled “Higher NADH availability of lager yeast increases the flavor stability of beer.”
Other scientific secrets to a good beer
There are other factors which go towards forming a good beer. For example, scientists have shown how too high a temperature can ruin many a lager. To address the heat issue, scientists have looked into the issue of keeping yeast cool to overcome the problem that arises when yeast become hot this leads to change to the taste of a beer. requires experimentation so that the right amount of nutrients are available.
Other branches of scientific research are in order to genetically create new yeasts suitable for lager brewing.
Many craft breweries are turning towards spectrophotometric technology in order to provide rapid and precise measurements so that distinctive beers can be created. A recent variant is a technology .

    <h5 class="mb-1">Betelgeuse Is “Fainting” But It's Not About To Explode. Probably</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A ripple of excitement is passing through the community of astronomers, both amateur and professional, at reports that Betelgeuse has dimmed significantly over recent days. Those who study the star most closely are hosing down the idea the world is about to experience perhaps the greatest event in the history of astronomy, but that doesn't mean there isn't something interesting going on.
To understand the fuss it is necessary to know that Betelgeuse, the deep red star in Orion's shoulder is a red supergiant with a mass large enough that it will inevitably become a supernova one day. Moreover, given its development, that day will be soon, by astronomical standards.
When this occurs, it will be a truly awe-inspiring sight. Betelgeuse is conveniently placed, far enough away there will be no danger to Earth, but close enough that its brightness will be breathtaking, possibly outshining the full Moon.
While there are several nearby stars that will eventually become supernovae, Betelgeuse probably heads the queue. There is general agreement its maximum life expectancy is less than a million years, and one study estimates its remaining life at 100,000. An explosion in our lifetimes is not likely, but more credible than for fellow supergiants like Antares or Spica.
Consequently, the report of a sudden dip in brightness, referred to as a “fainting”, hasn't been received quite the way it would have with any other star. Nevertheless, two explanations have been offered, each more likely than the possibility this is a prelude to stellar Armageddon.
The first point astronomers have noted is that Betelgeuse is a variable star, whose brightness is constantly changing. Although recent measurements have it fainter than anything previously recorded, we know it is operating on multiple cycles. When the minimums of each cycle come together, the star will look particularly faint, but will brighten soon after.
 
Alternatively, with a stellar wind ordinarily a million times that of the Sun, Betelgeuse could have ejected more dust than usual, obscuring it enough to cause the dimming.
Either way, establishing the explanation should be fun, but not that much fun.
Meanwhile, the nearby supernova drought continues. A galaxy the size of the Milky Way would normally have around one supernova every 100 years. Yet not has been seen since the invention of the telescope, the last occurring in 1604. The only supernova visible to the naked eye since then occurred 32 years ago in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a hundred times more distant than Betelgeuse, and astronomers are still writing papers on what they saw.
Oh well, at least we get to marvel a little longer at a star so bloated Jupiter's whole orbit would fit inside. And there is always Eta Carinae.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not many people would be able to control themselves if they were expecting to open a box full of small fluffy critters and instead found a gathering of large furry spiders. Fewer still would be excited about this plot twist – unless you’re conservationists in Australia, of course.
But, this is exactly what happened to members of Bush Heritage Australia recently, as described by ecologist Angela Sanders in a blog post.
The not-for-profit organization buys and manages land across Australia in an attempt to conserve its unique landscape and species. One of these regions of restored habitat is the Monjebup North reserve in Western Australia. After decades of land cleared for farmland, the reservation is allowing the natural revegetation of native bushland, trees, shrubs, and animal life to flourish.
One of the animals returning to this habitat is the utterly adorable western pygmy possum – smaller than your hand, fluffy, all Disney eyes, and improbably long whiskers. Pygmy possums usually nest in the hollows of trees, but at seven years old, the restored habitat is still a bit too young to provide these just yet, so the organization gave the furry little bundles a helping hand in the form of wooden nest boxes, and they quickly took up residence.
When they went to check on the success of the nesting boxes, they discovered the possums weren't the only new residents to move in though.
When asked if anybody jumped on discovering the unexpected house guests, Sanders told IFLScience: "We certainly jump back a bit when we open a box seething with spiders, as they do run up your arm if you’re not quick enough!" 
Huntsmans, like the possums, live in trees, under loose bark, and as the restored vegetation is too young for them as well, it appears they also liked the look of these snazzy new homes. Sanders explains that bark is in short supply in the restored habitat, so the wooden boxes looked suitable, and they were plenty big enough to bring the whole family. Contrary to what you might think, this is actually a good thing.
"Huntsman spiders being in the nest boxes does suggest improved ecosystem complexity, they feed on insects and other invertebrates and lay their egg sac inside the box," Sanders told IFLScience. "They would have been present in the larger remnant trees and logs in the paddocks and would have [eventually] moved into the revegetated areas as we restored the land."
"They quickly found the nest boxes and were recorded using them just months after first installing them."  
Most spiders are solitary, but some species of huntsman spiders are more social creatures, sharing habitats and even working together to share resources. Scientists think this is a way for all of the spiders to benefit by living comfortably, sharing food, and possibly even safety in numbers.
The good news is that the habitat is clearly on its way back to restoration if huntsmans to want to move in. This means food is plentiful, and the habitat is becoming strong enough to support many species up and down the food chain.  
And the pygmy possums – which monitoring has shown are using the boxes regularly – don't seem too annoyed by their new neighbors, although perhaps not ready to join in the snuggle just yet. "We do find a single adult spider or two in the same box as a pygmy possum but haven’t found the possums in any of the boxes with lots of spiders," said Sanders.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Big Bertha: A 25,000 HP Mechanical Worm Designed in Japan for American Drilling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s a known fact that engineers, in their constant pursuit for innovations, have learned a good amount from nature itself, as it provides one of the best sources of inspiration.
Before we even existed as a species, nature was already working tirelessly, creating and shaping an effective system in which all elements coexist harmoniously.
Therefore, in a never-ending quest that seeks ingenious and sustainable solutions for our “human challenges”, it seems like emulating nature’s approaches and patterns is the way to go, as its experience in the field is millions of times greater than ours. This term is called Biomimicry, and it represents the process of making use of innovations that exist and work in nature, and applying them to technology development.
And so it happened when the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) decided to build, well dig to be more precise, an alternative for the Alaskan Way Viaduct which has been damaged and deemed seismically unsafe after an earthquake named Nisqually hit Seattle back in 2001.
So what do you do when you have to build a 9,270 feet long (2,830 meters) four-lane tunnel at about 200 feet (60 meters) underground, whilst also not damaging the foundations of the city’s skyscrapers and historical buildings? You commission Hitachi Zosen from Japan to build a 57.5 feet (17.5 meters) diameter, 326 feet (99 meters) long worm that weighs over 6,000 tons, and you name it Big Bertha.
To understand how a modern tunnel boring machine works, imagine a giant earthworm (I know, but bear with me) - the worm eats, the worm moves forward, and the worm spews waste from itself, so in general terms that was the working principle that the machine should respect.
With a head drill composed of 260 fixed and moving cutters, performing a full revolution every minute, and a total weight of around 800 tons, Big Bertha was good for “chewing” around 35 feet (10 meters) of soil every day, thanks to its massive 25,000 horsepower engine. The head is also fitted with special nozzles to mimic a “salivary” system, which turns the waste soil onto a mass with the consistency similar to a paste, easier to move around.
Next comes the “digestion”, where a lot of waste is squeezed onto a huge rubber screw (such as an Archimedean screw) which, thanks to its special design for Big Bertha, can handle chunks of stones up to a meter across. The screw then drives the load to that part of the machine, which can be called "guts" for the lack of any other elegant analogy. Long story short, a conveyor belt removes the waste from the tunnel and unloads it into a barge, moored to the shore of the bay.
The conveyor belt increases in size along with the progress that Bertha makes by drilling, in this case, by the end of its mission it reached around 9,000 feet (2,700 meters). If it wasn’t for this ingenious solution, up to 200 dump trucks would have been released daily to the streets of downtown Seattle in order to transport the waste soil away from the construction site, or they’d have to purchase a couple BelAZ monsters.
If you think that is amazing, the Japanese-built Bertha also installed the concrete panels, building the walls of the tunnel as it goes, and leaving an almost finished project behind. Now that’s impressive.
The whole process should have taken Bertha, on paper at least, around two and a half years, but after just 10% of work disaster struck. Chaos had been created as temperatures spiked, alarm bells started ringing resulting in stopping the giant from digging. After investigating that took a month, WSDOT announced that the cutting blades of the machine encountered a long steel pipe, one of several that were left from a previous drilling project in 2002, following the earthquake in 2001.
Since the machine cannot cut through metal, the pipe damaged several of Berta's cutting blades, requiring a replacement blade before the machine could continue. The weird thing is that WSDOT apparently knew about the location of these steel pipes, and the agency responsible for the project were assured that they were removed. It is currently unclear whether the government or one of its contractors is responsible for the pipes being left behind.
Multiple options have been discussed to solve the problem, resulting in an out of commission period of almost a year. After a long 48 months underground, the besieged behemoth clawed its way into daylight leaving a 1.7-mile long tunnel behind it.
With the job done, Bertha’s mission is now complete and a not so bright future awaits. The front end will be carved up and trucked away, with parts such as wires and motors to be saved and sold back to the manufacturer. A significant part of the steel will go to the local iron foundry for re-melting, after which the metal will be used to build the highway inside the new tunnel.
The tunnel was opened for traffic on February 4, 2019 and it represents one of the marvels of engineering and sustainable solutions. 🏁

    <h5 class="mb-1">It's Official: Stress Is Making Us Age Faster</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Centennials often cite a low-stress, carefree lifestyle as the secret to their longevity. We now know that stresses can make your body clock break into a sprint at a molecular level. Here's what you need to know.
Ageing is an inevitability for all living organisms, and although we still don’t know exactly why our bodies gradually grow ever more decrepit, we are starting to grasp how it happens.
Our new research, published in Ecology Letters, pinpoints factors that influence one of the most important aspects of the ageing process, at the fundamental level of our DNA. It suggests how stress can cause the biochemical body clock built into our chromosomes to tick faster.
DNA - the genetic material in our cells - does not float freely in cells’ nuclei, but is organised into clumps called chromosomes. When a cell divides and produces a replica of itself, it has to make a copy of its DNA, and because of the way this process works, a tiny portion is always lost at one end of each DNA molecule.
To protect vital portions of DNA from being lost in the process, the ends of chromosomes are capped with special sequences called telomeres. These are gradually whittled away during successive cell divisions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Research draws on Formula 1 technology for the construction of skyscrapers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">City, University London draws on Formula 1 technology for the construction of "needle-like" skyscrapers.
Researchers City, University of London are developing new vibration-control devices based on Formula 1 technology so "needle-like" high-rise skyscrapers which still withstand high winds can be built
Current devices called tuned mass dampers (TMDs) are fitted in the top floors of tall buildings to act like heavyweight pendulums counteracting building movement caused by winds and earthquakes. But they weigh up to 1,000 tons and span five storeys in 100-storey buildings—adding millions to building costs and using up premium space in tight city centres.
Recent research work published by Dr. Agathoklis Giaralis (an expert in structural dynamics at City, University of London), and his colleagues, published in the November 2019 edition of the Engineering Structures journal (Optimal tuned mass damper inter design in wind-excited tall buildings for occupants' comfort serviceability, preferences and energy harvesting) found that lightweight and compact inerters, similar to those developed for the suspension systems of Formula 1 cars, can reduce the required weight of current TMDs by up to 70%.
Dr. Giaralis said: "If we can achieve smaller, lighter TMDs, then we can build taller and thinner buildings without causing seasickness for occupants when it is windy. Such slender structures will require fewer materials and resources, and so will cost less and be more sustainable, while taking up less space and also being aesthetically more pleasing to the eye. In a city like London, where space is at a premium and land is expensive, the only real option is to go up, so this technology can be a game-changer."
Tests have shown that up to 30% less steel is needed in beams and columns of typical 20-storey steel building thanks to the new devices. Computer model analyses for an existing London building, the 48-storey Newington Butts in Elephant and Castle, Southwark, had shown that "floor acceleration"—the measure of occupants' comfort against seasickness—can be reduced by 30% with the newly proposed technology.
"This reduction in floor acceleration is significant," added Dr. Giaralis. "It means the devices are also more effective in ensuring that buildings can withstand high winds and earthquakes. Even moderate winds can cause seasickness or dizziness to occupants and climate change suggests that stronger winds will become more frequent. The inerter-based vibration control technology we are testing is demonstrating that it can significantly reduce this risk with low up-front cost in new, even very slender, buildings and with small structural modifications in existing buildings."Dr. Giaralis said there was a further advantage:
"As well as achieving reduced carbon emissions through requiring fewer materials, we can also harvest energy from wind-induced oscillations—I don't believe that we are able at the moment to have a building that is completely self-sustaining using this technology, but we can definitely harvest enough for powering wireless sensors used for inner building climate control."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bragg diffraction monitors wound healing, plastic soil and other physical science innovations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Friday I was at the Institute of Physics (IOP) in London for an event called “Showcasing Physical Sciences Impact”, which was organized by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI)  and sponsored jointly by the IOP and the Royal Society of Chemistry.
There were a range of speakers from funding agencies such as UKRI, academia and industry, who talked about the far-reaching and varied impacts of physical sciences research.
I was particularly intrigued by a talk by the University of Sheffield chemist Tony Ryan, who goes by the moniker “Professor Plastic”. He spoke about his work on recycling and reusing plastics, including schemes for making plastic soils that can be used to grow plants in desert environments.
There was also a small exhibition of research projects from UK universities and I enjoyed having a chat with some of the exhibitors. Pictured above is Ruchi Gupta, who is a chemist at the University of Birmingham. Her research group has developed an optical biosensor that can be embedded in a wound dressing, and Gupta is holding a model of the layered structure.
Normally when a chronic wound such as a diabetic ulcer is dressed it cannot be inspected without removing the dressing – which can be painful and disrupt the healing process. Gupta’s biosensor allows doctors to determine whether a wound has become infected by revealing the presence of biomolecules that are associated with infection. This is done by embedding antibodies (shown in turquoise in the photo) in alternating layers of optical materials that form a Bragg reflector – which converts white light to monochromatic light of a certain colour.
When the biomolecules of interest bind to the antibodies, they change the colour of the reflected light – thereby revealing infection. As well as applications in healthcare, the technology could also be used other areas such as food security and environmental monitoring by using antibodies that capture different types of molecules.
I also had a chat with the physics Sebastian Weidt of the University of Sussex, who was exhibiting the “Sussex modular microwave ion quantum computer”. The device uses trapped ions as quantum bits (qubits), which are entangled and processed using microwaves. This, according to Weidt, offers a solution to the problem of scaling-up ion-based quantum computers, which would normally require impractically large numbers of laser beams.
Staying on the theme of quantum information, I also met Catherine Phillips at the University of Sheffield who had Alice, Bob and Eve in a plastic box. More precisely, she had a demonstration of how the principles of quantum mechanics could be used to prevent eavesdropper Eve from listening-in on a conversation between Alice and Bob.
In the above photo you can just make out several optically-levitated nanoparticles that are being held by green laser light in the middle of the cube-like structure at the centre of the image. This demonstration belongs to James Millen of King’s College London, who is developing ways of using trapped nano-objects as inertial sensors. As well as being sensitive to linear accelerations, trapped nanoparticles can also be made to rotate and could therefore be useful in detecting angular accelerations.
I just put on a jumper because I thought the office was getting a bit chilly, but then when I looked at a nearby thermometer it registered a balmy 25 °C. Perhaps we should invest in a new type of thermometer that has been developed by Michael de Podesta and colleagues at the UK’s National Physical Laboratory. That’s de Podesta in the above photo, blowing warm air into the device, which works out the temperature by measuring the speed of sound through the column of air between the two discs. If you look at the red plot on the laptop you can see a sudden jump in the temperature as his breath enters the column.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Study projects scenarios for water use reduction in thermal power plants using satellite imagery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Water and energy are closely linked, as current electricity generation methods often require water, and extracting water typically consumes energy. This connection between water and energy, also known as the "water-energy nexus," has been the focus of several scientific studies.
Among other things, achieving water and energy security worldwide entails finding sustainable ways of connecting research related to the water demand of powerplants with mitigation strategies for energy-based water use. Ultimately, studies that jointly investigate these two important factors could pave the way toward new solutions that ensure a more sustainable use of both water and energy.
With this in mind, a team of researchers at LUT University in Finland has recently investigated water use in thermal power plants, trying to project future scenarios for water use reduction in light of the ongoing shift toward a greener economy. In their study, featured in Nature Energy, they assessed the water footprint of a large number of thermal power plants worldwide and estimated the current water demand for power production at four different levels: globally, regionally, by country and by river.
"We linked a total of 13,863 thermal power plants with a total active capacity of 4,182 GW worldwide, which corresponds to 95.8 percent of the global thermal power plant fleet, to water bodies using the method of geographic information system (GIS) analysis, then estimated the water footprint of each of them," Alena Lohrmann, first author of the study, told Tech Xplore.
Recent research has suggested that a radical shift toward renewable energy is both technically and economically feasible. Nonetheless, whether this shift will actually take place or at what pace it will unfold is still somewhat unclear.
Essentially, Lohrmann and her colleagues wanted to carry out realistic estimations for the development of water demand that could provide valuable and reliable insight about possible future water use reduction scenarios. To achieve this, the researchers first identified the cooling technology employed at individual power plants. Subsequently, they carried out an in-depth analysis to determine seawater and freshwater demand of global thermal power plants.
The data used in their analyses was taken mainly from the GlobalData dataset, which contains information about several thousands of thermal power plants worldwide. To overcome the data limitations of the dataset, the cooling technology of each power plant was identified using satellite imagery.
"Our study also presents an impact analysis for 354 major rivers globally carried out in a high temporal and spatial resolution," Lohrmann said. "This river analysis is of high relevance since thermal power plants mainly affect local aquatic ecosystems due to thermal pollution and increased water discharge."
After estimating the global water demand, the researchers created a 'best policies scenario' (BPS) model using a modeling tool developed at LUT University, called LUT Energy System Transition model. Using this tool, they successfully identified the most affordable scenario for shifting toward 100 percent renewable electricity by 2050, thus meeting global sustainability targets.
"Our study provides the assessment of the potential water use reduction in global thermal power plants from 2015 (base year) to 2050," Christian Breyer, head of the team who carried out the study, told TechXplore. "We showed that the transition toward a 100 percent renewable electricity system might reduce global water consumption of thermal power plants by 97.7 percent."
The study carried out by Lohrmann, Breyer and their colleagues offers an interesting new perspective on how industries and governments worldwide could encourage a lower water use in power generation. In addition to highlighting the feasibility of moving toward significantly more sustainable solutions, their work identifies a cost-effective strategy that could help to tackle the issue of water depletion associated with the use of water to create electrical energy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Advanced technology may indicate how brain learns faces</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Facial recognition technology has advanced swiftly in the last five years. As University of Texas at Dallas researchers try to determine how computers have gotten as good as people at the task, they are also shedding light on how the human brain sorts information.
UT Dallas scientists have analyzed the performance of the latest echelon of facial recognition algorithms, revealing the surprising way these programs—which are based on machine learning—work. Their study, published online Nov. 12 in Nature Machine Intelligence, shows that these sophisticated computer programs—called deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs)—figured out how to identify faces differently than the researchers expected.
"For the last 30 years, people have presumed that computer-based visual systems get rid of all the image-specific information—angle, lighting, expression and so on," said Dr. Alice O'Toole, senior author of the study and the Aage and Margareta Møller Professor in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences. "Instead, the algorithms keep that information while making the identity more important, which is a fundamentally new way of thinking about the problem."
In machine learning, computers analyze large amounts of data in order to learn to recognize patterns, with the goal of being able to make decisions with minimal human input. O'Toole said the progress made by machine learning for facial recognition since 2014 has "changed everything by quantum leaps."
"Things that were never doable before, that have impeded computer vision technology for 30 years, became not only doable, but pretty easy," O'Toole said. "The catch is that nobody understood how it works."
Previous-generation algorithms were effective in recognizing faces that had only minor changes from the image they already knew. Current technology, however, knows an identity well enough to overcome changes in expression, viewpoint or appearance, such as removing glasses.
"These new algorithms operate more like you and me," O'Toole said. "That's in part because they have accumulated a massive amount of experience with variations in how one identity can appear. But that's not the whole picture."
O'Toole's team set about learning how the learning algorithms operate—both to substantiate the trust put into their results and, as lead author Matthew Hill explained, to shed light on how the visual cortex of the human brain performs the same task.
"The structure of this type of neural network was originally inspired by how the brain processes visual information," said Hill, a cognition and neuroscience doctoral student. "Because it excels at solving the same problems that the brain does, it can give insight into how the brain solves the problem."
The origins of the type of neural network algorithm that the team studied dates back to 1980, but the power of neural networks grew exponentially more than 30 years later.
"Early this decade, two things happened: The internet gave this program millions of images and identities to work with—unbelievable amounts of easily available data—and computing power grew, so that, instead of having two or three layers of 'neurons' in the neural network, you can have more than 100 layers, as this system now does," O'Toole said.
Despite the algorithm's intended purpose, the scale of its calculations—which number at least in the tens of millions—means scientists are unable to understand everything that it does.
"Even though the algorithm was designed to model neuron behavior in the brain, we can't keep track of everything done between input and output," said Connor Parde, an author of the paper and a cognition and neuroscience doctoral student. "So we have to focus our research on the output."
To demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities, the team used caricatures, extreme versions of an identity, which Y. Ivette Colón BS'17, a research assistant and another author of the study, described as "the most 'you' version of you."
"Caricatures exaggerate your unique identity relative to everyone else's," O'Toole said. "In a way, that's exactly what the algorithm wants to do: highlight what makes you different from everyone else."
To the surprise of the researchers, the DCNN actually excelled at connecting caricatures to their corresponding identities.
"Given these distorted images with features out of proportion, the network understands that these are the same features that make an identity distinctive and correctly connects the caricature to the identity," O'Toole said. "It sees that distinctive identity in ways that none of us anticipated."
So, as computer systems begin to equal—and, on occasion, surpass—the facial recognition performance of humans, could the algorithm's basis for sorting information resemble what the human brain does?
To find out, a better understanding is needed of the human visual cortex. The most detailed information available is via images obtained via functional MRI, which can be used to image the activity of the brain while a subject is performing a mental task. Hill described fMRI as "too noisy" to see the small details.
"The resolution of an fMRI is nowhere near what you need to see what's happening with the activity of individual neurons," Hill said. "With these networks, you have every computation. That allows us to ask: Could identities be organized this way in our minds?"
O'Toole's lab will tackle that question next, thanks to a recent grant of more than $1.5 million across four years from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health.
"The NIH has tasked us with the biological question: How relevant are these results for human visual perception?" she said. "We have four years of funding to find an answer."

    <h5 class="mb-1">A decade of Physics World breakthroughs: 2014 – landing a spacecraft on a comet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the Physics World 2019 Breakthrough of the Year due to be announced on 12 December, Physics World journalists look back at the past decade of winners and explore how research in that field has moved on. Here Margaret Harris reflects on the 2014 breakthrough, which went to the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission “for landing a spacecraft on a comet”
Landing stuff on other worlds is hard. Just ask the people behind the Vikram lunar lander, which crashed onto the Moon in September 2019; or the Beresheet lunar lander, which met a similar fate in April; or the Mars Polar Lander, or the Beagle 2, or – well, you get the picture.
So when a little craft called Philae descended towards the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, touched down briefly, bounced off the surface, landed, bounced again, and finally came to rest on this 4.1km by 4.3km chunk of interplanetary ice, we thought it was quite an accomplishment. A month later, the ESA team behind the Philae lander and its parent Rosetta mission won Physics World’s 2014 “Breakthrough of the Year” for making the first non-destructive landing of a spacecraft on a comet nucleus.
In hindsight, Philae’s survival was something of a lucky accident. The harpoon that was meant to secure it to 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko failed to fire. A set of thrusters designed to push it onto the comet didn’t work either. And when the craft finally came to rest, it was in an awkward location, stuck on its side in a dark crevice that prevented its solar panels from functioning and made communication a challenge.
Fortune favours the well-prepared, though, and the ESA team made the most of Philae’s 57-hour operational life, gathering reams of scientific data from a suite of onboard instruments before the probe’s batteries failed. Among other achievements, Philae sniffed out organic molecules on the comet’s surface and discovered that the material in its immediate vicinity was much harder than expected. Studies of the comet’s deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio also lent support to the theory that asteroids, rather than comets, brought water to Earth – an important contribution to our understanding of the early solar system.
Missions like Rosetta don’t come along very often, so it’s not surprising that no-one else has landed on a comet since 2014 (or tried to). But the success of ESA’s lander fired imaginations and fuelled an interest in the solar system’s smaller objects that continues today. Just last week, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission announced a series of discoveries about particle ejections from an asteroid called Bennu. Over the summer, another spacecraft, Hayabusa-2, scooped up samples from the asteroid 162173 Ryugu. Hayabusa-2’s samples are now on their way back to Earth, and towards the end of 2020, scientists at JAXA, the Japanese space agency, will have their own nerve-wracking moment when they attempt to retrieve them.
Perhaps the most intriguing development in this field came in October 2017 with the unexpected arrival of a small, irregularly-shaped object known as ‘Oumuamua. Initially designated as a comet, and later reclassed as an asteroid, ‘Oumuamua is now thought to be neither. Instead, it is an interstellar visitor – the name ‘Oumuamua means “scout” in Hawaiian – and its exact composition is a matter of much scientific debate (as well as endless science-fiction-driven speculation). A craft like Philae or Hayabusa could answer those questions, and a group of scientists at a non-profit organization, the Institute for Interstellar Studies (IIS), has duly proposed a rendezvous mission to ‘Oumuamua.
Most space missions take a while to get off the ground, and with ‘Oumuamua already on its way out of the solar system, the odds seem stacked against the IIS scientists. But other, similar missions are also under development. One of them, ESA’s Comet Interceptor, is designed to visit a comet or interstellar visitor that hasn’t even been discovered yet. According to Geraint Jones, a planetary scientist at University College London and co-leader of the team that proposed the mission, the idea is to place the spacecraft in a dynamically-stable location (the L2 Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system), wait until a suitable object comes along, then send the craft to investigate it. Something like ‘Oumuamua would be ideal, but a long-period comet full of relatively pristine “leftovers” from when the planets formed would also tell us much about the early history of our solar system.
The launch date for Comet Interceptor isn’t until 2028, so it’ll be a while before we can enjoy a sequel to the comet-exploring achievements of 2014. As Philae and the Rosetta mission showed, though, some things are worth the wait.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scientists find a simple solution for making ferroelectric nylon thin films</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An efficient way of making ferroelectric nylon has been developed by Saleem Anwar and collaborators at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany. The technique provides a starting point for the cost-efficient production of ferroelectric nylon thin films using commercially-available materials. Such films could find a wide range of applications including robotics, biomedical devices and energy harvesting.
We are all familiar with nylon as a synthetic material used for clothing, but some types of nylon have much more sophisticated applications. Nylon is composed of repeating aliphatic units connected by amides. Aliphatic compounds are open-chain materials formed by carbon and hydrogen atoms, such as methane and ethylene.
Nylon is characterized by the number of carbon atoms in the repeating aliphatic units. When this number is odd, nylon can be ferroelectric with spontaneous electric polarization. This type of nylon can therefore be used to make capacitors. Together with their mechanical properties, ferroelectricity makes odd nylons ideal candidates for a range of applications.
According to the team it is a challenge to “construct smooth, optically transparent, pinhole-free solution processed odd-nylon films that are crystallized in the ferroelectric phase”.
The team turned to solution processing, which is a low-cost technique that can be performed at room temperature. Nylons are insoluble in most common solvents, so the first step in the solution processing of nylons is to find the right solvent. Anwar and colleagues found that a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and acetone has the right properties to be used in solution processing of low number odd nylon thin films.
Nylons can solidify in different crystalline phases, and ferroelectricity occurs in only one of these possible phases. This is a phase in which the unorganized hydrogen-bonded chain structure enables the polarization of the compound. Before this study this ferroelectric phase of odd nylon had never been created by solution processing at room temperature.
The thin films of nylon are made by spin-coating the solution on a glass substrate. The samples are then placed in high vacuum for solution quenching, which freezes the components in the unorganized phase and removes the remaining solvent.
The authors compared the performance of a nylon-11 ferroelectric capacitor with a capacitor made of conventional ferroelectric polymers. The test focused on the ability of the capacitor to retain the polarized state when it is subjected to continuous stress cycles. The nylon-11 capacitor outperformed the conventional one during a million stress cycles.
The technique is described in Science Advances.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molecular graphenoids make coherent spin centres</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Quantum dots made of molecular graphene containing pentagon-shaped defects could form the basis of a new generation of quantum sensors. This is the finding of researchers in the UK and Germany who made the dots, or “graphenoids”, using a bottom-up chemical process rather than the top-down methods usually employed to create such nanostructures. The researchers say that such graphenoids could be employed in carbon-based devices that exploit quantum-mechanical effects to sense their environment.
Quantum technologies rely on manipulating the quantum properties of charges, spins or photons. Quantum spins in material defects such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are a popular platform for this work, but defects in other carbon materials – including graphene, a one-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice – also show promise.
Researchers have explored various ways of introducing spin defects into carbon nanomaterials, including encasing heteroatoms inside fullerenes, confining electrons in carbon nanotubes and functionalizing carbon nanoribbons. However, whereas the position of NV centres can be controlled with atomic precision, it has proved more difficult to control the locations of other carbon-based point defects. Indeed, researchers only managed to do so quite recently by introducing organic molecules with heptagonal ring structures at specific positions into graphene.
A team of researchers led by Lapo Bogani at Oxford University in the UK have built on this work by introducing a saddle-shaped organic molecule into the hexagonal lattice of graphene. They chose this molecule – a “radicaloid” known as diindeno-fused bischrysen – because it incompletely hydrogenates in the final processing step, producing open-pentagonal-shell monoradical species that can act as defects.
In the past, graphene nanoribbons and other defect-bearing structures could only be obtained by starting with an advanced structure and modifying it, for example by making carbon nanotubes and then unzipping them. These top-down techniques invariably produced structures with undefined edges and uncontrollable defects, Bogani explains. In contrast, he and his team synthesized their diindeno-fused bischrysen from 11,11′- dibromo-5,5′-bichrysene in a five-step bottom-up chemical process that starts with small molecular precursors and builds up the final molecule.
The researchers checked every stage of this process with high-precision chemical characterization techniques, including mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This enabled them to accurately determine the position of the pentagonal defects in the honeycomb lattice of graphene.
The researchers report that when they put the spins of the resulting defects into a quantum superposition, the superposition remained coherent for up to 100 µs. Long coherence times are of paramount importance for quantum operations, and Bogani says that the robustness of the superposition in their system is due to low quantum noise from the nuclear spins in the molecule, as well as a low intrinsic spin-orbit coupling since the only elements in the structure are carbon and hydrogen.
The team, which includes researchers from Technische Universität Dresden and the Max Planck Institut für Polymerforschung, say that they will now be probing the quantum properties of their defects at room temperature by introducing the organic molecule they synthesized into matrices of solid systems such as liquid crystals or porous metal-organic frameworks. According to Bogani, possible applications include spintronics and optoelectronics devices as well as biological sensors.
“Our work straddles both quantum physics and synthetic chemistry and it paves the way to quantum manipulation of magnetic graphene-based structures in the future,” he tells Physics World.
Full details of the research are reported in Science Advances.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Photographer Liz Carlson has shot coloured glaciers at Mount Aspiring National Park on New Zealand's South Island, Science Alert reported.
“Our glaciers don’t need any more battles as they are already truly endangered,” Carlson wrote on her blog. “It puts the impact of climate change into even more stark reality we can’t ignore.”
For now, it is unknown what caused the red colour of the glaciers. According to meteorologist Chris Brandolino, it could be soot or a carbon material from burnt wood. However, it could also just be red dust blown over from Australia, a phenomenon that's been observed before. Australian topsoil is rich in iron oxides, giving it its characteristic red hue. 
In addition to the catastrophic fires on Australia's east coast, has also seen strong dust storms. Last month in Mildura, Victoria, a storm turned the sky red and the temperatures reached 40 degrees Celsius.
Whether the red cover of the pristine New Zealand mountains is dust, soot or anything else, Brandolino explained that several factors need to be combined to allow it to cross the Tasmanian Sea.
"You need to have smoke or dust in the air to begin with, and you have to have the right wind direction, and I think, having two happening at the same time, that's what's led [to this]”, he said.
"The fact that Australia had ... numerous fires out there, I think that's certainly been a part of it."
The photos also show how interconnected the ecosystems of our planet are. Pollution can even reach the most remote places.

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Squeezing Spacetime” –LIGO Researchers End-Run Nature to Detect Gravitational Waves</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intrepid researchers at MIT and Caltech have done what was thought impossible: an end run around nature. They have finessed spooky quantum vacuum –the ground state of energy for the Universe and the source of all potentiality– without violating the laws of nature that will allow the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) to detect ghostly signals, the whispers of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime at the quantum level, with weekly frequency.
“It tells us that we can do an end-run around nature sometimes. Not always, but sometimes,” said Nergis Mavalvala, the Marble Professor of Astrophysics and associate head of the Department of Physics at MIT.
Just a year ago, the National Science Foundation-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), was picking up whispers of gravitational waves every month or so. Now, a new addition to the system is enabling the instruments to detect these ripples in space-time nearly every week, reports MIT.
Since the start of LIGO’s third operating run in April, a new instrument known as a quantum vacuum squeezer has helped scientists pick out dozens of gravitational wave signals, including one that appears to have been generated by a binary neutron star — the explosive merging of two neutron stars.
The squeezer (shown below), as scientists call it, was designed, built, and integrated with LIGO’s detectors by MIT researchers, along with collaborators from Caltech and the Australian National University, who detail its workings in a paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters.
What the instrument “squeezes” is quantum noise — infinitesimally small fluctuations in the vacuum of space that make it into the detectors. The signals that LIGO detects are so tiny that these quantum, otherwise minor fluctuations can have a contaminating effect, potentially muddying or completely masking incoming signals of gravitational waves.
“Where quantum mechanics comes in relates to the fact that LIGO’s laser is made of photons,” explains lead author Maggie Tse, a graduate student at MIT. “Instead of a continuous stream of laser light, if you look close enough it’s actually a noisy parade of individual photons, each under the influence of vacuum fluctuations. Whereas a continuous stream of light would create a constant hum in the detector, the individual photons each arrive at the detector with a little ‘pop.'”
“This quantum noise is like a popcorn crackle in the background that creeps into our interferometer, and is very difficult to measure,” adds Mavalvala.
With the new squeezer technology, LIGO has shaved down this confounding quantum crackle, extending the detectors’ range by 15 percent. Combined with an increase in LIGO’s laser power, this means the detectors can pick out a gravitational wave generated by a source in the universe out to about 140 megaparsecs, or more than 400 million light years away. This extended range has enabled LIGO to detect gravitational waves on an almost weekly basis.
“When the rate of detection goes up, not only do we understand more about the sources we know, because we have more to study, but our potential for discovering unknown things comes in,” says Mavalvala, a longtime member of the LIGO scientific team. “We’re casting a broader net.”
The new paper’s lead authors are graduate students Maggie Tse and Haocun Yu, and Lisa Barsotti, a principal research scientist at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, along with others in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.
Quantum limit
LIGO comprises two identical detectors, one located at Hanford, Washington, and the other at Livingston, Louisiana. Each detector consists of two 4-kilometer-long tunnels, or arms, each extending out from the other in the shape of an “L.”
To detect a gravitational wave, scientists send a laser beam from the corner of the L-shaped detector, down each arm, at the end of which is suspended a mirror. Each laser bounces off its respective mirror and travels back down each arm to where it started. If a gravitational wave passes through the detector, it should shift one or both of the mirrors’ position, which would in turn affect the timing of each laser’s arrival back at its origin. This timing is something scientists can measure to identify a gravitational wave signal.
The main source of uncertainty in LIGO’s measurements comes from quantum noise in a laser’s surrounding vacuum. While a vacuum is typically thought of as a nothingness, or emptiness in space, physicists understand it as a state in which subatomic particles (in this case, photons) are being constantly created and destroyed, appearing then disappearing so quickly they are extremely difficult to detect. Both the time of arrival (phase) and number (amplitude) of these photons are equally unknown, and equally uncertain, making it difficult for scientists to pick out gravitational-wave signals from the resulting background of quantum noise.
And yet, this quantum crackle is constant, and as LIGO seeks to detect farther, fainter signals, this quantum noise has become more of a limiting factor.
“The measurement we’re making is so sensitive that the quantum vacuum matters,” Barsotti notes.
Putting the squeeze on “spooky” noise
The research team at MIT began over 15 years ago to design a device to squeeze down the uncertainty in quantum noise, to reveal fainter and more distant gravitational wave signals that would otherwise be buried the quantum noise.
Quantum squeezing was a theory that was first proposed in the 1980s, the general idea being that quantum vacuum noise can be represented as a sphere of uncertainty along two main axes: phase and amplitude. If this sphere were squeezed, like a stress ball, in a way that constricted the sphere along the amplitude axis, this would in effect shrink the uncertainty in the amplitude state of a vacuum (the squeezed part of the stress ball), while increasing the uncertainty in the phase state (stress ball’s displaced, distended portion). Since it is predominantly the phase uncertainty that contributes noise to LIGO, shrinking it could make the detector more sensitive to astrophysical signals.
When the theory was first proposed nearly 40 years ago, a handful of research groups tried to build quantum squeezing instruments in the lab.
“After these first demonstrations, it went quiet,” Mavalvala says.
“The challenge with building squeezers is that the squeezed vacuum state is very fragile and delicate,” Tse adds. “Getting the squeezed ball, in one piece, from where it is generated to where it is measured is surprisingly hard. Any misstep, and the ball can bounce right back to its unsqueezed state.”
Then, around 2002, just as LIGO’s detectors first started searching for gravitational waves, researchers at MIT began thinking about quantum squeezing as a way to reduce the noise that could possibly mask an incredibly faint gravitational wave signal. They developed a preliminary design for a vacuum squeezer, which they tested in 2010 at LIGO’s Hanford site. The result was encouraging: The instrument managed to boost LIGO’s signal-to-noise ratio — the strength of a promising signal versus the background noise.
Since then, the team, led by Tse and Barsotti, has refined its design, and built and integrated squeezers into both LIGO detectors. The heart of the squeezer is an optical parametric oscillator, or OPO — a bowtie-shaped device that holds a small crystal within a configuration of mirrors. When the researchers direct a laser beam to the crystal, the crystal’s atoms facilitate interactions between the laser and the quantum vacuum in a way that rearranges their properties of phase versus amplitude, creating a new, “squeezed” vacuum that then continues down each of the detector’s arm as it normally would. This squeezed vacuum has smaller phase fluctuations than an ordinary vacuum, allowing scientists to better detect gravitational waves.
In addition to increasing LIGO’s ability to detect gravitational waves, the new quantum squeezer may also help scientists better extract information about the sources that produce these waves.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why do smells trigger such vivid memories?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The smell of a newly mowed lawn may take back to your childhood days tumbling in the backyard. Maybe catching a whiff of a certain perfume instantly reminds you of your mom.
Why do smells have the power to trigger such strong memories? The answer is in your brain.
The amygdala is the structure in the brain's temporal lobe that plays an important role in processing emotions. It sits right near the hippocampus, which is responsible for learning and forming memories, according to the University of Queensland Brain Institute. Both elements are part of the brain's limbic system, which also includes the thalamus, the brain's communication or relay station.
Normally, when you hear, see, touch or taste something, that information goes to the thalamus. It then sends it to the important areas in the brain, including the amygdala and hippocampus.
But it's a whole different ballgame with smells. They skip the thalamus and head right to the olfactory bulb, which helps the brain process odors. The olfactory bulb is directly connected to the amygdala and hippocampus, Curiosity points out.
This immediate link might explain why a smell can instantly trigger a vivid memory. Although humans are so visually oriented, it's interesting that smells would have such an impact in the brain.
"Some think it goes back to the way we evolved: Smell is one of the most rudimentary senses with roots in the way single-celled organisms interact with the chemicals around them, so it has the longest evolutionary history," writes Curiosity's Ashley Hamer. "This also might explain why we have at least 1,000 different types of smell receptors but only four types of light sensors and about four types of receptors for touch."
Interestingly, sometimes a smell will trigger strong emotions, but you may not actually recall the memory behind those feelings.
Sometimes the memory behind the emotional response never resurfaces. You just feel the feelings of whatever happened, but don't remember what you experienced, Rachel Herz, an adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University in Rhode Island, tells LiveScience.
This is sometimes due to lack of context.
If you smell a long-lost scent when you're walking down the street and it's something you used to smell in your home growing up, for example, it will be difficult to place because you're experiencing it in a different situation. You'll still feel an emotional rush, but you might not have the associated memories.
The brain uses the context "to give meaning to the information" and find that memory, Herz explains.
Researchers have found that smells invoke more memories than the words that describe those smells. For example, the scent of a freshly baked apple pie might immediately zip you back to your grandmother's kitchen. But just hearing someone say "apple pie," might not give you the same trip down memory lane.
In one study published in the journal Neuropsychologia, researchers found that memories triggered by a scent resulted in much more activity in the brain's limbic system than memories accompanied by just a word without any accompanying smell. So, for example, people responded much more emphatically when they smelled a rose than when they just heard the word "rose."
Merely hearing the word didn't conjure up the emotional response and memories as the immediate visceral reaction triggered by the scent.
"Smells do bring back memories," Dr. Ken Heilman, professor of neurology and health psychology at the University of Florida, tells NBC News. "Smell goes into the emotional parts of the brain and the memory parts, whereas words go into thinking parts of the brain."

A panel of scientists and public health experts gathered by the World Health Organization (WHO) met to discuss the top emerging pathogens most likely to cause severe outbreaks in the near future. These are viruses for which there is no vaccine and few, if any, treatments.
Here's a look at these diseases and what makes them so frightening.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dangers of 'Superbug' Germs Greater Than Believed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONDAY, Dec. 9, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- The risk of new superbugs that pose a threat to human health and food crops is much higher than previously thought, new genetic research shows.
There's been an uptick in the number of laboratory studies showing how just one mutation could create highly infectious or "hypervirulent" strains of disease-causing bacteria, fungi and water molds.
These include microbes that cause human diseases such as tuberculosis and salmonellosis, as well as diseases of fruit, vegetables and cereals, according to the team that manages the world's only specialist database on the disease-causing genes of microbes.
The number of hypervirulence genes catalogued rose from 112 in 2015 to a current total of 475, according to scientists from Rothamsted Research in the U.K.
Hypervirulence now accounts for almost 5% of database entries and is especially common in bacteria, according to the report published recently in the journal Nucleic Acids Research.
"The increasing number of hypervirulent interactions indicates that scientists have identified many new factors occurring during infection. These genes need close monitoring if we are to halt the emergence and spread of severe disease outbreaks," geneticist Kim Hammond-Kosack, who oversees the database, said in a news release.
The report's authors attributed the rising number of hypervirulence genes partly to faster, cheaper genetic testing, which enables scientists to study more genes and diseases in greater detail.
Other factors include climate change, human migration and the global trade of fresh goods.
"In addition, we have the emergence of many new disease-causing organisms, we have diseases jumping species barriers into new hosts, and we have a growing resistance to antibiotics and pesticides -- coupled with a rise in legislation banning or restricting many existing chemicals we use for control -- all of which means microbial infections are of ever growing concern to human, animal and plant welfare," Hammond-Kosack said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Don't worry too much about the bald patch of land on your garden lawn — they may be a crucial part of its success in the spring. 
That’s according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which says gardeners should embrace sparse patches in lawns and flower beds to support invertebrates, including spiders.  
The society's study found ground-dwelling spiders in greater numbers among sparser garden plantings, which are a crucial part of a garden's ecosystem.  
Despite their reputation as mean and scary, spiders are a valuable part of a garden’s ecosystem, and help out gardeners by devouring vegetation-eating pests. 
 Invertebrates are animals that do not possess develop a backbone, known as a vertebral column.
More than 90 percent of all living animal species are invertebrates.
Examples of common invertebrates are snails, sponges, earthworms, squids, sea-stars, centipedes, butterflies, spiders, and jellyfish.
They are generally soft-bodied animals that lack a rigid internal skeleton for the attachment of muscles but often possess a hard outer skeleton.

RHS researchers from the society’s Garden Wisley in Surrey looked at the needs of ground-dwelling invertebrates in gardens as part of a four-year study. 
According to Dr Andrew Salisbury, principal entomologist at the RHS, said ‘the power of a garden lies in its very smallest inhabitants’.
‘Ground-dwelling invertebrates such as predatory ground beetles and ground-active spiders are vital garden predators whilst springtails, woodlice and millipedes break down dead plant matter returning nutrients to the soil.
Spiders are important predators, feeding on prey including biting midges and spa-sucking insects. 
‘Gardeners who look after them will have the greatest positive impact for biodiversity,' Dr Salisbury said. 
The RHS also found that overall the denser the vegetation, the more ground-active invertebrates, but that the odd patch of bald growth is positive for ground-dwelling spiders.  
The RHS said that the best way to support invertebrates in gardens is to choose plantings biased towards British native plants and encourage dense vegetation, but crucially to leave some patches bare. 
Planting smaller, younger plants and letting them fill out and embracing the occasional bald patch is not only economical but provides a different habitat. 
Near-native and exotic plants also have a positive role to play in providing a habitat for invertebrates, offering good evergreen winter cover and supporting pollinators when in flower.
Evergreen plants such as holly, Christmas box and pittosporum might have a special role to play for invertebrates, the RHS said, including ladybirds, springtails and ground beetles, by providing shelter in the winter months. 
The charity has outlined five steps to support garden invertebrates, including leaving some bare patches in lawns and flower beds, planting evergreens and both native and near-native plants, and being 'bio-diverse' by not limiting the variety of species they plant. 
The research has been published as the third paper from the RHS’s four-year Plants for Bugs study — which is looking into the garden plant origin preferences of invertebrates — in the journal Biodiversity and Conservation.
The RHS, the UK's leading gardening charity, is fundraising £40 million to transform its facilities, including redeveloping Garden Wisley and opening a new garden, RHS Garden Bridgewater, in 2020.
As well as being open to the public, the charity's gardens provide important ecological study for its scientists. 
 To support invertebrates in gardens the RHS advises:
The perfect cover: Let planting fill out, but keep some areas sparser to help specific groups notably spiders. Although not covered in this research, some ground-nesting bees also make use of patches of bare ground.
More local: Plant densely with plenty of native and near-native plants to support the greatest number of ground-active invertebrates but be prepared for more nibbled plants than exotic plant schemes.
Winter protection: Whatever the plant origin, try to include some evergreens in your garden to give shelter to invertebrates.
Decide priorities: Choosing more exotics in your planting scheme might mean it supports marginally fewer plant-dwelling and ground-active herbivores, but will mean potentially fewer nibbled plants and should help extend the season for pollinators if you choose flowering exotics.
Be bio-diverse: For rich species diversity, follow all of the above. Don’t limit yourself to just a few different plants — this and other studies suggest the greater the variety of plants in a garden, the richer the diversity of invertebrates it will support.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Weatherman Issues Update on Cyclone Belna</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kenya’s Meteorological Department issued a statement on  Monday, December 9, dismissing claims that cyclone Belna would hit Kenya.
In a statement sent to newsrooms, the weatherman admitted that despite the cyclone influencing the current extreme weather patterns, it was impossible for it to make landfall in the Kenyan Coast, according to the laws of physics.
"Tropical cyclones do not form within  5  degrees north and  5 degrees south of the  Equator.  Therefore,  cyclone  Belna cannot hit Kenya but will strongly impact the weather conditions," read a section of the statement.
The meteorological department added that Kenyans should brace themselves for the adverse effects of the cyclone through heavy rainfall in the Southern parts of the country.
"Belna is currently influencing the weather over Kenya indirectly, by creating favorable conditions for heavy rainfall in the Southern parts of  Kenya," the document further disclosed.
However, the government was quick to reiterate the fact that the news being spread around social media regarding an impeding cyclone was actually false.
"Contrary to information being spread on social media, the cyclone Belna is NOT headed for the Kenyan Coast. It is moving southwards towards north-western Madagascar."
Going on to provide a satellite image confirming that the cyclone was indeed headed towards the island nation.  
According to the United States’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a tropical cyclone is a rotating, organised system of clouds and thunderstorms that originates over tropical or subtropical waters and has closed, low-level circulation.
Cyclones occur in areas where there is low pressure. For a cyclone to form, a large and still warm ocean area with a temperature above 26.5°C is required, where a body of warm air forms just above the ocean’s surface. 
As this air warms, it expands, becomes lighter and rises, leading to a sustained low-pressure area. Low altitude winds blow in to replace this air that has risen. This air is warmed and also rises.
The rising air contains large amounts of water that has evaporated from the ocean’s surface. As it rises, it cools, condensing to form huge clouds. These clouds eventually become very thick and heavy.
Condensation then releases the latent heat energy stored in the water vapour, providing the cyclone with more power. This forms a self-sustaining heat cycle. 
The force created by the earth’s rotation on a tilted axis, known as the Coriolis effect, causes rising currents of air to spiral around the centre of the tropical cyclone. These currents blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
Because the earth’s Coriolis force is zero at the equator, air tends to flow straight into centres, so any areas of low pressure will dissipate before a self-sustaining heat cycle can form.
However, it's important to note that 17 tropical cyclones have occurred within 3°N and 3°S of the equator, and 3 of them have happened in the Indian Ocean. The one that came closest to Kenya is Cyclone Agni which occurred in late 2004 in the North Indian Ocean, affecting the coast of Somalia.
Notably as well is the fact that global warming has had a sizeable effect on the magnitude of recent cyclones across the world.
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council of the United States, over the past 50-plus years, the earth’s oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat generated by global warming, becoming warmer as a result, which in turn has acted as more fuel for devastating hurricanes.
Category 1 cyclones have sustained winds of at least 119 km/h. The highest classification in the scale, Category 5, consists of storms with sustained winds over 251 km/h.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Advertisement
Could penguins be any cuter? I mean, c'mon. Whether the Little Blue penguins of New Zealand – the world's smallest with an average height of 12 inches (33 centimeters) – or the Emperor penguins found marching around Antarctica (average height 44 inches or 112 centimeters), they're universally adored. Decked out in their tuxedo-like feathers, they can't fly but they zip around on their bellies in the snow and swim like Michael Phelps competing for another gold medal. Jenn O'Dell, a curator of mammals and birds at the Georgia Aquarium and part of the team that cares the aquarium's flock of African penguins, let us in on a few more fun facts about this beloved bird.
There are up to 26 different species of penguins. In the wild, they all live in the Southern Hemisphere on four continents – Africa, South America, Australia/New Zealand and Antarctica, typically places where the water is very cold. There is an exception. The endangered Galapagos penguin lives in the Galapagos archipelago which is right on the equator.
African penguins have incredibly small feathers and there are lots of them – about 8,200 feathers per square inch! That number will vary according to penguin species and size.
"Their feathers act like a barrier to the water they're swimming in," says O'Dell. "The feathers are important to their survival because they're swimming in really cold water. If they didn't have that barrier they wouldn't survive."
In addition to the density of the feathers, penguins also use oil from a uropygial gland, sometimes called a preen gland, located at the base of their tail, to preen or waterproof their feathers. "When they're swimming in the ocean, no water ever touches their skin," says O'Dell.
Most penguins will breed monogamously for life and return to the same breeding place. However, O'Dell says she and other researchers have seen mated pairs split up and form new pairs for no discernable reason. African penguins breed year-round with peak times in November and March. They typically lay two eggs which are incubated for about 40 days. Males and females are both engaged in incubating, tending and feeding the chicks after they hatch.
Most penguins do not balance the eggs on the tops of their feet while incubating their eggs, as seen in the movie "The March of the Penguins." That's something done primarily by Emperor penguins because of the brutal Antarctic cold. Other penguin species may build a burrow or scrape together nesting material – rocks, mud, sticks or grasses – where they lay their eggs.
Imagine having to go through an annual life cycle where you double your weight, lose all the hair on your body and then grow new hair. That's what penguins do every year.
"The catastrophic molt is a two-and-a-half-week process during which they lose all their feathers and grow new ones back," says O'Dell. "It's a natural thing they go through but it is physiologically stressful. In advance of molting, they will come close to doubling their body weight because they won't swim or hunt. That way, during that time when they're losing the feathers and growing them back, they've got enough reserves to get them through."
O'Dell says molting typically happens around the same season each year for African penguins, with some outliers. "You can probably find a molting penguin at any time of the year," she says, "But the majority will molt with the rest of the flock."
Handlers at the Georgia Aquarium occasionally wanted their African penguins to take part in educational or interactive programs but they weren't sure how well they would take to instruction. Turns out penguins are pretty smart cookies. "When we started incorporating a more formalized training program with them, they learned incredibly fast," says O'Dell. "Like most animals they are responsive to operant conditioning and positive reinforcement. The way they respond to people has a lot to do with their history, where they came from, their interaction here and the training process." O'Dell says that like other animals, including many species of birds, penguins can form strong attachments to specific trainers.
With so many penguin species, the conservation status runs the gamut from those that are of "least concern" like the Adelie and the "vulnerable" Macaroni which live and breed in Antarctic waters, to "endangered" Northern Rockhopper penguins, found in the more temperate South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.
African penguins are also endangered on the IUCN Red List. "Their numbers have decreased 90 percent over the last 100 years," says O'Dell. "There are only 16,000 breeding pairs left. There's speculation that this species of penguin could be extinct within our lifetime, possibly in the next 15 to 20 years without significant changes."
The problems are mostly man-made. In addition to competing with humans for the same fish, O'Dell says their prey has also moved. "The penguins have to swim farther to get food and by the time they get back to their chicks, they've digested everything," she says. "They don't have anything to feed their young."
"Georgia Aquarium has committed to the species in a lot of different ways. There are people from our team, from vet services, who support the South African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) to help with rescue, rehab and release of African penguins and other seabird species, and fund research projects to get the African penguin population growing in the right direction again."
Penguins spend most of their lives in the water because that's where they find their food. The only time they're on land is when they're molting or breeding and raising their young. A group of penguins in the water is called a 'raft,' while a group of penguins on land is called a 'waddle.' Some other collective nouns for penguins include 'rookery,' 'colony' and 'huddle.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Busted transport system unites neurodegenerative diseases</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers may have found a likely culprit behind the protein clumps in the brain that unite all neurodegenerative diseases.
All neurodegenerative diseases have a common thread: the appearance of protein clumps in the brain such as amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer’s disease and alpha synuclein aggregates in Parkinson’s.
In a pair of studies carried out in flies and mice, the researchers discovered that the issue lies in the system that transports proteasomes, the molecular machinery that breaks down proteins, to specific locations within a cell.
“This is the first study to find a mechanism by which the proteasomes are moved to nerve endings to do their job,” says Hermann Steller, a professor at Rockefeller University. “When this mechanism gets disrupted, there are severe consequences for the function and long-term survival of nerve cells.”
Proteasomes are made in the cell body of a neuron and need to be transported over long distances to reach the nerve endings where the neuron connects with other cells—a journey of more than one meter in some cases. When proteasomes fail to reach these critical communication hubs, the cell descends into turmoil.
“Instead of being degraded, damaged proteins in these sites hang around long enough to interact with other binding partners, form aggregates, and disrupt cell function,” Steller says. Over time, this causes degeneration of nerve fibers and ultimately cell death.
When Steller and his team began investigating the proteasome transportation system in fruit flies, they identified a protein called PI31, which plays a crucial role in loading the proteasomes onto the cellular components that ferry them around. In research in Developmental Cell, they show that PI31 enhances binding and promotes movement of proteasomes with cellular motors. Without it, transport is halted. This is the case in both fly and mouse neurons, suggesting that the transport mechanism is common between many species.
Digging deeper into what happens when PI31 is defective, the scientists worked with Mary Beth Hatten’s lab to generate mice whose PI31 gene was switched off in two groups of brain cells with particularly long extensions. In research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they found that without PI31, proteasomes cannot travel, resulting in abnormal proteins levels at the tips of neuronal branches. The PI31-lacking neurons also looked peculiar, both with respect to their branches and to their synapses, the structures where branches from two neurons connect.
“Notably, these structural changes became progressively more severe with age,” says Steller. “Inactivation of PI31 in these neurons was reminiscent of the severe behavioral and anatomical defects we see in some human neurogenerative disease.”
There are other reasons to suspect that the lab’s findings could inform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, mutations in a human gene called PARK15, which is critical for PI31 activity, have been identified in a severe form of early-onset Parkinson’s disease; and mutations in the PI31 gene itself have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.
Steller and his team are now working to determine if PI31, or molecules that affect its activity, are viable drug targets. The fact that PI31 appears to be involved in the early stages of nerve cell degeneration is especially compelling, as it could mean that drugs blocking this protein might have the potential to halt brain damage early on in the process.
As for what actually causes brains to degenerate, Steller believes the formation of aggregates is likely not the direct disease mechanism, but rather a symptom of bigger problems.
“Our work suggests that it really starts with a local defect in proteasomes, resulting in the failure to degrade proteins that are critical for nerve function” he says. “These undigested proteins subsequently form aggregates and activate additional damage control pathways. But eventually, these clearance systems are overwhelmed, which causes a slow but steady progression to a detectable disease.”
Steller and his colleagues are now investigating ways to stimulate the transportation pathway to get proteasomes out to the distal branches—work they believe could have a broad impact on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global warming is robbing world’s oceans of oxygen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The amount of oxygen in the world’s oceans decreased by 2 percent between 1960 and 2010 and is expected to go down by a further 3-4 percent by the year 2100 as a result of global warming, something that will have an effect on habitats and the coastal economies that depend on them.
This situation was outlined in a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – “Ocean deoxygenation: Everyone’s problem” – presented Saturday at the United Nations climate change summit in Madrid.
According to the study, this loss of oxygen is closely linked to the warming of the planet and the acidification of the oceans caused by an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) as a result of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the so-called fertilization of the oceans.
Most of the excess heat retained by the Earth is absorbed by the oceans, which inhibits the diffusion of oxygen from the surface to the depths, and the increase in nutrients that arrive via rivers leads to the proliferation of algae and an increase in the demand for oxygen, said Dan Laffoley of the IUCN Marine Science and Conservation program.
The study identified over 900 coastal areas and semi-enclosed seas around the world that are subject to the effects of eutrophication – the excessive enrichment of the water with nutrients or organic matter.
More than 700 of these areas have hypoxia problems (a lack of oxygen) compared to 45 of them back in the 1960s.
And the volume of water that has been completely depleted of oxygen has quadrupled, according to the report.
The researchers point out that eutrophication-induced hypoxia can be reversed if certain measures are taken, but hypoxia caused by global warming is more difficult to combat.
They are therefore calling for a “drastic effort” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce the rate of oxygen reduction in the oceans, a new global problem that remains relatively unknown, according to professor Lisa Levin from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
Beyond the damage caused by overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction and plastic, there is no environmental variable of such ecological importance to marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period of time owing to human activities as that of dissolved oxygen, said John Baxter, an expert in Protected Areas of the IUCN.
According to Baxter, although the causes are known, no attention is being paid to the consequences that this will have in the long term for human health, the economy and society.
It will entail the loss of biodiversity, changes in the distribution of species, the displacement or reduction of fishery resources as well as changes in biogeochemical cycles.
The report highlights oceans as a source of oxygen for the atmosphere and the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea as the largest semi-closed marine ecosystems whose oxygen content is low.
But the repercussions of deoxygenation are not limited to closed or semi-enclosed seas – areas with limited oxygen content have also expanded in much of the Atlantic in the last 50-100 years, even in connected seas like the Mediterranean.
And besides affecting coastal areas, the lack of oxygen is also seen at medium depths between 300-1,000 meters – the richest in biodiversity -, as in the Atlantic basin, which has witnessed a significant reduction in the last 60 years.
The report pointed to the need to reduce waste from agriculture, industry, wastewater and to avoid other sources of stress for the world’s oceans such as pollution and overfishing.
For Levin, there are solutions but there needs to be greater ambition when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions – an objective that is in the hands of governments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Study reveals how Diabetes drug promotes healthy aging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington - Doctors commonly prescribe metformin to help people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar levels. The drug increases insulin sensitivity through its effects on glucose metabolism.
Metformin may hold surprising benefits in the fight against age-related illness.
However, although there is clear evidence of metformins effectiveness, scientists do not fully understand how it interacts with cells and tissues at the molecular level.
Using cell cultures and mice, the researchers identified numerous biochemical switches for turning various cell and molecular processes on and off.
The findings shed light not only on metformins mechanism of glucose control, but also on a surprising number of other reactions and pathways.
Large-scale clinical trials of metformin are already under way to test the drugs effectiveness in extending life span and health span that is, the proportion of a persons life span that they spend in good health.
However, the underlying biochemistry has been unclear.
Teams from three research centers worked on the study: the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Scripps Research Institute both in La Jolla, CA and Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.
"These results," says Reuben J. Shaw, one of the studys corresponding authors, "provide us with new avenues to explore in order to understand how metformin works as a diabetes drug, along with its health-span-extending effects."
"These are pathways that neither we, nor anyone else, would have imagined," he adds.
Shaw is a professor of molecular and cell biology at the Salk Institute and director of the Salk Cancer Center.
More recently, scientists have found that metformin may be effective in a number of other conditions, including obesity, cancer, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Other recent research has also suggested that metformin may have anti-aging effects Trusted Source and an ability to protect bone, especially during the early phases of rheumatoid arthriti

    <h5 class="mb-1">Probiotic food may have varying effects on infants</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The intake of beneficial microbes like yeast in the form of probiotic food supplements can have different effects on the immune systems of male and female piglets, according to a study that suggested the findings may also apply to human infants.
The researchers, including those from the University of Bristol in the UK, said piglets are valuable preclinical models for children in nutritional studies.
The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology, revealed that 28-day old piglets produced very different levels of immune cells, antibodies, and other immune-associated molecules depending on their sex.
They said around 70 percent of the immune system is in the gut where its development is driven during early life, largely by the resident gut bacteria, contradicting previous evidence that the difference in immunity begins during puberty.
The study also noted that dietary supplements boosting the functions of beneficial gut bacteria work differently in male and female piglets.
According to scientists, the effect of these nutritional interventions can be masked if males and females were looked at all together.
Citing an example, the researchers said, the prebiotic inulin significantly increased the number of cells responsible for controlling immune responses such as the regulatory T-cells, in male guts but not in female guts.
"Correct development of the immune system is essential in ensuring it responds appropriately to both harmful and harmless stimulation throughout life and this development, even during the first days of life, depends on your sex," said study co-author Marie Lewis from the University of Reading in the UK.
"Although we don't know why we know that young girls tend to produce a more protective immune response to vaccination than boys. But what we did not expect to find is that young girls also appear to have a more regulated immune environment in their intestinal tissues than boys," Lewis added.
The researchers said, currently, methods analyzing the effectiveness of dietary supplements on the immune system assume that the same thing happens in boys and girls.
They cautioned that this may not be the case, and that sex may be influencing data on the effectiveness of probiotics and prebiotics in infanthood.
"The work raises some really important questions about why this happens - is it because the levels of the different sex hormones make the immune systems different almost as a side effect, even at this age, or is it because the immune and reproductive systems need to be fundamentally linked during early development," said study co-author Mick Bailey from the University of Bristol.
The researchers said the findings point to the need for designing different treatments for immune disorders in girls and boys.
"Given the underlying differences in immune development we identified between boys and girls, taking sex into account could provide a simple means to improve the effectiveness of pharmaceutics and other therapies which act on the immune system," Lewis said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Migratory birds are shrinking as the world heats up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what appears to be a response to climate change, migratory birds in North America have been shrinking, report researchers.
Their wings have also gotten a bit longer over the past four decades.
The study involves a dataset of some 70,000 North American migratory birds from 52 species that died when they collided with buildings in Chicago.
Since 1978, Field Museum personnel and volunteers have retrieved dead birds that collided with Chicago buildings during spring and fall migrations. They take multiple body measurements of each specimen.
The research team analyzed this remarkably detailed dataset to look for trends in body size and shape. The biologists found that, from 1978 through 2016, body size decreased in all 52 species, with statistically significant declines in 49 species.
Over the same period, wing length increased significantly in 40 species. The findings appear in the journal Ecology Letters.
“We had good reason to expect that increasing temperatures would lead to reductions in body size, based on previous studies. The thing that was shocking was how consistent it was. I was incredibly surprised that all of these species are responding in such similar ways,” says study lead author Brian Weeks, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability.
The new study is the largest specimen-based analysis of body-size responses to recent warming, and it shows the most consistent large-scale responses for a diverse group of birds, Weeks says.
Several lines of evidence suggest a causal relationship between warming temperatures and the observed declines in avian body size, according to the researchers. The strongest evidence is that—embedded within the long-term trends of declining body size and increasing temperature—there are numerous short-term fluctuations in body size and temperature that appear to be synchronized.
“Periods of rapid warming are followed really closely by periods of decline in body size, and vice versa,” Weeks says. “Being able to show that kind of detail in a morphological study is unique to our paper, as far as I know, and it’s entirely due to the quality of the dataset that David Willard generated.”
Coauthor David E. Willard, the Field Museum ornithologist and collections manager emeritus, measured all 70,716 birds analyzed in the study.
“It’s really been a herculean effort on the part of Dave and others at the Field Museum, including coauthor Mary Hennen, to get such valuable data from birds that might otherwise have been discarded after they died from building collisions,” says senior author Benjamin Winger of the University of Michigan department of ecology and evolutionary biology and the Museum of Zoology. Weeks worked on the project as a postdoctoral researcher in Winger’s lab.
Within animal species, individuals tend to be smaller in warmer parts of their range, a pattern known as Bergmann’s rule. And while the possibility of body size reduction in response to present-day global warming has been suggested for decades, evidence supporting the idea remains mixed.
The uncertainty is likely due, in part, to the scarcity of datasets like the Field Museum trove.
For each bird, Willard measured the length of a lower leg bone called the tarsus, bill length, wing length, and body mass. In birds, tarsus length is considered the most precise single measure of within-species variation in body size.
The data analysis revealed that:
Studies of plant and animal response to climate change often focus on shifts in the geographical range of a species or the timing of events such as springtime flowering and migration. The consistency of the body-size declines reported in the new study suggests that such changes should be added to the list of challenges facing wildlife in a rapidly warming world, Weeks says.
“It’s clear that there’s a third component—changes in body size and shape—that’s probably going to interact with changes in range and changes in timing to determine how effectively a species can respond to climate change,” he says.
Long-distance bird migration is one of the most impressive feats in the animal kingdom. The extreme energetic demands of flying thousands of miles have shaped the morphology of migrating birds—their form and structure—for efficient flight.
The authors of the Ecology Letters paper suggest that the body-size reductions are a response to climate warming and that increased wing length may help offset the body-mass losses.
The researchers plan to test that idea in a follow-up project, which will again make use of the Field Museum dataset. They’ll also look further into the mechanism behind the body size and shape changes and whether they are the result of a process called developmental plasticity, the ability of an individual to modify its development in response to changing environmental conditions.
The birds analyzed in the study are small-bodied songbirds that breed north of Chicago in the summer and migrate through the region in high numbers. Several species of sparrow, warbler, and thrush make up the majority of the dataset, with thousands of individuals of each species documented as lethal collisions.
The observed changes in avian body size and shape are subtle—at most a couple grams’ difference in body mass and a few millimeters in wing length—and are not detectable with the naked eye. The Field Museum bird collision dataset highlights the value of natural history museum specimen collections, which help scientists understand how nature changes through time, the authors note.
“When we began collecting the data analyzed in this study, we were addressing a few simple questions about year-to-year and season-to-season variations in birds,” says Willard. “The phrase ‘climate change’ as a modern phenomenon was barely on the horizon. The results from this study highlight how essential long-term data sets are for identifying and analyzing trends caused by changes in our environment.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sea of Galilee is a must-see on any trip to Israel. It’s the shimmering jewel of the green, mountainous Galilee region in the north.
Technically this “sea” is a lake, fed by underground springs and by the Jordan River. Since biblical times, it’s variously been called Lake Kinneret, Lake Tiberias and Sea of Genneseret.
Whatever you call it, this body of water is special to Christians. Here, according to the Gospels, Jesus performed miracles and recruited four local fishermen as his first disciples.
The historic cities of Tiberias, Tabgha and Capernaum (Kfar Nahum) are on its shores. Several kibbutzim – including the very first one, Degania (“Cornflower”) – were established on its banks in modern times.
The Sea of Galilee is the only natural freshwater lake in Israel and the lowest freshwater lake in the world, at 209 meters below sea level.
Its circumference measures approximately 53 kilometers (33 miles). Its length is about 21 km (13 miles) and its width is 13 km (8 miles).
Although the Sea of Galilee is also Israel’s largest freshwater reservoir, these days the level is quite low, and it must be supplemented by Mediterranean desalination plants.
The cool Kinneret waters are surrounded by both sandy and rocky beaches, and many historic, natural, archeological, recreational and religious attractions that bring in visitors from all over the world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What crabs can tell us about brain ‘building blocks’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A crab’s nervous system could help scientists learn what causes single neurons in the human brain to become “out of whack,” which can contribute to the development of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.
Knowing exactly how a single neuron operates among the billions housed in the human brain could one day help scientists design innovative ways to prevent and treat these diseases, such as targeted therapies.
Researchers worked to validate a popular research method called RNA sequencing used to identify unknown neurons in the brain and sort them into various subtypes. Neurons are a basic element of all animal nervous systems, allowing scientists to draw comparisons in animal models like crabs when studying the human nervous system.
“There are billions of neurons in the human brain, yet we still don’t know how many distinct types there are,” says David Schulz, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Missouri. “We are finally at a technological point where we can ask the incredibly complex question—what are the brain’s building blocks?”
Schulz believes the answer to that question will drive everything we know about diseases in the brain for the next 50 to 100 years. However, in order to answer that question he says we must first know how neurons are different from one another, and how healthy neurons differ from diseased ones.
Using a crab’s nervous system as a model, the researchers compared and validated the results of previous human RNA sequencing methods. Since crabs have already identifiable subtypes of neurons, the researchers knew what they were looking for, so they were able to work backward from the published results and use the RNA sequencing method to validate those findings.
Schulz says what they found both surprised and reassured him.
“If you don’t know what you are looking for in the complex human brain, then early efforts using RNA sequencing are going to need some refinement before we can answer this fundamental question,” Schulz says. “This study is one of those refinements. Until we can understand each component, we can’t expect to take the brain apart and put it back together again in order to figure out how it works.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Something funky happens to metal melting point under pressure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Something unexpected happens to the melting point of metals under extremely high pressure, a new study suggests.
Generally speaking, a metal’s melting point tends to increase with pressure, says Axel van de Walle, a professor in the School of Engineering at Brown University who oversaw the new research. But there’s been growing evidence that in alkali metals (a group that includes sodium and lithium), the melting point actually starts to decrease above a certain critical pressure, a phenomenon called re-entrant melting.
The new research shows that re-entrant melting likely goes well beyond the alkali group.
“What we show in this paper is that re-entrant melting is actually a feature of many—and perhaps most—metallic elements,” van de Walle says. “These findings are surprising because a decrease in melting temperature with pressure implies that the liquid becomes denser than the solid. That’s a phenomenon that’s well known in the case of water, but hadn’t been predicted for dense metals.”
For the study, which appears in Physical Review B, the researchers used quantum mechanical computational methods to simulate the behavior of atoms in a metal at various temperatures and pressures. The calculations showed that for alkali metals like sodium, re-entrant melting starts to happen at pressures around 30 gigapascals (about 300,000 times Earth’s atmospheric pressure).
But the research also showed, for the first time, that other metal could in theory undergo re-entrant melting at extreme pressures. Magnesium, for example, would undergo re-entrant melting at around 300 gigapascals. For aluminum, pressures around 3,500 gigapascals would induce re-entrant heating.
That even relatively dense metals could have a liquid phase that’s denser than solid phase is surprising, the researchers say.
“Metallic elements typically have such a close-packed structure that it seems impossible for the liquid phase to be denser than the solid—until one actually computes these densities,” says Qijun Hong, a research associate at Brown.
There’s currently no way on Earth to reach the extreme pressures that induce re-entrant heating in any metals beyond the alkalis, the researchers say. But the findings could have implications for understanding the composition of large exoplanets—planets beyond our solar system.
“It raises the possibility that the interior pressures of large planets could be sufficient to induce re-entrant melting,” van de Walle says. “That means their cores would consist of layers in a liquid-solid-liquid sequence, rather than the more common liquid-to-solid sequence.”
