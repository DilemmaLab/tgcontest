    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The space agency said they launched the mission to study the asteroid Bennu in 2016. Samples from the celestial body would not only shed light on how planets formed and life began, but also give a better understanding of how to protect our planet from an asteroid collision.
NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission made a surprising discovery when it spotted plumes of particles coming from the surface of the asteroid Bennu. The finding is not only rare, but is the first time that scientists observed particles being ejected from the surface of an asteroid up-close. It also proves that Bennu is an active asteroid.
OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer, “met” Bennu last year and the mission has been orbiting the asteroid ever since. The discovery itself was made in January this year, but scientists presented their observations in a study just days ago, on 6 December.
According to OSIRIS-REx’s science team, the eruptions of particles occurred in different places on the asteroid. The first event was spotted in its southern hemisphere, while a second and a third originated near Bennu's equator. The particles were released from the surface, briefly orbited Bennu and then fell back or flew into space. They travelled at a speed of 3 metres per second and measured from smaller than an inch to 10 cm.
The team then examined mechanisms that could lead to these mysterious ejections. They concluded that it could be due to:
Scientists note that identifying the exact mechanism that leads to ejections of particles will be quite difficult.
Many of the particles are small enough for OSIRIX-REx to collect them and deliver to Earth and further study of these particles and samples from Bennu will help scientists better understand asteroids – their similarities and differences – as well as ways to deflect asteroids if they are set on a collision course with our planet. Bennu, which is categorised as a near-Earth object could pass our planet closer than the Moon in 2135, with even closer approaches possible in 2175 and 2195. Meanwhile, OSIRIS-REx will start collecting samples from Bennu in the summer of 2020 and is scheduled to return them to Earth in 2023.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Discovery may open door to new medicines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bio-Protection Research Centre scientists and collaborators have made a discovery that potentially opens the door to new medicines and biological pesticides.
In work that began with a PhD thesis, and continued through postdoctoral work, they have shown that scientists have been missing potential new drugs and biopesticides, dismissing the genes that make them as non-functional variants.
“This is a fundamental discovery,” says Prof Barry Scott, who is based at Massey University. Prof Scott mentored Daniel Berry, the scientist who started investigating the “junk genes” as part of his PhD research in 2012.
Now Dr Berry is the lead author on the paper outlining the discovery, which has just been published in the highly prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr Berry’s discovery involves a group of “modular enzymes”, which naturally occur in fungi. Modular enzymes are molecular assembly lines that make bioactive substances, which scientists have harnessed to work as medicines, or as natural pesticides or growth enhancers in agriculture and horticulture.
The antibiotic penicillin is perhaps the best-known product of a modular enzyme.
In 2012, while researching for his PhD thesis, Dr Berry was investigating synthesis of peramine, a natural pasture pest-repellent made by a modular enzyme of the fungus Epichloë.
“A lot of the genes had been mucked up and didn’t make peramine,” says Prof Scott. “But one of those gene variants kept occurring, so although it looked like it wasn’t functioning, Daniel realised it had to serve some purpose, and decided to investigate.”
Prof Scott said for some time their investigations led nowhere. “That’s often the nature of science – it can take a long time.”
The breakthrough came when Daniel went to Germany to work with Dr Helge Bode, an expert in modular enzymes. With Dr Bode’s help, he discovered the modular enzyme from the variant gene produced a product they named cycloProArg, which is likely to be bioactive.
“It was an exciting day when we were finally able to identify what this gene was making,” says Dr Berry. “This discovery really opened the door for us, as it enabled identification of an additional three products that are made by other variants of this gene.”
“We don’t yet know precisely what cycloProArg does – that will be the subject of further research,” says Prof Scott. “But we know that as well as providing protection from pests, Epichloë promotes pasture growth and has lots of other beneficial effects. CycloProArg is probably responsible for one of those benefits.”
The real breakthrough, he says, is the discovery that modular enzymes make more than one bioactive product.
“Previously we thought one enzyme, one product,” says Prof Scott. “But we now know this is wrong.
“This fundamentally changes what we know, and what we should be looking for.
“Scientists in many fields – including medicine – should go back and take a look at previously discarded ‘junk genes’, because some of these may actually produce useful bioactive products.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to NASA’s Asteroid Fast Facts page, a lot of space material lands on Earth every year. From the NASA page:
“Every day, Earth is bombarded with more than 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles.
“About once a year, an automobile-sized asteroid hits Earth's atmosphere, creates an impressive fireball, and burns up before reaching the surface.
Every 2,000 years or so, a meteoroid the size of a football field hits Earth and causes significant damage to the area.”
When is the next one coming? No one knows. But NASA and other organizations worldwide constantly watch out for possible impactors from space. Even so, some escape discovery until they hit. In 2013, a small asteroid, about the size of a six-story building, entered our atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russian. It exploded with a blast more powerful than the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. The blast shattered glass in buildings all over the city and caused injuries to more than 1,200 people. It was so bright that scientists estimate it briefly outshone the sun. We had no warning of this event. No one saw it coming.
Many telescopes automatically search the night sky for incoming asteroids, for one with Earth in its sights. But scientists need your help finding them. You may be the one to spot the next one that threatens Earth.
An organization called Zooniverse currently has 108 projects where anyone, even you, can help scientists make new discoveries. I have written about Zooniverse before, but they have added quite a few new projects since then and more are added every year. You can find them at www.zooniverse.org.
The project to help find potentially dangerous asteroid is at www.zooniverse.org/projects/sandorkruk/hubble-asteroid-hunter. As with all the Zooniverse projects, you get a brief tutorial on what to look for and how to identify a target. Then you are presented with a series of photos. Using what you learned in the tutorial, you identify potential asteroid targets. Once identified, the project scientists analyze the photo to calculate the asteroid’s path to determine if Earth is in the way.
If saving the Earth from asteroid impacts isn’t your cup of tea, look through all of their projects. It’s likely one or several of the others will pique your interest.
Meteor Shower
The Geminid meteor shower peaks on the night of Friday and Saturday. While it can produce as many as 100 meteors per hour, a bright moon only three days past full will block out all but the brightest.
If you happen to be spending Christmas in Indonesia, Southeast Asia or Australia this year, step outside in the early afternoon. The moon passes between us and the sun, creating a solar eclipse. The moon is farther than average from us and won’t quite cover the entire disk of the sun. A ring, or annulus, of sunlight will encircle the dark moon, creating a relatively rare annular eclipse.
We won’t see any of this eclipse in Oklahoma. The next eclipse we see any part of in our state occurs on Oct. 14, 2023. But mark April 8, 2024, on your calendar. A total solar eclipse passes over southeast Oklahoma on that day, the best eclipse to hit our state in living memory.
Planet Visibility Report
December begins with Mars and Mercury in the pre-dawn sky. Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are grouped fairly close together low in the evening twilight. Over the course of the month, Venus gets higher, while the other two sink into invisibility on the twilight. Mercury also dives into the sun’s morning twilight glare, and by month’s end, only Venus in the evening sky and Mars in the morning sky remain visible. Full moon occurs on the 11th with new moon following on Christmas day.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It will be mostly sunny today, but some places in lowlands and valleys will be foggy for most of the day.
It will be a fairly calm day, light south wind forecast in eastern Bulgaria. Maximum temperatures between 7C and 12C, lower in areas with lasting fog. Atmospheric pressure will drop; it will be below average for the month.
This is the the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (NIMH) weather forecast.
