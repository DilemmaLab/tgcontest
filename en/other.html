    <h5 class="mb-1">Chrissy Teigen answers all our questions on celebs and their lavish lifestyles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chrissy Teigen gave us a glimpse into the elite lives of A-list celebrities by revealing their secret perks.
The Lip Sync Battle star took to Twitter to complete a Q&A on everything normal people wanted to know about ‘being a super huge A list celebrity’.
Retweeting a fans question asking whether rich people have a ‘junk drawer where they throw random cords and pens’, the 34-year-old responded: ‘it’s celebrity question asking time! Ask me, your favorite A list celebrity anything you would like to know about being a super huge A list celebrity’.
Chrissy – who is married to John Legend – must have regretted giving fans the opportunity because thousands of questions came flooding in immediately.
One fan asked: ‘Do you pay restaurants $ to let you cut the line? Or do they just do it automatically?’ to which Chrissy replied: ‘I make reservations and don’t give them the option to say no. “Hi it’s Chrissy Teigen and id like to make a reservation for 2 for John legend, do you have any availability?” if you just say “hi can I make a reservation for 2?” they say no. gotta say it all at once’.
Pro-tip, if you want to make a reservation, just pretend you’re a celebrity and hope the waiters never figure out you’re lying.
The next fan asked: ‘How the frick do most celebrities travel on planes? Are you ever just hustling through the airport trying to make it to your gate on time?’
A fair question, indeed, because we’ve all wondered how celebs travel without getting bombarded by fans in gross airport toilets.
The mum-of-two answered: ‘There is a terminal a mile from the airport that you pay membership for. they do the same security privately and take you to the plane in a car. I know. I know.’
How much is this membership, Chrissy? We need to know.
If anyone thinks celebrities get to roam around their 20-bedroom mansions with no disturbance, think again.
One fan asked whether assistants live with Chrissy and she answered: ‘We have a house manager who works at the house all day to handle our lives and day to day business, packages, scheduling for household staff etc’.
Not only that, but their assistants do their grocery shopping as well, so Chrissy and her husband probably never have to worry about running out of milk.
Plus, a personal chef helps them with most of the cooking.
As for bills and spending is handled by their very own business accountant.
Meanwhile, the rest of us barter whether a night out is worth eating instant ramen for the rest of the month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Acai bowls look pretty and delicious, but are they good for you?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Lifestyle Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:12:04 pm
The average acai bowl is filled with antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fibre, protein and healthy fats. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)
Acai bowls have been flooding our Instagram feeds for years now, and with good reason. They’re photogenic, delicious and healthy. The bowl gets its name from Açaí (pronounced ah-sigh-EE) which comes from the acai berry grown on the acai palm tree in South Amerian rainforests.
Now that you know a little about acai, what is an acai bowl?
These are acai berries at a plantation in Nordeste, Brazil. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)
The acai bowl, which originated in Brazil, is made of frozen acai palm fruit that is pureed and served as a smoothie in a bowl or glass. In Brazil, acai bowls are typically topped with granola, banana and various syrups. The sweeter versions are usually topped with nuts and exotic fruits, while the salty versions are topped with shrimp or dried fish.
Since acai berries are grown so far away, fresh ones are rarely available in India. Instead, freeze-dried powders or purees are often used to create the base of the bowl. These are mixed with a combination of ingredients such as almond milk, soy milk, nut butter, frozen fruit and fruit juice to achieve the desired thick consistency and taste.
This base is put in a bowl and topped with a few ingredients, such as granola, honey, nut butter or fresh fruit.
Are Acai bowls healthy?
Remember to always look at acai bowls as more of an occasional treat. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)
All the ingredients and toppings are pretty healthy, but bringing them together in the same dish raises a substantial issue — sugar. So as good as they look, are they good for your body too?
Remember to always look at acai bowls as more of an occasional treat, not something you’d have as a meal or a hearty breakfast. We say this because, as mentioned earlier, the ingredients in the base are acai puree and other fruits like berries and bananas, and granola toppings. It’s relatively high in vitamin C and fibre, but it contains a whopping amount of sugar.
Many people eat acai bowls for breakfast or a snack, thinking it is healthy. This way, the sugar content becomes even more of a concern. We know that consuming too much sugar has been linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other negative health outcomes and diseases. While acai bowls have a lot of good things going, their typical sky-high sugar count cannot be overlooked.
Can you enjoy an acai bowl every once in a while? Without a shadow of doubt, yes! But you shouldn’t be eating them for breakfast or lunch several times a week. A smarter approach might involve replacing desserts like ice-cream or frozen yoghurt with an occasional acai bowl.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adorable tot lights up the internet as real-life Elf on the Shelf</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the festive season gets into full swing, Facebook feeds across the globe are full of naughty elves causing mischief.
And this week the Advertiser discovered the cutest Elf on the Shelf EVER as little one-year-old Parker McShane causes all sorts of mischief at his home in Coatbridge.
Parker’s mum Shannen felt her little boy was too young to appreciate getting an elf on the shelf, so gave him the role of the elf in their house.
She said: “I loved doing Elf on the Shelf so much when I was a nursery teacher and knew Parker was too little to understand it.
“So I decided to make him the elf and just have fun doing naughty things every morning!”
Mischievous little Parker has been a busy elf. So far he has managed to cover his dad David’s face with lipstick, mess up the kitchen with chocolate and cereal, put balls down the toilet and unwrap toilet paper all over the floor!
And Shannen is sure there is lots more to come in December, as Parker loves being an Elf so much he is refusing to take his outfit off.
She added: “He loves it and is getting away with being naughty and likes us telling him how he cute he is as an elf.”
Shannen’s Facebook friends have been loving finding out what little Parker the Elf has been up to each day.
One said: “Aww that’s amazing!”
Another added: “I love that idea! He’s just adorable too! Cutest elf I have ever seen!”
While another wrote: “This is amazing. He looks so pleased, wee soul.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">1. King Arthur Flour Fresh Sourdough Starter($9)
"Sourdough baking can be challenging, to say the least," writes Sarah Jampel at Bon Appetit. This starter-in-a-jar takes the stress out of creating a fermented dough, and because it descends from a strain that's over 100 years old, "you know it's going to be bubbly, active, and reliable." Buy it at King Arthur Flour.
2. Silpat Half-Size Baking Mat($21)
Don't want to fuss with parchment paper? Place this French-made mat on a baking sheet to create a nonstick surface. Made of ­dishwasher-safe silicone embedded with heat-conducting fiberglass, the Silpat "performs beautifully." Buy it at Amazon.
3. Whetstone Woodenware French Rolling Pin ($27)
Tapered, French-style rolling pins offer far better control than pins with handles, and they're also easier to clean. This 23-inch maple pin is "ideal for rolling rounds of crust for pie," writes Hannah Kirshner at The Wirecutter, and it's "sturdy enough to last a lifetime." Buy it at Whetstone Woodenware.
4. Jenaluca Cookie Scoop($18)
A sturdy portion scoop is the secret to making trays of uniform-size cookies quickly. And once you have one, you might also reach for it when making cupcakes, muffins, or meatballs. Available in three sizes or as a three-piece set. Buy it at Amazon.
5. CDN TM8 Multi-Task Timer($16)
This trusty little kitchen timer "will become your handy sidekick," writes Zoë Sessums at Bon Appetit. The TM8 can clip to an apron, stick to a fridge, and track multiple tasks at once. After ringing, it begins counting up, so you know how much time has elapsed. Buy it at Amazon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grind London Drops Monochromatic Graphic-Heavy "Testing Waters" FW19 Part 2 Collection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Grind London has released the second part of its Fall/Winter 2019 offerings dubbed “Testing Waters,” adding a range of graphic-heavy pieces to its overarching “Still Waters Are Wet” FW19 collection.
“Testing Waters” is comprised of heavyweight T-shirts, Rayon shirts, twill and corduroy jackets, chore jackets and long-sleeve T-shirts adorned with standout monochromatic prints. Numerous garments work together as a two-piece, with the “Testing Waters” graphic and the kitsch Seal “Space Race” print featuring on shirts, trousers and jackets that can be worn individually or together for an even bolder look.
Elsewhere, Grind London offers up a twill jacket sporting the label’s “Solo Lanes” print — making for one of the collection’s best pieces — as well as a variety of graphic T-shirts. The short sleeve and long-sleeve tops feature slogan such as “Himalayan Herb,” “Unity Sound” and “Don’t Watch Me, Watch Hypernormalisation.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Converse has updated its iconic Chuck 70 Hi with a Winter-ready construction of “Navy Blue” and “Baby Pink” shearling and suede.
The classic silhouette is offered up using premium materials throughout, from its multicolored suede upper to the brown leather debossed All Star branding. Most notably, this Chuck 70 Hi sports a split colorway, with “Navy Blue” adorning the lateral, “Baby Pink” encompassing the medial side, and brown suede breaking the two apart by taking over the tongue, toe box and heel stripe.
Converse has also implemented a cozy shearling lining that matches the sneaker’s muted tri-color palette, wrapping around the inside respective of each shade used. Keeping things original is an off-white sole unit sporting a black running stripe all around the midsole, as well as a black license plate and a brown outsole. Completing this pair is a set of silver-toned eyelets with white laces running up the tongue.
Take a look at the Converse Chuck 70 Hi “Navy Blue/Baby Pink” Shearling in the gallery above. You can pick up a pair for yourself on December 14 for £109 GBP (approx. $143 USD) via retailers such as Sneakersnstuff.

There are lots of different types of electric bikes, including mountain, road, hybrid, folding and more. Plus, there are various places the motor can live: the front or rear wheel, or by the cranks.
More importantly is whether the motor uses a simple motion sensor or a more advanced torque sensor to decide how much power to apply. In short, it’s best to get a bike with a torque sensor – if you can afford the higher prices they command.
You'll find more buying advice in our roundup of the best electric bikes.
If you don’t like the look of any of the bike deals here, then shop around and see if you can find any deals we’ve missed.

However, if you’re willing to accept a shop demo bike or one with slight cosmetic damage, there are discounts to be had from sites such as Fully Charged.

Even at the higher price, this is one of the cheapest electric bikes available in the UK, and this is a good discount of that. It's basic, there's no doubt of that, but if you want an electric bike on a tight budget without importing it from China, this is a good option.
From: Rutland CyclineWas: £1299Now: £749  (£550 off) View Deal
A great big 42% off the original price of this electric mountain bike makes the Focus Whistler2 a very good deal. The spec isn't what we'd call high end, and it wouldn't be great value at £1299, but at this price, you can probably live with Shimano Altus gears. 
Like Gtech's Sport bike, this one has no buttons or display on the handlebars: you simply turn it on and go.
There's a choice of small, medium and large frames, with the latter two having 29in wheels and the small one coming with 27.5in. Note that none come with pedals!
Even so, it's a lot of electric bike for the money.
From: Cycle RepublicWas: £3899Now: £2299  (£1600 off) View Deal
A high-end electric mountain bike, the Aspect e10 comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a Bosch CX system with a Purion display. Pedals aren't included with this model, but you can save an extra £150 of this price until 18 November using the code SAVE150 at the checkout.
From: HalfordsWas: £1799Now: £1619  (£180 off) View Deal
Using the Bosch Active Line crank-driven motor and torque sensor, the Felix is a well-equipped touring or commuting bike with 700c wheels. Despite the 300Wh battery, range is up to 60 miles. 
The discount isn't massive, but it's still worth having.
From: HalfordsWas: £1599Now: £1099  (£500 off) View Deal
The Ebco is a mid-range mountain bike with a large-capacity 400Wh battery that's good for 35-55 miles between charges. It comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a mid-mounted motor.
It's also good to see Tektro hydraulic disc brakes for good stopping power.
It's a fine deal at this price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Best STEM Christmas Gifts For Kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It can feel like the holiday toy-buying gets a little out of hand this time of year. We want to see our kids’ faces light up on Christmas morning, but we don’t want to drown in a sea of plastic to make it happen. That’s why adding a couple of STEM toys into the mix can be such a great middle ground. Kids are naturally curious little beings who like to dabble in science, technology, engineering and maths; parents like to feel as though at least some of their toys have educational value.
So I did some digging to pull together a few classic STEM toys, as well as newer arrivals that will bring out the curious learner in any child on your holiday list this year.
I see no reason not to start teaching chemistry to your baby when we’ve got a book like Organic Chemistry for Babies at our disposal to introduce “the structure of organic, carbon-containing compounds and materials.”
Of course, as they get older, a beginner’s science experiment kit is also a must-have and there are lots of variations out there. You can’t go wrong with Fat Brain’s version, the Disgusting Science Kit, which encourages both scientific learning and potty humour.
Also, crystals. Kids love to grow some crystals, and this Mega Crystal Growing Lab from National Geographic will teach kids about crystal formation and it gives them a nightlight base to display five of their favourite crystals in their bedroom when they’re all done. It’ll be the beginning of their rock collection, because childhood is not childhood without a rock collection.
Another staple for every young scientist is a microscope, and Educational Insights has a couple of good options: The GeoSafari Jr. My First Microscope for preschoolers and the GeoSafari Jr. Talking Microscope for young elementary-aged kids. (Their Kidnoculars are pretty great, too.)
You’re already teaching your baby organic chemistry, so you might as well also grab a copy of Robotics for Babies; it’s never too early to learn these concepts.
Then, by the time your kid is around four years old, it’s time to learn a little coding! You can start to introduce the basic concepts of coding with this 22-piece “Coding Critter” play set. Or, for a more classic robotic look, you might try the Code ‘n Learn Kinderbot, which is also good for ages 3 to 6.
There are coding robots for older kids, too, like the Anki Cozmo, which has an easy-to-use interface that Good Housekeeping says allows kids to “explore and build programs from basic to more advanced.” It’s recommended for kids ages 8 and older.
I have to start this section with one of my all-time favourite building toys: Magna-Tiles.
At $90 for a starter set of 37 pieces, they’re a little pricey (and there are cheaper versions of the same idea out there), but they’re incredibly sturdy. My son got his first set when he was four years old and just the other day, I came downstairs to find he had pulled them out from under the couch and was building some kind of structure to go along with other toys he was playing with. He’s nine years old now. We’ve built everything from simple ice cream cones to elaborate castles with these things, and every kid should have a set.
Runners-up for fun building toys:
For more magnetic fun, the 51-piece GeoSmart Mars Explorer vehicle set is another solid option for kids who want to practice their engineering skills. It comes with four how-to designs, but kids can also create their own.
There’s also the ABCs of Engineering book for the littlest ones. A is for Amplifier, B is for Battery, C is for Carnot Engine. This book will give your infant a solid engineering foundation.
You should, of course, start with the Bayesian Probability for Babies book. (I can’t help myself; I love these so much.)
As they reach preschool age, the Monkey Maths game comes recommended from a couple of parents in our Offspring Facebook Group as a hands-on way to introduce simple addition to young kids. I also like the Super Sorting Pie, which includes 60 counters (seven fruits in five different colours).
Maths Dice Jr. is a good option for kids around six years old—it helps them practice addition and subtraction quickly in their head (and it’s small, so it would make a great stocking stuffer). For a more mathematically advanced child, you might try Maths for Love’s Prime Climb, which utilises addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to move around the board.
For a mix of new STEM activities, you might consider a subscription-based option like KiwiCo, which sends out “crates” of science-, engineering- and art-based projects each month. You can select a membership by age—starting as young as 0-24 months old for the “panda” line and up to a variety of options for teenagers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Lazy Man's Guide To Losing Fat And Building Muscle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Like most guys of a certain vintage, I have mixed feelings about my body. Staying lean and not surrendering to the siren’s call of the dreaded 'Dadbod' is a key concern. But then so is building and maintaining enough muscle so that I can keep up with the young bucks on the soccer field or in the gym.
One of the main keys to success is your diet. You need a meal plan that's high in healthy carbs, fats and proteins. More importantly, it needs to be easy to prepare and affordable - so you'll actually stick to it.
There's no shortage of tips that deal with actual exercise on Lifehacker - instead, this guide focuses on the fuel you should be preparing to build muscle and reduce body fat.
Part anabolic diet, part ketogenic diet and part dopamine diet, this all-rounder is perfect for anyone looking to stay on the health train. It's a super-simple diet protocol that provides everything we need to train, grow, recover and sleep, with minimum disruption to our lives and, critically, not sacrificing taste or enjoyment.
Consider it a dietary form of GPP (General Physical Preparedness). With bodily GPP I want to be able to achieve a number of feats or accomplishments at any given time with no specific training.
For nutritional general preparedness, we’re:
Is it boring to eat this way? Or a chore? Not really. The healthy fats in this diet provide both satiety and sufficient hits of dopamine to keep cravings at bay. Permanently.
Can you eat this way if you have kids? Yes, absolutely. A few variations for Junior and you’re there.
Most supplements are stuffed with all kinds of chemicals that you can't pronounce. It’s a multi-billion-dollar industry that promises silver-bullets yet delivers (mostly) damp squibs.
However, as a guy in a hurry, I need fuel after workouts and to kick-start the day. Sleep is catabolic, meaning it depletes your muscles. That's not good, especially if you're on the lean side to begin with (what's known in the trade as a 'hard-gainer'.)
A sound guiding principle is to start the day with 30g of protein if you're serious about building muscle.
A brown-rice based, all-natural protein is probably a little less effective than some of the other stuff but it helps get me to my macros and I feel somewhat better about it, especially as I'm going to be drinking three of these a day.
A more elaborate 'one-pan keto-feast’' could include sausages, green vegetables, smoked salmon but that will take more time than we have to play with. The omelette is super-speedy.
Variations on this theme could be to include a bowl of porridge and stirring through some protein powder to make 'chocolate protein oats'. The only ingredients for this are milk, water, oats and your protein - in less than 7 minutes you’ll be fuelling up for the day ahead.
In terms of bang-for-your-buck and downright convenience, you can't go past this combination - the Holy Trinity of lunchtime goodness.
Try Sirena tuna, whose label reassures that it's line caught and sustainable etc. Basil oil flavour is especially tasty. Add a tin of Edgells 4 Bean Mix and 90 Second microwave brown rice.
Throw grated cheese over the top of this for more fat, and because, well, cheese makes everything taste better.
Total cost per meal: $5.35
You could roast / bake a tray of vegetables and chuck some chicken breast in the other side of the tray (covered in a little foil tent for half the cooking time (usually 30-35 mins) to stop it drying out.
The beauty of this is that once you've tossed it in the oven, you can go and workout for a bit or play with junior.
However, if you can get yourself a microwave steamer, your whole whole world will change.
Here's how.
Chop up your veg and layer it in the steamer according to how long it takes to cook. Then steam it for about 4 minutes. [Note: sweet potato can handle around 3 mins on its own before you add the greens for the remaining 4 mins. This depends on the power of your microwave so play around with it.]
This could be the end of the story. You serve up your greens with your meat (which you've pan-fried and rested under foil and out of the pan for 5 minutes - this is crucial.)
You'll probably want some seasoning with this though.
Or take things to a completely different level with only a modicum of extra effort.
Drain the veggies, blanche under cold water to stop the cooking process, throw a decent knob of butter into the meat pan and then mix the greens through the butter.
In a restaurant this would be called something like 'twice-cooked greens, keto-style,' or something equally grand, and, as with a lot of the cooking here, it depends on your approach to fats and what your nutritional objectives are.
Additional fats, especially those that have traditionally been considered unhealthy, is
But, if you still want flavour and satiety, then it's worth trying because it makes them taste delicious.
This plan works for busy guys (and gals) for a few key reasons:
Is it perfect? Nope.
Could it be made healthier? Yep, pretty easily. Sub in celery sticks dipped in almond butter for one of the snacks would be an easy tweak.
But bang-for-your-buck simplicity, economy and taste it’s right on the money.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christine Diane Teigen is a godsend. She also has an uncanny sense of understanding when us common folk thirst for some tea about celebrity life.
Today, she jumped on Twitter, asking the web to tweet her questions about “being a super huge A list celebrity”. From the perks of fame to public transport and award shows, Chrissy subsequently provided a rather candid glimpse into her life as an A-lister. There’s literally hours of tweets in the Q&A, but we picked out the juicy ones (you’re so damn welcome). So please, sit back and a envision a day when you, too, will miss going to the grocery store.
First up: the tweet that started it all.
Aaaaaaand let’s dive straight into all things Tinseltown, courtesy of queen Chrissy.
From not taking public transport in 10 years, to paying for a whole other private airport terminal, Chrissy’s life sure seems otherworldly, doesn’t it? I’m also sobbing at the mental image of John making pancakes for the kids in the morning. This family can certainly do no wrong.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another much anticipated glamour event of the year, Star Screen Awards 2019, took place in the city yesterday. From Ananya Panday, Sara Ali Khan, to Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Shahid Kapoor, Ranveer Singh amongst others, celebs put their best fashion foot forward. But did their fashion choices really work out as they expected them to? Let’s find out.
From Sara Ali Khan’s glittery attire to Shahid Kapoor’s funky look – below are the Best and the Worst dressed of Star Screen Awards 2019:
Sara Ali Khan
No matter what she wears, her grace just makes everything look better. Sara opted for a Paule Ka black and white outfit, which had a bow at the back, leading to a long trail. She complimented the look with no makeup look, heart shaped earrings and studded stilettos. We only wish if the Simmba actress could have been a bit more experimental with her hair.
Ananya Panday
One thing we really like, is that Kiara’s been experimental with every look of her this year, and well this one has worked out really well too! The deep-neck Gauri & Nainika gown looked really well on the actress, and the hairdo just made her look more chic. A total thumbs up!
Deepika Padukone
Just when you’ll feel you’d have enough, Deepika Padukone is here to impress you with another outfit and leave you mesmerised. DP opted for a body fitted gown (without any thigh slits, thank god because clearly, we’ve had enough of that). The one-sided sleeve of the Alex Perry outfit, alongwith the long trail was perfectly complimented with her new short hair, and as always, take notes you guys!
Shahid Kapoor
Black and white, really seem to be Shahid’s colour. The actress after his recent appearance in a black and white printed suit, is back to impress you. This time decked up in a zebra print, Shahid Kapoor’s dapper attitude is what compliments his looks the best. This one just is another saga of it!
Kiara Advani
Kiara Advani’s latest fashion choices have left her massive fan base stunned lately. However, this time we’re left confused. From the floral print, to the sheer gown, with the thigh slit and the bow on one sided shoulder – there was too much in the single piece that we were left confused to what we should focus on. Honestly, we felt this wasn’t really ‘the Kiara level’.
Kartik Aaryan:
Kartik Aaryan hosted the Star Screen Awards in a deep blue blazer, and a well fitted pants of the same colour. The white shirt and striped bow, we feel, were too low for the glamour vibe. Aaryan should have adopted a little more stylish avatar, dodging the usuals.
Ranveer Singh:
Ranveer Singh has always left us in awe with his unique fashion statements. Remember the recent 80s look which clearly seemed to have taken over his ‘Satuday night fever’? That’s what we were expecting from him, rather than this usual embroidered silver suit. Clearly, the expectations from the actor are wayyyy high, blame it on him!
Ayushmann Khurrana:
We love how Ayushmann’s been trying to move ahead of the usuals and come up with something worth our while. While his complete white look at the Filmfare Glamour awards seemed to be a total trend setter, he seems to have gone a little overboard with the silver embroidery on the blazer.
Bhumi Pednekar
No offence, but we really feel Bhumi needs to change her stylist. While her recent appearances during the Pati Patni Aur Woh promotions grabbed eyeballs, the golden gown didn’t really suit her, specially the colour. Bhumi has posted another picture with a little different shade (thanks to the filters), and honestly just the change in colour seems to have made so much difference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Ford Ranger is dressed up in carbon fiber</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever since the T6 Ford Ranger made its debut back in 2011, owners have been busy tricking it out, as well as dressing it up with countless modifications. From making them into 4x4 rigs, to classy road-going machines, it goes to show how customizable the Blue Oval's pick-up truck is.
But what if you preferred to completely deck out your own Ford Ranger with a plethora of carbon fiber trim? Then why not take a look at what Motion R has available for the T6 Ranger. Based in the United Kingdom, Motion R decided to extensively use carbon fiber reinforced plastic to decorate the pick-up truck.
From the front bumper, front wings, rear quarter panels, as well as the rear bumper; Motion R decked out the Ranger with the lightweight composite. This gives the pick-up truck a cool and an unmistakable look. Further complementing the Ranger's sleek carbon fiber appearance are the LED daytime running lights on the bumper, the huge carbon fiber hood, 'Motion R' carbon fiber front grill, and the 20-inch 'OR21' concave alloy wheels.
Aside from the carbon fiber upgrade, Motion R also installed several aerodynamic upgrades. These include a front splitter, a rear bumper upgrade with an integrated diffuser, and a tailgate spoiler for good measure.
Interior photos were not provided by Motion R. However, they did mention that also put carbon fiber dashboard trim that is available in either 2x2 weave or forged carbon. There's even a flat-bottomed steering wheel with perforated leather. Finally, an optional full nappa leather interior can be specified for the Ford Ranger.
Want to have your Ford Ranger fitted with plenty of carbon fiber goodies? You better cough up GBP 39,995 or about Php 2.670 million to have it done, and that doesn't come with the full nappa leather upholstery. Expensive, yes. But is it worth it? Chime in your comments below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologizes for Santa sweater with drug reference</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(CNN) - Walmart apologized for selling sweaters that appear to show Santa Claus with lines of cocaine.
The sweater has the words "Let it snow" and includes three white lines in front of Santa.
Part of the description said, "The best snow comes straight from South America." It added "Santa really likes to savor the moment when he gets his hands on some quality, grade-A, Colombian snow."
Walmart said the sweater was sold online in Canada by a third-party vendor and has been removed.
The company said the sweaters do not represent its values.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An earthquake of magnitude 3.1 on the Richter scale was felt at dawn on Faial Island on 9 December, in an area that since the beginning of November has seen an increase in seismic activity.
According to the Azores Seismovulcanic Surveillance and Information Centre (CIVISA), at 3.15am (Lisbon time) an earthquake of magnitude 3.1 (Richter) and the epicentre were recorded about 32 kilometres west of Capelo, Faial Island.
According to available information, the earthquake was felt with maximum intensity III (Modified Mercalli Scale) in Capelo parish (Horta municipality, Faial island).
CIVISA says it continues to monitor developments and will issue further announcements if necessary.
This was at least the third earthquake felt in the same zone in two days. On Saturday, 7 December, two aftershocks were recorded on the Azorean island of Faial, one at dawn (3.2 on the Richter scale) and another in the afternoon (3.5).
Since 3 November, the west of Faial has been experiencing an increase in seismic activity.
Earthquakes are classified according to their magnitude as micro (less than 2.0), very small (2.0-2.9), small (3.0-3.9), slight (4.0-4.9), moderate (5.0-5.9), strong (6.0-6.9), large (7.0-7.9), important (8.0-8.9), exceptional (9, 0-9,9) and extreme (greater than 10).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"When the light begins to fade, I sometimes feel a little strange, A little anxious when it's dark". Derrière ces mots de la chanson "Fear of the dark" du fameux groupe de heavy Metal des année 70 Iron Maiden, nous trouvons un mod quelque peu étrange mais qui présente un travail acharné. Même si nous trouvons le nom commun (et aussi le look discutable), le mod que nous vous présentons n'a rien à voir avec ce groupe.
Littéralement Iron maiden signifie la vierge de fer. Et c'est sur ce thème que le moddeur Ali Abbas a travaillé. Beaucoup de travail à la main, le moddeur s'étant mis le défi de n'utiliser que des outils guidés à la main. Du bois donc avec une peinture maitrisée pour ressembler à du fer forgé, des jeux de lumière et le bien connu Cosmos C700M de Cooler Master se transforme en prison pour composants et finalement ressembler de plus en plus à la citation en introduction. Il suffit de regarder la vidéo pour le comprendre.
Vous pouvez aussi suivre le travail et admirer le résultat avec beaucoup plus de photos en suivant la source.
