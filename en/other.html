    <h5 class="mb-1">The 10 Best Los Angeles Dishes of 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES — Throughout my first year as a restaurant critic living in Los Angeles, zigzagging across the city in my car, I kept a running list of delicious things I wanted to tell you about.
There was the sheer, oversize tortilla sobaquera that I had at El Ruso in Boyle Heights just the other day — its floury edges charred on a convex comal, its stretchy folds stuck together with melted cheese, all of it dipped, bite by bite, into hot broth.
The kibbe nayeh at Skaf’s, in Glendale, was on my list, too. The pile of raw meat was dressed so that it shined luxuriously with fat, but seasoned and presented so daintily.
Over the summer, I flagged the creamy melon gelato at Antico, somehow more concentrated in flavor and perfume than a piece of ripe fruit, and tinted the pale pinkish orange of the sun setting on Beverly Boulevard.
There were so many extraordinary dishes — old and new, inexpensive and exorbitant, vegan and meaty — but it’s listicle season, so I’ve narrowed it down to 10.
Minh Phan’s Thursday-night dinners in Historic Filipinotown are a deal — $30 for a three-course meal — but they also remind you that Ms. Phan is running a fine-dining kitchen with finesse and virtuosity, even though Porridge and Puffs disguises itself as a casual grain-bowl restaurant. One of the best ways to experience the weekly shifts in Los Angeles seasonality, from persimmons and sweet potatoes to pears and radishes, is her porridge with pickles and jam, a warm bowl of rice absolutely covered with fresh herbs, greens and vegetables. It’s finished with a dollop of makrut-lemongrass jam that she makes in-house, so delicious-smelling you’ll want to dab it on like perfume.
2801 Beverly Boulevard (North Occidental Boulevard), Historic Filipinotown; 213-908-5313; porridgeandpuffs.com.
Picture brisket, striped with fat, marked with the char of wood fire, and cooked to such tenderness that it doesn’t even require a knife. A giant pile of (thick, golden, perfectly seasoned) fries is the only clue that this is, in fact, a plate of steak frites. Sure, there are more traditional versions of the dish on Jeremy Fox’s menu at Birdie G’s, but this mustard-coated brisket, cooked low and slow as if in your auntie’s slow-cooker, is the most striking and succulent.
2421 Michigan Avenue (24th Street), Santa Monica; 310-310-3616; birdiegsla.com.
It’s hard for me to examine Onda, a new collaboration between the chefs Jessica Koslow and Gabriela Cámara, without nerdily taking it apart. How did the idea begin, and build? Who is responsible for what? Luckily, pleasure gets in the way, and sometimes there’s nothing to do but sit back and enjoy their cooking. The sweet potatoes have a thick, crisp crust that’s as satisfying to crunch down on as the skin of a Roman porchetta. The brawny pieces are steaming and tender inside, served with a cool crema and a seedy salsa macha. The salsa’s chile-stained oil, which messily dribbles out of the warm corn tortillas, slowly builds with heat.
700 Wilshire Boulevard (Seventh Street), Santa Monica; 310-620-9917; onda.la.
The flashiest bit of French haute cuisine in the chef Dave Beran’s dining room is the goth duck press making the rounds on a trolley, creaking as it crushes bone and blood. But the liver in brioche — a version of Escoffier’s classic dish that complies with the statewide ban on foie gras by substituting chicken liver — is a less conspicuous and far more difficult dish to execute. The liver is full of fat and booze, absurdly creamy and dense, while the brioche is feathery-light, tasting purely of butter, yeast and air. This would already be pretty sumptuous, but black truffle snow adds perfume and old-school charm.

One of the finest ways to spend a weekend morning in Los Angeles is sitting by the railroad tracks on Slauson Avenue, surrounded by families, staining your fingers with the glowing red consomé from Teddy Vasquez’s distinguished taco truck. Yes, there’s a wait (prepare!), and no bathroom (prepare!), but the Tijuana-style birria, made with beef and layered with fresh salsa in consomé-dipped tortillas, will slowly work to erase all inconveniences. The deluxe plate offers up the tender, brothy birria in all forms, from a cheesy quesadilla to a taco dripping with consomé, showing off what it can do in each.

The name is as aggressively plain as a steamed chicken breast, and the dish, at David Chang’s fun, pleasingly tough-to-categorize Los Angeles restaurant, celebrates that plainness. It arrives first in the shape of sliced white meat on hot rice with ginger-scallion and chile sauces. The dark meat follows with hand-torn noodles in an absurdly rich chicken broth that leaves your lips sticky.

From the softly chewy rice to the dashi-poached fava beans to the sweet, crisp-edged crab dumplings, every single bite in Brandon Hayato Go’s lunchbox is made with care. Reservations are hard to come by at the tiny kaiseki restaurant in Row DTLA (the same high-end shopping mall that hosts Smorgasburg on Sundays), even for these lunches that diners carry out. Put yourself on the list to be notified of cancellations, and if a spot opens up, pounce.

You visit Spoon & Pork for patita — the glistening fried pork shank — or for adobo pork belly on pressed rice, served like nigiri. But somehow, in a Filipino restaurant named for a meat that it cooks exceptionally well, it’s the vegan jackfruit dish that preoccupied me. And it’s the jackfruit, not the patita, that I dragged as close to me as possible at the table, like an animal with its prey, wanting to taste every part of it in every possible combination. The fruit, braised in coconut milk, maintains its sweetness on a bed of purple Thai rice, perfumed with ginger and garlic and seasoned with salty, lip-smacking black bean paste that you can use at your discretion (all of it would be too much).
3131 Sunset Boulevard (Descanso Drive), Silver Lake; 323-922-6061; spoonandpork.com.
When I think back on 2019, I’ll think of the endless line for hot chicken at Howlin’ Ray’s, curving through Far East Plaza in Chinatown, growing even as it moves along. But it was the fried chicken with hot sauce at the chef Keith Corbin’s restaurant Alta in West Adams that shone. The meat is encased in sheer, delicately crisp, crackling skin, which is deep-fried, then baked and finished in a skillet to achieve the effect.
5359 West Adams Boulevard (South Burnside Avenue), West Adams; 323-571-4999; altaadams.com.
Josef Centeno’s restaurant serves the queso and the puffy tacos that have come to define Tex-Mex. But its most exciting dishes take a more elliptical kind of inspiration from the cuisine’s roots as ranch cooking, making use of the grill and low-and-slow braising to get the most out of local ingredients. When hamachi collars are grilled, the skin gets crisp, and the rendered, fatty juices run through the meat. Use the soft flour tortillas to build tacos, but don’t ignore the bone on the plate — the best bits of fish cling to it, almost gelatinous, and you can get at them with your teeth.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seduced and abandoned: tourism and climate change in the Alps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deserted ski lifts and ruined hotels are some of the relics of a tourist industry that first seduced and then abandoned the Alps, along with cement, steel cables, paved car parks and deforested slopes.
From Piedmont to Friuli, there are hundreds of abandoned ski resorts in Italy. Researchers counted 186 in 2011, a number that is likely to have grown since.
Warmer winters and shorter ski seasons combined with bad investments and high running costs have contributed to the slow death of small- and mid-sized ski resorts.
The past four years have been the world’s hottest on record, with mountainous areas particularly susceptible to climate change: every 1C of temperature increase on the plains corresponds to a 2C rise in the Alps.
Academics from ETH Zürich have forecast an increase of between 2.5C and 4.5C for Switzerland by 2050, and a similar situation is expected across the rest of the Alps.
With forecasts like these, the future of ski resorts at lower altitudes grows less certain, and those that do survive are forced to rely increasingly on artificial snow.
“This past ski season, until February, the majority of ski resorts worked almost exclusively thanks to artificial snow,” said Francesco Pastorelli, of the International Commission for the Protection of the Alps (Cipra). “This has obvious consequences on the environment, and on the economic sustainability of ski resorts.”
The Alps’ spectacular panoramas have changed, with white tongues of artificial snow now stretching through yellow meadows. Skiers queue to descend slopes that are increasingly frozen or rotten.
Few of them realise how expensive it is to produce artificial snow, which costs €3-5 per cubic metre. Italy has about 2,500 miles (4,000km) of ski slopes, and the bill for covering them with fake snow adds up to €500m (£420m) every season.
But although tourists and investors have fled from many areas, there are still people who have no intention of leaving.
Renzo Pinard owns the Belvedere hotel in Pian del Frais, a ski resort in Piedmont. In recent years there has not been enough snow for the resort to open, and tourists who used to visit have started holidaying elsewhere. Homes in the town are plastered with For Sale signs.
Pinard is one of the town’s last inhabitants. “This is my land, it is the story of my family,” he said. “I will never leave. Places like Pian del Frais can survive but we need to change our mind and find alternatives to alpine skiing.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A delicious festive starter that can be adapted to serve with a sweet topping for the kidsMeera Sodha’s vegan Christmas starter of kimchi gyoza
Smoked trout is a delicious alternative to smoked salmon. These blinis are a lovely way to top or tail Christmas Day, and children can opt for a ricotta, lemon zest and maple topping, if they are squeamish about the fish.
Prep 45 minRest 2 hrCook 10 minServes 6
75g buckwheat flour75g strong white flourSalt and pepper150ml milk3g dried yeast2 eggs, separated100g creme fraiche or soured creamZest of 1 lemon250g ricotta1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil30g butter
To serve100g organic or wild smoked salmon or trout (I like Pished Fish), slicedChopped chivesLumpfish or salmon caviar (optional)
Sift the flours and a teaspoon of salt into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Bring the milk to simmering point in a small pan over a medium heat, then remove from the heat and whisk in the yeast, egg yolks and creme fraiche. Pour slowly into the flour, beating it in bit by bit with a wooden spoon. When the batter is smooth, cover and leave in a warm place for 30-60 minutes, to prove (depending on how much time you have).
Beat the egg whites to soft peaks in a clean bowl, then fold into the batter with a metal spoon. Leave for another 30-60 minutes to prove again. Meanwhile, add the lemon zest to the ricotta and stir in the oil. Cut the lemon into wedges and season the ricotta with a squeeze of juice from one of the wedges, along with some salt and pepper.
When you’re ready to eat, heat a large frying pan on a medium-high heat until smoking hot. Add the butter, then teaspoons of the batter, and cook until bubbles appear. Flip over and cook for another minute or so on the other side, until golden. Cook in batches, keeping the cooked ones warm in a low oven.
Serve the pancakes warm with a dollop of ricotta, a few slices of trout or salmon, a sprinkle of chives, a little caviar and lemon wedges. Alternatively, if you have children with a sweet tooth, whip half the ricotta with a little sugar instead of salt, and serve with runny honey or maple syrup instead of the salmon.
My first thought was to recommend iced vodka shots, but that’s more New Year’s Eve than Christmas Day. Fizz is an option (see here for my festive recommendations), but a good sauvignon blanc would be even better.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mattress thieves: why light-fingered hotel guests are now a very big problem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Name: Mattress theft.
Age: Young. This is recent.
Really? Haven’t burglars always looked under the mattress when on a job? Loads of people treat under the mattress like a savings account. This isn’t about stealing what’s under the mattress, it’s about taking the actual mattress.
Sounds awkward! Where are these mattresses being stolen from?Hotels.
It was Lenny Henry! I saw him in one of those beds from the purple hotel, on the beach, also at King’s Cross station. That was an advert, for Premier Inn. This is real. And the hotels are a lot posher.
Posher than a Premier Inn? Shut up! Seriously, we’re talking five stars here.
OK, I have a confession to make: there has been the odd occasion when we have stayed at hotels and nicked the shower gel. Of course, you have to! Along with all the toiletries.
Also the sewing kit and the sponge thing for shining shoes, and the slippers. Naturally.
We have thought about taking the bathrobes, too, but bottled it. Yeah, they are on to that. They now try to guilt you into buying them.
Obviously, we weren’t going to do that. So we took a couple of the smaller towels instead … and the iron. Really?!
Mattresses, though! That seems like a step too far. Agreed, but a survey of hoteliers has discovered that theft of luxury mattresses is becoming what is known in the hotel business as “a thing”.
Especially for five-star hotels? Correct. They are eight times more likely to be robbed of a mattress than four-star hotels. Mattress technology has become so advanced that luxury hotels now pride and promote themselves on their mattresses, which can be worth several thousand pounds, making them a top target.
Yeah, but … You’re going to ask how you sneak it past reception, right?
Exactly! How does it work? You get someone to distract them by asking if they have got a city map, while you just sneak past and pray there isn’t a revolving door? No. The survey, by Wellness Hotels, finds that most mattresses go missing during the night from hotels with direct elevator access to their underground car park.
Gotcha. A quick check of the corridor, into the lift, hit CP, into the van and away. Sweet dreams! For ever, and thank you for the memory foam.
Do say: “Minibar? Yes, just the one Heineken, and a packet of nuts.”
Don’t say: “Oh, plus a handmade luxury pocket-sprung super king size, upholstered using layered cashmere, mohair and alpaca …”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christmas sides: Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipe for harissa and gruyere gratin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This is a great side to have in your Christmas repertoire, because it’s just a case of mixing everything together and baking, giving you plenty of time to do other things.
Prep 30 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 6
1.2kg yukon gold potatoes (ie, about 6 medium potatoes), or another baking potato that’s somewhere in between floury and waxy, skin on and cut into 5mm-thick slices2-3 banana shallots, peeled and cut into 5mm-thick slices4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed50g rose harissa (or use normal harissa, in which case use a little less and add an extra tablespoon of olive oil)3 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped (optional)110ml double cream 80g gruyere, grated 5g parsley, finely chopped2 lemons – zest finely grated, to get 2 tsp, and juiced, to get 2 tbsp 5g sage leaves, roughly chopped, plus 10 whole leaves to finishSalt and pepper 400ml chicken or vegetable stock 3 tbsp olive oil
Heat the oven to its highest setting, or 240C fan. Put the first nine ingredients in a large bowl with the chopped sage and a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Gently mix everything together, taking care not to break the potato slices.
Transfer to a 25cm x 35cm baking dish and smooth out the surface. Pour over the stock, cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the foil, turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and bake for 40 minutes more, until the top is crisp and bubbling.
Turn on the grill. Mix the whole sage leaves with the oil, arrange on top of the gratin, then grill for three to four minutes, until the sage is crisp but still bright green. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving directly from the baking dish.
If you were serving Yotam’s spicy gratin on its own, I’d probably go for a slightly nutty, earthy white such as a white grenache or white rioja: the smooth Muga Rioja Blanco (13%), which is £9.74 on Majestic’s mix-six deal, would do the trick. (And if you’re matching the wine to the main course, it will need enough welly to deal with the harissa – maybe a degree or more higher in alcohol, and with enough acidity or bright fruit to cope with the spice.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christmas puddings: Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chocolate, chestnut and prune cake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Plums are all very well, but ageing suits them. Their youthful bounce, wrinkled into tricky sweetness with spicy undercurrents: prunes are my favourite aunt of Christmas food, eaten from a fancy tin, soaked, stuffed or made into this cake – which came about by mistake. The recipe I intended to follow does not include butter, but habit got the better of me and, before I knew it, 250g of the stuff was melting into a dark pool with the chocolate.
It was an excellent mistake, turning a good cake into an exuberantly good one: dense, rich and thick – especially if you leave it until the next day, when it cuts into an almost fudge-like, velvet slice. Eat with a glass of port and a favourite aunt.
Prep 10 minCook 1 hrServes 12
150g cooked and peeled chestnuts100g whole blanched almonds100g pitted prunes250ml whole milk250g butter, diced250g dark chocolate, broken into smallish pieces4 eggs125g caster sugar1 pinch salt
Put the chestnuts, almonds, prunes and milk in a small pan over a low heat, until the milk is almost, but not quite, boiling. Take off the heat and leave to sit for 10 minutes, then blend to a soft, rough paste.
In a bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt the butter and chocolate, then leave to sit for five minutes. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4.
Add the chestnut puree to the chocolate mix. In another bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar and salt until soft and fluffy, then add to the mix and stir vigorously. Scrape into a 23cm-25cm tin lined with greaseproof paper, and bake in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes, until set but just a little wobbly at the centre.
The cake will be soft and mousse-like inside, so leave to cool completely – at least an hour, but ideally three or overnight – before removing from the tin.
With rich, luxurious desserts, you really need a fortified wine, so look to a sweet sherry, madeira or, given Rachel’s Italian bent, marsala. Try the well-priced Cantine De Vita Marsala Dolce (£11.99 Waitrose, 17%) or the lusciously sweet Blandy’s Duke of Clarence Rich Madeira (£10 Asda and Tesco, £12.39 Waitrose, £12.50 Morrisons, 19%).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nigel Slater’s meat-free Christmas recipes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year’s Christmas dinner will have at its heart a great golden pumpkin, full to the brim with long noodles, lentils and a saffron-coloured sauce of spices and sour cream. There will be a crisp salad, sweet with ripe pears and sour with crunchy pickles; a jewel-like salad of rice, herbs and pomegranates.
The soup-stew can be made in advance and finished at the last minute. Its serving dish – a butter roasted pumpkin – can be eaten too. The pickles can, indeed must, be made a few weeks ahead and can be served as an accompaniment but I have also included them in a salad with ice-crisped sprouts and comice pears.
Nothing will stop me eating the traditional plum pudding, for me the best bit of the feast, but I see every reason to have a few alternatives in store. Which is how I will end up with three desserts this year. A fruit laden pudding; a hot puff pastry tart filled with apples and mincemeat and a festive ice-cream of crimson berries and honeyed nuts. In all, a glittering festive feast.
A large pumpkin is a splendid sight on the Christmas table, but if that proves impossible then serve the glowing golden soup-stew in a big tureen or deep bowl, ladling it out into bowls. I find the easiest way to deal with the noodles is either to cut them into short lengths before adding them to the stew or to leave them long and lift them out with a pair of kitchen tongs.
Serves 4-6onions 4olive oil 3 tbsp garlic 3 clovesgroundturmeric 2 tspchickpeas 1 x 400g tinharicot beans 1 x 400g tinsmall brown lentils 100gvegetablestock 1 litrebutter 90gpumpkin 1 (about 4kg) flat noodles 200gspinach 200gparsley 30gcoriander 20gmint 15gsoured cream 250ml
Peel the onions. Roughly chop two of them. Thinly slice the others. Warm the olive oil in a large pan set over a moderate heat, add the chopped onions and fry them for 15-20 minutes till soft and pale gold. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, then stir into the onions with the turmeric and continue cooking for a couple of minutes.
Drain the chickpeas and haricots and stir into the fried onions together with the lentils and stock. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Melt 40g of the butter in a shallow pan, then add the reserved sliced onions and let them cook slowly, with the occasional stir, until they are a rich toffee brown. This will take a good half an hour, maybe longer.
Cut a lid from the top of the pumpkin, then remove any seeds and fibres from within. Scrape away about a kilo of the flesh using a spoon, taking great care not to tear the skin and leaving plenty of flesh in place so the walls of the pumpkin are thick enough to hold the stew.
Place the pumpkin on a baking tray, put the remaining 50g of butter into the hollow and bake for 30-40 minutes until the flesh is soft and tender. Occasionally baste the inside of the pumpkin with the pool of melted butter.
Cut the reserved raw pumpkin flesh from the pumpkin into large, spoon-sized pieces and add to the simmering stew. As soon as the pumpkin turns translucent, (a matter of eight or 10 minutes) add the noodles. Wash the spinach, put it in a pan set over a medium heat, cover with a lid and leave it for three or four minutes until it has wilted. Turn occasionally with tongs. Remove the spinach and put it in a colander under cold running water until cool. Wring the moisture from the spinach then stir into the simmering stew. Roughly chop the parsley, coriander and mint leaves and stir most of them into the onions and beans.
Carefully ladle the stew into the roasted pumpkin shell, trickle in the soured cream and add the remaining herbs and the fried sliced onions, then ladle into bowls.
A couple of weeks before Christmas, I like to make a jar or two of crisp, bright pickles to slice through the richness of Christmas cooking. Not content for them to appear as an accompaniment, I often include them in a salad, tossing them with sweet fruit such as ripe pears and crisp greens such as shredded cabbage or brussels sprouts. This time I have used them with radishes to produce a salad that is hot, sweet, sour and crisp.
You will need a medium-sized storage jar, sterilised with boiling water.
Serves 6For the pickleswhite wine vinegar 480mlmalt vinegar 180mlwater 480mlallspice berries 10coriander seeds 2 tspblack peppercorns 15mustard seeds 1 tspstar anise 3sugar 2 tbspsea salt 2 tbspsmall shallots 250gsmall red beetroot 300gsmall turnips 250g
For the saladbrussels sprouts 150gpears 2 large, sweetradishes 12mooli or watermelon radish 150g
Put the vinegars, water, allspice, coriander, peppercorns, mustard seeds, star anise, sugar and salt into a stainless steel saucepan and bring to the boil.
Peel the shallots and cut them in half. Peel and trim the beetroot and cut into quarters. Now do the same with turnips, cutting them into similar size pieces as the beetroot. Put them all into a glass storage jar. Pour the hot pickling liquor over the vegetables then seal. Keep in a cool place for a week or so before using.
To make the salad, trim and quarter the sprouts then leave them to soak for 20 minutes in iced water. Peel the pears, core them and cut into thin slices. Put them in a serving dish and splash with some of the pickling liquor to prevent the fruit discolouring. Trim and thinly slice the radishes and mooli. Toss the sprouts, radishes, mooli, pears and pickles together and serve.
A substantial salad, especially one that can be made a few hours in advance, is an incredibly useful thing to have to hand at this time of year. To a pan of aromatic steamed basmati I have added some seasonal treasures, including pistachios and pomegranate seeds. I could have used toasted pine kernels and parsley, or toasted cashews and coriander leaves. The point is to use an equal volume of rice and fresh herbs, nuts and fruits as you might for a tabbouleh – so the salad is vibrant and fresh. You can make this an hour or two in advance but I would be tempted not to introduce the pomegranate until the last minute.
Serves 6white basmati or other long grain rice 220gblack peppercorns 8bay leaves 2cardamom 6 podscucumber 170gpomegranate 1 medium shelled pistachios 60g mint 12 leavesparsley 15gdill 15ggolden sultanas 80g
Put the rice into a large bowl, cover with warm water and rinse the rice by moving the grains around in the water with your fingers for a few seconds until the water appears milky. Drain away the water and repeat, twice, until the water is almost clear.
Drain the rice and transfer to a medium-sized saucepan, add the whole peppercorns, bay leaves and cardamom pods, lightly cracked with a heavy weight so they open but the seeds remain intact. Cover the rice with the same volume of water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, cover with a tight-fitting lid and leave to simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes without removing the lid.
Cut the cucumber in half, scrape out and discard the seeds and watery core, then cut the flesh into small cubes and put them in a mixing bowl. Remove the skin from the pomegranate and break into small clumps of seeds. Keep these in a separate small bowl. (If you add them too early they will send your salad pink.)
Roughly chop the pistachios and add them to the cucumber. Pull the leaves from the mint and parsley stems. Chop the dill fronds and stems and toss with the cucumber and mint and parsley leaves.
Lift the lid of the rice and run the tines of a fork through the rice to separate the grains, then add to the cucumber and toss everything together. Lastly, stir in the pomegranate seeds, mixing briefly, then serve.
A straightforward bit of baking taking advantage of ready-made pastry and a couple of store-cupboard staples. It is essential that the apple puree isn’t too wet. Use very little water and stir regularly as the apple cooks, then leave in the fridge to chill thoroughly before using. I should add that this is almost as good the next day, for breakfast.
You will need a baking sheet lined with baking parchment.
Serves 6-8apples 1.3kglemon 1mincemeat 400gmarmalade 125g, warmedpuff pastry 640g (2 x 320g sheets)egg 1, beatenpoppyseeds 1 tbsp
Peel, core and roughly chop the apples then put them in a medium-sized saucepan with 4 tablespoons of water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover with a lid and leave the apples to cook for 7-10 minutes until soft and fluffy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool before refrigerating.
Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 7. On a lightly floured board, roll the pastry into two rectangles approximately 25cm x 32cm. Place one of the rectangles on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the mincemeat evenly over the surface of the pastry, leaving a 2cm margin around the edge the pastry.
Spoon the stewed apple on top of the mincemeat, taking care not to include any juice. Spread the marmalade carefully over the apple. Break the egg into a small mixing bowl and beat lightly, then brush the edges of the pastry with the egg. Place the second sheet of pastry over the filling, pressing down firmly on the edges to seal them. Trim if necessary.
Brush the surface of the pastry with the beaten egg then score deeply at 1cm intervals with a sharp knife. Scatter the poppy seeds then bake for about 35 minutes till golden brown. Allow to settle for 10 minutes or so before serving.
A Christmas ice studded with nuts and fruit. The idea for which takes me back to the tutti frutti ices of my childhood. I have swapped the hideous glacé cherries for cranberries, and toasted walnuts in honey for a layer of crunchiness. I included a few crushed biscuits too, and suggest you choose coarse-textured, crisp but chewy biscuits rather than anything hard like a ginger nut. So, cookies really. You could of course make your own ice-cream, but frankly we have more than enough to do at this time of year, so I started with a base of very good commercial vanilla instead. It worked a treat.
Serves 6-8cranberries 200g, fresh or frozen caster sugar 100gwater 125mlginger biscuits 75gwalnuts 60ghoney 2 tbspvanilla ice-cream 1.5 litres
Put the cranberries in a small saucepan with the sugar and water and bring to the boil. As the sugar dissolves and the syrup thickens, the berries will start to burst. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. (If you’re in a hurry, tip the berries and syrup into a cold bowl and rest it in a basin of ice cubes, stirring regularly to let the heat escape.)
Using a pestle and mortar or a plastic zip-lock bag and rolling pin, crush the biscuits to coarse crumbs. Put the walnuts in a shallow, non-stick pan and toast lightly over a moderate heat. As the nuts turn golden brown add the honey and leave, without stirring, for a minute or two, until they start to turn deep brown then remove from the heat and transfer to baking parchment or a lightly oiled baking tray.
Take the ice-cream from the freezer and leave to soften. It must not melt. Transfer to a large, shallow freezer box or dish and trickle in the cranberries and their syrup. Do not stir, just run a spoon or chopstick through the ice-cream, so it is lightly marbled with cranberry syrup. Scatter the honeyed walnuts over the surface, cover and freeze for a good couple of hours.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cult Beauty has 20% off all Drunk Elephant skincare - but the discount ends soon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The winter weather has finally settled and it might be taking a toll on your skin.
Which is why Cult Beauty 's latest discount on Drunk Elephant , a popular American skincare brand, has come at just the right time.
The online beauty retailer now has 20% off on all Drunk Elephant products - from cleansers and oils to moisturisers and serums - which make great Christmas gifts for any skincare fan.
Founded by Tiffany Masterson, who wanted to avoid using toxins and the "Suspicious 6" (essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrance/Dyes and SLS), their range is certainly worth the hype.
A great formula for the drying winter season, the B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum is packed with firming and plumping ingredients - including niacinamide, amino acids and hyaluronic acid - and is down from £44 to £35.20.
If you have dull skin, then the C-Firma Day Serum 's brightening antioxidant formula is worth a try and is now £53.60 instead of £67 - that's a saving of £13.40.
Our favourite product is the Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser , which effectively melts away dirt and makeup whilst boosting radiance. It's originally £29 - but you can now get it for £23.20.
The handy discount is perfect for those who are buying Christmas gifts for a beauty addict, or anyone who wants to add a few products to their own beauty arsenal.
But you'll need to be quick, as the offer ends at midnight on December 9th.
Cult Beauty also has 20% off makeup palettes in time for the party season.

Sierra Skye’s most recent social media share has her fans wanting more. As those who follow the model on her wildly popular Instagram page know, Skye is never shy when it comes to showing off her killer figure to fans in some of the sexiest outfits on the planet including bikinis, barely-there dresses, and even lingerie from time to time. In the most recent shot that was shared for fans, the blond beauty sizzled and another scandalous ensemble.
In the photo, the model sat on a beautiful white marble countertop. She did not specifically tag where she was in the shot but it appears to be in the kitchen of her home. For the photo op, the bombshell wore her long, blond locks pulled back in a high topknot with a few loose strands falling around her face. She also rocked a stunning application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipgloss.
Skye accessorized her outfit with a chain-like silver necklace and a pair of big, silver hoop earrings. She put her gorgeous figure on display while rocking a sexy pink, metallic lingerie dress that featured some lace detailing at the top and showed off ample amounts of cleavage. Also on display were her toned and tanned legs while the dress hit just below her thigh.
In the caption of the photo, she credited retailer Pretty Little Thing for her sexy outfit and so far it’s earned a ton of attention from her 4 million-plus fans. In just a few short hours, the post has already garnered over 55,000 likes in addition to 400-plus comments. While some fans took to the photo to let Skye know that she looks amazing, countless others raved over her gorgeous figure. A few more had no words and commented on the shot with emoji.
“Wow I wish we were friends because you’re a real life angel,” one fan gushed.

“You look absolutely stunning and gorgeous in this pink dress hun,” a second social media user added along with a series of heart-eye and pink heart emoji.
“I like that color and material. Looks amazing on you!,” one more fan raved, adding a smiley face emoji to the end of their comment.
Previously, The Inquisitr shared that Skye put on another sexy display while promoting roses. In the stunning new ad, the model could be seen caught in an embrace with her boyfriend while she showed off her figure in a skimpy yellow bikini. It comes as no surprise that the post racked up over 120,000 likes.

Lauren Drain’s most recent Instagram post is proving to fans why she was named “The World’s Sexiest Nurse.” As those who follow her on social media know, Drain is never shy when it comes to showing off her amazing figure for fans in a wide-range of sexy outfits. The blond bombshell is currently pregnant but that hasn’t stopped her from posing for plenty of hot photos that show off her pregnant figure, which is exactly what she did earlier today.
In the caption of the image, the former nurse told fans that she doesn’t always feel glamorous when she’s pregnant but a recent maternity shoot helped to boost her confidence. In the gorgeous shot, Drain appeared front and center, looking straight into the camera with a serious look on her face. The stunner wore her long locks down and waved in addition to a stunning application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipstick.
She put her amazing figure, including her growing baby bump on full display while rocking a curve-hugging pink dress that showed off plenty of cleavage. The bottom of the dress was sheer and lacy and offered glimpses of her fit stems. The stunning number included a long pink train as well, which was seen blowing at her back.
The post has not been live on her page for very long but it’s already earning her a ton of attention from fans with over 22,000 likes and 400-plus comments. Some of her fans took to the photo to let her know that she looks gorgeous while countless others raved over her beautiful dress. A few more followers commented on her question in the caption, giving her tips on labor and telling her how far along they are in their pregnancy.
“Love this..where did you get your dress? You look amazing,” one fan asked, adding a series of emoji.

Suzy Cortez dazzled her fans in a tight peach-colored outfit and a pair of roller skates in her latest Instagram photo, which was posted to her account on Sunday night.
In the snapshot, the Miss BumBum winner rocked a turtleneck crop top that clung to her chest and showcased her ample bust. Suzy paired the top with some matching high-waisted bikini bottoms that flaunted her world-famous booty, curvy hips, rock-hard mid-section, and toned thighs.
Suzy accessorized her look with some red tinted sunglasses, a pair of white knee-high socks with red horizontal stripes, and some black roller skates. She had her long, dark hair parted in the center and braided down her back in pigtails.
Suzy appeared to sport a full face of makeup for the shot, rocking defined eyebrows, a shimmering highlighter on her face, pink blush on her cheeks, and a dark berry color on her full lips.
In the background of the photo, a stunning ocean scene is visible as the waves roll in on a white sand beach. The model called the view “beautiful” in the caption of the snap, but didn’t reveal the location of the steamy new update.
Meanwhile, Suzy’s over 2 million followers couldn’t get enough of the racy photo, and made quick work of clicking the like button over 8,800 times while leaving more than 50 comments in the first 11 hours after the photo was shared to the network.

“Beautiful view and woman,” another admirer remarked.
“Looking so good baby,” a third social media user said.

“Could this woman be any more gorgeous?! Seriously, she is one of the most perfect human beings I have ever laid eyes on!” a fourth commenter gushed.

Suzy is seen shaking her booty in the video as she bopped along to the music she was hearing in the headphones she wore over her ears.
That clip proved to be popular among Suzy Cortez’s adoring fans, and has been watched over 161,000 times while also earning nearly 500 comments to date.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Emily Hutchinson
Beyonce's latest Instagram upload didn't leave too much to the imagination.
Beyonce put her world-famous curves on full display in a jaw-dropping new shot posted to her Instagram account – and it’s safe to say her latest upload whipped her millions of followers into a total frenzy. The beauty flashed her toned booty in a teaser photo on December 9 as she promoted a new collection for her Ivy Park athleisure line, which is set to drop next month.
The snap showed Beyonce from behind in a long-sleeved purple one-piece. The fun and colorful look was an athletic bodysuit with two thin orange strips on both of her arms. The top also featured the words “Ivy” and “Park” subtly embroidered onto both of her biceps.
As for the star herself, she posed with her back to the camera and her booty on full show. The revealing bodysuit wasn’t quite a thong, but didn’t leave too much to the imagination with its high-cut design that stretched upwards towards her hips.
Beyonce went sans pants in the snap to let the top do all the talking.
The multiple Grammy winner wore her hair in seriously long braids that stretched all the way down past her derriere. Her stunning hair do also featured the words “Ivy Park” written out in what appeared to be hundreds of white and red beads carefully placed midway through her braided locks.
Beyonce posed during the shoot with both hands up on top of her head as she showed off her black nail polish and serious curves.
The background was kept pretty simple, as she faced a plain gray wall.
She didn’t reveal exactly what else is coming from her line, though the star teased in the caption that Ivy Park – which is her collaboration with Adidas – would be launching something new on January 18.
Understandably, the comments section of the upload was flooded with messages from her 135 million followers, and they weren’t exactly shy when it came to sharing their thoughts on the hot new photo.
The stunning snap hit more than 1.8 million followers in less than two hours and has already received over 18,800 likes.
“This is fire,” one person commented with six fire emoji.
Another called the “Drunk In Love” singer a “Queen.”
Loading...
“Now this is hot,” a third Instagram user wrote, while another told Beyonce, “You have broken the internet – once again!”
Others simply commented with red heart, shell shocked faces, and eye heart emoji.
The latest show stopping Instagram upload from the star comes shortly after The Inquisitr reported that she sent her fans into meltdown mode once again just last week.
That time, she wowed in a dark green ensemble that showed off her seriously tiny waist as she let her stunning natural hair flow down over her shoulders.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Amanda Lynne
Nina Serebrova started off her week by soaking up some sun in a tiny little bikini while in Miami, Florida. The Bang Energy model shared the photo and a video for her Instagram fans to enjoy on Monday morning.
In the steamy post, Nina is seen sporting a neon orange string bikini as she relaxes on a yellow and white lounge chair out on a balcony. The brunette beauty showcased her ample cleavage, toned arms, flat tummy, curvy hips, and long, lean legs in the skimpy two-piece as she told her fans in the caption that they should do Monday like she does.
Nina wore her long, dark hair pushed to the side and styled in loose waves that fell down her body. She donned a pair of oversize sunglasses to shield her eyes from the sun’s rays as she laid with her arms behind her head looking comfortable.
The model also appeared to wear a more natural makeup look for the shots, showing off defined eyebrows, a shimmering glow on her face, pink blush to bring out her cheekbones, and a pink tint to her full lips.
In the background of the photo a city scene is visible, as well as a gorgeous blue sky complete with white fluffy clouds.
Meanwhile, many of Nina’s over 2.7 million followers were left stunned by the jaw-dropping post, and quickly showed their support for the snaps by clicking the like button over 5,700 times and leaving more than 80 comments in less than 20 minutes after the post went live on the network.
“Orange bikini looks amazing on you,” one of Nina’s Instagram followers wrote in the comments section of the post.
“I hope you have a great day and wonderful week ahead,” a second admirer commented.
“Always so gorgeous Nina,” another fan said.

“Sometimes your posts nearly gives me cardiac arrest,” a fourth social media user remarked.
As previously reported by The Inquisitr, this isn’t the first time that Nina has wowed her followers with her flawless figure. Just last month got pulses racing in some white lingerie as she had her hair wrapped in a towel.
Nina stood in her kitchen and put a loaf of bread to her mouth as she took a big bite with a look of happiness on her face. She also teased that she needed someone to bring her some coffee to go along with it.
That post also proved to be a popular upload for Nina Serebrova, and has earned the model more than 40,000 likes and over 400 comments to date.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Amanda Lynne
Maitland Ward hit a huge Instagram milestone over the weekend, hitting over 1 million followers. The former Boy Meets World star celebrated the accomplishment with a set of sexy new photos, which she posted to her account on Sunday night.
In the snapshots, Maitland is seen rocking an electric blue dress, which showcased her hourglass figure and put her toned arms, massive cleavage, tiny waist, curvy hips, and long, lean legs on full display.
The actress had her long, red hair pulled back into a sleek bun behind her head and rocked a full face of makeup in the shots, which included defined eyebrows, thick lashes, and black eyeliner. She added a shimmering glow on her face, pink blush to bring out her cheekbones, and a glossy pink lipstick to complete the glam look.
Maitland held two metallic balloons, the first in the shape of the number one, and the second the letter “m” to symbolize her one million followers on Instagram.
“WE DID IT GUYS. 1 MILLION FOLLOWERS! This Instagram has seen so much through the years, but especially these last 12 months! We have added over 700k new people this year alone. Amazing!! I have the most loyal, devoted & fiercely supportive fans and followers! I promise I will always give you my best and think of ways to make things fun. Love you guys so much,” Maitland wrote in the caption of the double update.
Of course, the actress’s followers loved the photos and showed some love for the snaps by giving the post over 31,000 likes and more than 470 comments within the eight hours after it was shared.
“Right on darling congratulations,” one of Maitland’s Instagram followers wrote in the comments section of the photos.
“Congratulations much more to come,” another adoring fan stated.
“That dress..love the color and how snug it is,” a third comment read.

“You are definitely a one of a kind, one in a MILLION,” a fourth social media user remarked.
As previously reported by The Inquisitr, just one day before her electric blue dress photo, Maitland revealed that the countdown to one million followers was officially on.
The social media fan favorite posted a sexy pic of herself rocking a long-sleeved black top that flaunted her ample cleavage, and a pair of tiny little Daisy Dukes as she gave a sultry stare and smile into the camera.
That post was also a popular one among Maitland Ward’s loyal fans and has racked up over 60,000 likes and more than 700 comments to date.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019

Kendall's showing off her model body in a skimpy red bikini.
Kendall Jenner seriously sizzled as she slipped into a skimpy bikini for a new photo posted to Instagram. The gorgeous supermodel and Keeping Up with the Kardashians star once again proved that she’s not afraid to strip down and show off her model figure as she posed in a tiny two-piece during a recent trip on a yacht.
In the snap, the beauty – who’s sister to both Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner – wowed as she posed with her arm up in the air to show her fun white nail polish while she soaked up the sunshine with a girlfriend.
The 24-year-old star also showed some serious skin as she hit the water. The reality star stunned in a plunging bright red triangular bikini top that had thin straps that stretched over her shoulders and around her back.
She paired the colorful top with a pair of matching bottoms. The skimpy briefs also featured a thin string design, this time that stretched over both of her hips with only a small piece of material in between. The bottoms revealed a whole lot of her torso, as they sat well below her bellybutton.
Kendall rested on her left hand as she threw her right arm up in the air for her bold pose. The beauty bent her left leg under her right as she showcased her seriously long and toned stomach for the camera.
The model had her signature long brunette hair tied back and away from her face in what appeared to be a low ponytail.
Though she kept her accessories to a minimum for her day on the water, Kendall did rock a pair of dangling earrings in both ears as she shot a coy smile to the camera.
In the sizzling bikini snap, the star enjoyed some downtime with photographer Renell Medrano who also flashed some skin in her own skimpy bikini.
The beauty was lying down next to Kendall on the back of the boat as she cuddled up to her arm with both of her eyes closed.
Renell flaunted her long, toned legs as she wowed in a pair of animal print bikini bottoms. She opted to keep her top half a little more covered than her model friend as she sported a white oversized t-shirt over her patterned two-piece.
The two genetically blessed friends appeared to have a great time together as the stunning blue ocean could be seen in the background while they sped away on the boat.

Kendall didn’t reveal their exact location in the upload, though the superstar was spotted in another bikini in Miami, Florida, last week as she hung out with fellow model Bella Hadid. Both descended on the Sunshine State for South Beach’s Art Basel, and it’s thought the snap was likely taken in the same location.
Fans flooded the comments section of the bikini snap with praise for the beauty, while plenty also showed their appreciation through likes.
The sunny upload has received more than 4 million likes from Kendall’s 119 million followers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australian Model Olivia Mathers Sizzles On The Beach In Cheeky, Mesh Bikini</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Naomi Kennedy
Olivia Mathers is showing off her incredible bikini body again on Instagram, much to the delight of her fans.
On Monday, the Australian model shared a sizzling new snap to her feed that was an instant hit with her 560,000 followers. In the photo, the 22-year-old was seen enjoying a beautiful day on the beach in Gold Coast, Australia, where she laid out across a thin, white blanket on top of the sand.
The camera was positioned high above the blond bombshell as she worked on her already-perfect tan. This gave her audience a good look at her flawless figure and killer curves, which she showed off in yet another itty-bitty bikini that left little to the imagination.
Olivia looked smoking hot during her beach day in the tiny white two-piece that boasted a mesh material and popped against her deep, all-over glow. The swimwear included a halter-style top that was tied in a dainty bow behind her neck, and had triangle-shaped cups that were barely enough to contain her voluptuous assets. Plenty of cleavage was left well on display as Olivia basked in the sun — though the NSFW showing of skin hardly seemed to bother any of her followers.
On her lower half, the Aussie beauty sported a pair of matching bikini bottoms that did nothing but favors for her insane physique. The cheeky number left Olivia’s curvaceous booty almost completely bare, and showcased her long, sculpted legs that were stretched out behind her. Its curved waistband featured thick, ribbon-like ties that were knotted high up on her hips to accentuate her trim waist and abs.
Fans wasted no time in showing Olivia’s latest Instagram feed some love. Within just six hours of being posted to her feed, the steamy snap had earned over 14,000 likes — and that number still continues to grow. Dozens took their admiration a step further and flocked to the comments section of the post as well, where many left compliments for the social media sensation’s jaw-dropping display.
“Absolutely gorgeous,” one person wrote.
Another called Olivia an “angel.”

“Wow! Such an amazing bronzed body. Stunning,” commented a third.
This is hardly the first time that Olivia has dazzled her fans with her bikini body. Another recent addition to her feed saw her showing some skin again in a sexy, black latex bikini that was arguably even skimpier than her look from today. The display also proved popular with her followers, who awarded the snap over 32,000 likes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">High Ponytails: Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid & 16 Stars Rocking The Sleek Holiday Hairstyle – Pics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ponytails never go out of style, as they are the easiest way to just throw your hair up and leave the house. However, one specific style of the trend is the sleek high ponytail that a ton of stars have been rocking both on and off red carpets, proving that it is the ultimate holiday hairstyle. Kendall Jenner, 23, rocked the hairstyle when she was out in Miami on Dec. 4, looking gorgeous, as always. The supermodel looked unbelievably sexy when she rocked a skintight, spaghetti strap fuschia zebra print For Love & Lemons Duran Dress which was ruched against her petite frame. She topped her look off with a pair of bedazzled Amina Muaddi Crystal Embellished Mules and Ellie Vail Gage Oversized Link Earrings, but the best part of her look was without a doubt her hair. She threw her black hair up into a super high ponytail and left the front of her hair parted in the middle, with her bangs tucked behind her ears on either side.
Kendall’s little sis, Kylie Jenner, 22, also tried out the trend when she arrived at the premiere of her beau, Travis Scott’s, 28, Netflix film, Look Mom I Can Fly, in LA on August 27. She went with a retro look when she opted to wear a vintage white Dolce & Gabbana midi dress with a thin white ribbon tied around her neck. Her ponytail was the perfect addition as her hair was parted to the side, with one side gelled back and a high, ponytail in the back secured with her own hair wrapped around the scrunchie.
Bella Hadid, 23, also tried out almost the same exact look when she arrived at the 2019 VMAs on August 26. She wore a full Charlotte Knowles ensemble featuring a tiny sheer tube top covered in subtle yellow paint splatters, which she paired with the matching skirt. Bella’s entire stomach was on full display as she showed off her enviable figure and insanely toned abs. Around her shoulders and stomach, Bella threw on a pair of suspenders, which were attached to her skintight, completely see-through, low-rise mini skirt. The best part of her look though was her new bright blonde hair which was thrown up into a high ponytail, with one side of her hair swept behind her ear and the rest of the pony was flipped underneath at the ends.
Jennifer Lopez, 50, looked gorgeous at the 2019 CFDA Fashion Awards on June 3, at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, when she rocked a bright orange Ralph Lauren outfit. While we loved her look, it was her hair that stole the show. JLo opted for a snatched ponytail with extra long hair, done by Color Wow Creative Director and Celebrity Hairstylist, Chris Appleton. Chris first spritzed her damp hair with Color Wow Dream Coat Anti-Humidity Hair Treatment to create a strong base and add shine, before blow-drying the hair to create a smooth finish. Then, he added Hidden Crown Clip-ins in a clockwork pattern at the back of the head in the same direction of the ponytail. Once that was done, he sprayed Color Wow Cult Favorite Firm + Flexible Hairspray in the roots of the hair and brushed it all into a ponytail. After that, he applied Color Wow Cult Favorite Firm + Flexible Hairspray onto a toothbrush and combed up to the hairline to remove any flyaways, before finishing the look by curling the hair in sections.
Another one of our fave ponytail looks was Hailey Baldwin’s, 22, feminine look at the 2019 Met Gala on May 6 in NYC. Hailey’s hair was done by Jen Atkin, who prepped her damp hair with OUAI Wave Spray before blow-drying her hair using the Dyson Airwrap Styler. Then, she attached Luxy hair extensions for length and sprayed Rita Hazan Root Concealer in light brown to blend extensions. After that, she applied Tancho stick to roots and then used a barbers brush to mold into a ponytail. A little black Alexander Wang bow completed the look.
The Kardashians love a sleek high ponytail, and Kourtney, 40, just rocked one at the amfAR Gala in NYC back in February. Celebrity hairstylist, Andrew Fitzsimons created her flawless hairstyle for the event, by prepping her hair with NatureLab TOKYO Perfect Smooth Blowout Lotion, before blow-drying it upside down to smooth the hair when it’s pulled into a high pony. Then, he flat ironed the ends to ensure the ponytail stays straight and sleek, before putting in BeautyWorks Invisi-Tape Hair Extensions at the back of her head to give the pony length without adding bulk. Once that was done, he sprayed a brush with RUSKW8less Plus Extra Strong Hold Shaping & Control Hairspray and pulled all of her hair into a high pony just in front of the crown, before securing the ponytail with a hair tie.
There have been so many other celebrities who have been rocking high ponytails in the coolest ways possible, which you can see when you click through the gallery above. From Kendall Jenner’s, 23, high ponytail with fresh new front bangs, to Gigi Hadid’s, 24, middle-parted sleek pony with waves, there are so many amazing looks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The supermodel has no intention of leaving the spotlight. She recently made headlines after she and her friend and star of reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kendall Jenner appeared on the beach wearing bikinis.
Supermodel Bella Hadid has put on an eye-popping display after she was recently spotted on a beach in St. Bart’s walking braless in a transparent top. The 23-year-old posed for an impromptu photoshoot against a palm tree and later posted one of the pictures on her Instagram. “Hellz Bellz” frames in light pink and silver from all z angles”, Hadid wrote in the post, referring to her Chrome Hearts sunglasses.
Earlier this month the supermodel posted a video from her recent photoshoot for Chrome Hearts, showing Hadid in a very revealing outfit. At some point in the video Hadid appeared half-naked covering her bust with her hands.
In October, she was proclaimed the most beautiful woman in the world according to a mathematical equation that calculates the perfect face. It was used by artists in ancient Greece and has been adopted by plastic surgeons today. Hadid’s face has a 94.35 percent accuracy making her the most beautiful woman in the world. Second place was scooped up by singer Beyonce, while Hollywood actress Amber Heard came third.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tonight's dinner: Smoky baked beans with cheese and onion toast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A real rib-sticker of a dish. The treacle and smoked paprika give a depth of flavour which mean you can get away with rustling this up quickly for a mid-week dinner rather than waiting on a lengthy slow cook. It's a great way of using up store cupboard bits and bobs. Borlotti or haricot beans work best because they're nice and soft, though butter beans and cannellini would also work fine. Just not the dreaded kidney bean - however long you cook them for, they'll still end up like little bullets. Use dark muscovado sugar if you don't have any treacle. 
Turn the heat up and put the chorizo back in the pan along with the bay leaves, tomato puree, and smoked paprika and stir well.
Pour in the chopped tomatoes and treacle and simmer covered for five minutes.
Add the beans and their water, along with and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.
Taste and adjust the seasoning, and a little more treacle or paprika if you think it needs it. The beans should be glossy and thick, so take the lid off for a couple of minutes if the liquid needs to reduce a bit. 
In the meantime, toast your bread. Spread with a slick of mustard, top with slices of cheddar and the finely chopped spring onions. Either pop the pieces of toast under the grill or top them with another slice of toasted bread and fry in a little butter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hotel Hit Squad: There’s more to Wright’s Food Emporium than the food – not least self-catering cottages perfect for families</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It has been a long and arduous journey but, finally, we make it to the outskirts of Bethlehem and spot a stable. “Think the baby Jesus is in there?” I ask the kids. "Look, the three wise men," says my husband, pointing to a group of gentlemen bearing roll-ups and Walkers crisps.
We are driving through Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire (not Nazareth) – a pretty farming village whose 150 residents are put through the mill six weeks a year by hordes of grockles who have travelled (from afar but unwisely) to get a Bethlehem postmark on their festive missives.
Our own pilgrimage, however, ends at nearby Wright’s Food Emporium. We have been coming for a decade, re-routing trips to the Welsh family in order to bow down before the deli’s altars of smoked meats from Monmouthshire, its small estate and organic wines, its homemade chutneys… The café and restaurant’s Welsh rarebit with ’nduja is a religious experience. And it now has self-catering accommodation that is perfect for families too. It is nothing short of a Christmas miracle.
• The Boulevard Hotel in Blackpool is the ideal place for family fun – and it’s a stag and hen-free zone
I love Wales. There is nowhere on earth so wet yet wonderful. No people who can drink or sing with equal fervour. But even I will admit that its dining options have, traditionally, been more reflective of the weather than the spirit of this great nation. Soggy. Grey. Reminiscent of Iceland. 
However, this is changing, and Wright’s Food Emporium is leading the food revolution. Owners Simon and Maryann Wright celebrate their produce, creating dishes that are witty and wonderful without straying too far from the local soul – bubble and squeak with a poached egg and salumi; coppa with a celeriac remoulade.
The flavours are uncompromising, the atmosphere completely inclusive. Nothing costs much over a tenner. Farmers stomp in for a breakfast sarnie. Purple rinses natter around cake. It is, quite simply, heaven. Heroic, even, in a landscape whose beauty belies its poverty and whose farmers and producers truly deserve a champion. There should be a Wright’s Food Emporium in every rural county. 
And, indeed, for every family. What do you want when you eat out with kids? Really, please get in touch and tell me. The subject fascinates me, since so many restaurants appear to have conflated the experience of “having had a baby” with “having had a lobotomy”.
• Whether you call it a nature retreat, glamping resort or lifestyle brand, Fforest Farm is a superb place to stay
Here’s my list. One: great wine (a must, when your companions are as still as squirrels) that doesn’t require me to remortgage (ditto). Wright’s comes up trumps here. Two: a menu that hasn’t confused the concept of “fun” with “fish fingers and finger food”. Wright’s downsizes adult dishes for children and encourages sharing. Three: an atmosphere that’s relaxed, while not appearing to have been modelled on a wipe-clean crèche. 
Wright’s is carved out of the ground floor of a 19th-century coaching inn, though walking through its rooms is more like exploring a bohemian country house – one long dining table is found in a room lined with wines, fairy lights and vinyl records you can rifle through and play. Turn the corner and tiny tables huddle around a roaring fire. Around another corner you’ll find a bright front room with a red range cooker and cakes oozing.
And then there’s the accommodation. Three-bedroomed Wright’s Cottage is actually attached to the emporium, while two-bedroomed Buarth y Bragwr cottage sits in a courtyard behind. We stayed in the former – opening directly into a bright, modern sitting room, while the bedrooms (all double, one with a cot), two bathrooms and a big airy kitchen are all found upstairs. 
Bedding is from cult clothing and homeware brand Toast (headquartered in Llandeilo, just up the road, where the permanent sale rails are worth a pilgrimage of their own). Vintage chairs and posters are sourced from the Wrights’s gastronomic adventures around Europe. The kitchen is professionally stocked with Opinel knives, home-made bread and jam, artisan coffee and teas, organic milk and butter, though you’d be mad not to have breakfast at the emporium.
• Two small children in a £2,900-a-night suite? What could go wrong? At Rosewood London it all went perfectly
There is only one downside. The emporium is perched directly on a relatively well-used road, with a smart but uninspiring modern housing development opposite. A wood burner and heavier curtains in the cottage would go a long way to cocooning you from both. Still, the wider position is perfect for families. Wales has more castles per square mile than any other country in Europe and a string of the finest are squeezed right here into the Tywi valley. Excellent for the aspiring sprite, fairy or knight in your life. Epicures and aesthetes, meanwhile, are unusually spoilt by nearby Llandeilo.
All this means that the cottage ranks as an eight; the emporium a 10. Which, given that the two are inexorably interlinked, leaves us with a nine. And very full stomachs.Wright’s Cottage costs £120 a night during the week; £190 on weekends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 8 best Christmas wreaths for 2019 (and how to make one at home)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The wreath is a tradition packed with symbolism; in classical times, they are said to have signalled victory, and now they are synonymous with joy and the welcoming of guests.
According to The Happy Gardeners, the word wreath comes from the word “writhen”, an old English word meaning “to writhe” or “to twist.” The circular ring shape is seen to signify eternity, and the evergreens used are also significant, representing growth and the everlasting. 
For many, the making of a Christmas wreath is part of the magic of the festive season (Pinterest is packed with creative ideas to make yours stand out from the crowd, using different materials). 
Those of us a little more strapped for time may prefer to invest in one of these showstopping Christmas wreaths, guaranteed to both impress your guests and give you that elusive fuzzy feeling as you approach your front door on a cold winter's night.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The best Christmas cards of 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When the Christmas card was invented in 1843 by Sir Henry Cole, a civil servant who helped set up the Post Office, his intention was to get regular people using postal services. It's hard to tell if he knew at the time that he would be creating a new tradition that would carry weight worldwide almost two centuries later.
That said, sending Christmas cards seems to be slowly going out of vogue as technology and social media take over, but we're here to bring it back. There's nothing better than a beautifully designed hand-written card being sent to you by someone you care about. 
Read on to take a look at our pick of the best Christmas cards of 2019, including charity, romantic, luxury, funny and multi-pack ones. Whether you'll be sending one or dozens, we've got options for you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Christmas jumpers 2019: Novelty knits for men, women and children</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To truly get into the spirit of the festive season, you need to dress the part. Of course around Christmas time this means getting your best and funniest Christmas jumpers out from the back of the wardrobe.
This year, why not go for something new? Christmas jumpers don't have to be 'ugly' (but they can definitely be funny) and if you play your cards right you might just find something you're happy to wear all the year round. 
Here is list of what we think are the best Christmas jumpers for under £20. At that price, they're all a total steal. We may just have to get more than one - after all, the Christmas period lasts longer than just a single day.
This year, Christmas Jumper Day falls on Friday 13 December. 
If you haven't already guessed it's a day when you're allowed to wear a festive jumper (the uglier the better) to work, school, college or anywhere really, in exchange for a donation to Save the Children.
The charity says its aim is to make "the world better with a sweater".
Celebrities including Isla Fisher, Jon Snow, Mark and Jess Wright, Myleene Klass, Fearne Cotton, Collabro and Natasha Kaplinsky, plus Samantha Cameron have previously taken part in the campaign in the past.
Money raised goes to the charity's on-going projects to alleviate child poverty in Britain and across the globe.
£19.81, Amazon

 £5, New Look

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mulberry announces launch of 'first 100% sustainable leather bag'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mulberry has launched a new handbag, the Portobello Tote, which it claims is 100 per cent sustainable.
The bag, which retails at £795, was produced in the luxury fashion label's carbon-neutral factories in Somerset.
All of Mulberry's UK operations, including its factories, offices and directly-operated retail stores, became carbon neutral in 2019, with plans to expand this measure on a global scale by 2025.
The European-sourced heavy-grain leather used to manufacture the bag is a by-product of food production and comes from a gold-rated tannery.
The tannery's gold rating was awarded by the Leather Working Group, a multi-stakeholder group that promotes sustainability within the leather industry.
The Portobello tote has also been stitched using Epic EcoVerde thread, which is made from recycled polyester fibre.
All profits from the sale of the bag are being donated to the World Land Trust, a non-profit environmental organisation that was first established in the UK 30 years ago.
Johnny Coca, creative director at Mulberry, said the inspiration for the Portobello came from the "ultimate everyday item, the plastic bag", which is "functional, but throwaway".
"The Portobello keeps the beautiful utility of this silhouette and elevates it into an elegant tote that is practically and, more importantly, made to last," Mr Coca stated.
Thierry Andretta, CEO of the fashion label, said he is "delighted" with regards to the development of Mulberry's sustainable bag.
"Through our Mulberry Green responsibility commitments, we are continuing our innovative approach towards design and manufacturing in a conscientious way, ensuring we will provide truly luxury, truly responsible products for our customers."
The Portobello Tote comes in seven colourways, including chestnut, tangerine orange and crimson.
Last month, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour spoke about the importance of promoting sustainability within the fashion industry, saying that shoppers should take better care of their clothes and pass them onto others, rather than throwing them away not longer after purchasing them.
“I think for all of us it means an attention more on craft, on creativity, and less on the idea of clothes that are instantly disposable, things that you will throw away just after one reading,” Wintour told Reuters.
British Vogue editor-in-chief echoed this point of view when revealing Taylor Swift's cover for the January issue of the publication, on which she wears a vintage Chanel ensemble.
“I wanted to put a vintage Chanel jacket on the cover of Vogue because I feel that, with the global climate crisis, we all have to do what we can to contribute to the conversation around sustainability,” Enninful said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Supermarket Morrisons is really embracing the Christmas spirit this year.
It's just been announced that the store is giving away 125,000 free bags of wonky carrots so that kids can feed Santa's reindeers on Christmas Eve.
The reindeer treats will be handed out at the entrance to Morrisons' 493 UK stores.

The offer lasts for just one day – Saturday December 21.
The carrots, which are oversized, misshapen and scarred, but still taste delicious, will be in paper bags labelled Carrots for Rudolph.
The giveaway is aimed at introducing more people to wonky veg and the store hopes that it'll encourage more people to buy it in their weekly shopping.

Carrot farmer Alastair Ferguson explained that a wet autumn has meant they have an abundance of wonky carrots.
He said: "We’ve plenty of standard carrots for Christmas dinner – but also have a lot of wonky carrots."
Alastair added: "Carrots for Rudolph is helpful because it introduces customers to wonky veg, finds these carrots a home and stops them being wasted."
Morrisons sells 1.6 million bags of carrots in the last three weeks before Christmas.
However, wonky carrots only account for between ten and 15 per cent of these.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Morrisons giving customers free bags of wonky carrots to help with Rudolph tradition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Morrisons is giving away 125,000 paper bags of wonky carrots to customers who want to leave out refreshments for Father Christmas and his reindeers on Christmas Eve.
The odd-shaped vegetables - which are oversized, misshapen and scarred - will be handed out in bags labelled 'Carrots for Rudolph' from the entrances of the 493 Morrisons stores across the UK on Saturday 21st December.
The move aims to introduce children to wonky veg and encourage families to buy large, misshapen or slightly scarred carrots.
At Christmas time carrot sales soar - from a typical 450,000 bags-a-week in Morrisons to over 1.6 million in the last three weeks of December - wonky carrots still only account for between 10 to 15 percent of carrots sales.
Many customers have yet to put them in their baskets.
'Carrots for Rudolph' will also help British carrot farmers who have harvested more wonky carrots than usual this autumn - due to the unseasonably wet weather in October and November.
Pulling carrots from wet fields has resulted in muddy or slightly scarred carrots which have fallen short of a ‘Class 1’ criteria.
In addition, some of the crop has grown to be oversized or oddly shaped. Despite appearances, all of these carrots are just as good to eat.
Alastair Ferguson, Carrot Farmer for Morrisons at Strawsons Farm said: 'The heavy rainfall this year has made harvesting very challenging. We’ve plenty of standard carrots for Christmas dinner - but also have a lot of wonky carrots. Carrots for Rudolph is helpful because it introduces customers to wonky, finds these carrots a home, and stops them being wasted.'
Andy Todd, Carrot Buyer at Morrisons said: “We want to make it easy for our customers to enjoy these magical Christmas traditions. And at the same time we want to highlight that wonky carrots are just as tasty as perfect-looking carrots - to support our farmers.”
The tradition of leaving food and drink out for Father Christmas and his reindeer can be traced all the way back to ancient Norse mythology where children would leave out food for Sleipner, the eight-legged horse ridden by Norse God Odin, in the hope that he would stop by on his travels and leave gifts in return.
To revive other British festive traditions, Morrisons will also be giving customers Christmas Oranges for Stockings on Sunday 22nd December.
The oranges will be given to parents along with a story-card telling the history of the tradition – so that parents can read it to their children ahead of the big day.
Morrisons Wonky Carrots are on sale at 50p for a 1kg from all Morrisons stores.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A formerly vegan influencer followed the meat-only carnivore diet for 30 days and her fans are not happy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTube/Alyse Parker
A formerly vegan influencer has divided her followers by following the carnivore diet for 30 days.
Connecticut-based vlogger and Instagrammer Alyse Parker was vegan for over five years and grew her 728,000 strong YouTube following largely by posting about her plant-based lifestyle.
However, Parker — whose account was formerly known as Raw Alignment — announced she was no longer vegan in March this year, and she's recently gone one step further by consuming only meat, fish, eggs, and some dairy for a month. 
An increasingly popular but controversial way of eating, the carnivore diet is considered by some of its advocates as a good way to lose weight and heal diseases like diabetes, arthritis, and fatigue — a myth that Insider's Gabby Landsverk previously dispelled.
However, these claims have largely been debunked.
Having previously challenged herself to drink only fruit juice for 21 days, go a year without using deodorant, and forgo shampoo for a month, Parker decided her latest challenge would be following the carnivore diet for 30 days. 
Speaking in a YouTube video about her experience, Parker said she wanted to inspire people to challenge themselves and expand their perspectives.
"Before starting this diet I was eating a pretty balanced diet including meat and plants and things like gluten-free bread and dark chocolate," she said, and she also explained that she was mainly worried about surviving social situations.
Parker, 25, cleared her kitchen of all the foods she couldn't eat — grains, fruit, vegetables, anything sweet — but announced she was allowing herself two "comforts" — bulletproof coffee and matcha.
On day six of 30, Parker said she was desperate to eat "anything other than" meat, fish, or eggs, and had been craving carbs too. But these cravings actually went away, apparently.
There were days where Parker felt bored of eating meat but she said she never felt too restricted.
The self-described "mindset transformation queen" started out by grazing over the course of the day and consuming dairy too, but a few days in she realized her digestion wasn't great so decided to cut out dairy and switch to consuming just two meals a day and no snacks in between to "give her digestive system more of a break."
"My digestion has been on point," since, she said on day 23, and later added that it was better than when she was vegan.
By the end of the 30 days, Parker said she was feeling "super mentally clear" but missing the freedom of eating whatever she wanted, especially in social settings. 
"The main mental change I experienced was having way more stable energy and focus throughout the day, literally every day," she said, adding that she no longer experienced energy crashes.
When it came to physical changes, Parker said she noticed some fat loss and increased power in the gym.
"I ended up losing around 2 lbs in the full 30 days," she said. "My physique changed slightly but nothing crazy — I mainly just felt more lean and more comfortable in my body."
Having missed eating burgers with buns (and not just the patty), Parker said she wouldn't continue following the diet 100%, but had noticed enough benefits to want to eat mainly carnivore going forward.
Parker has received mixed reactions to her carnivore challenge.
Some praised her for experimenting. "The best thing we can do is self-experiment to figure out what works for us," wrote "animal-based nutrition coach" Health Coach Kait on Instagram.
But many of Parker's other followers said they found her decision "disappointing," "fickle," and "disgusting."
Although proponents of the carnivore diet — which was originally popularized by controversial psychologist Jordan Peterson and his daughter Mikhaila — claim it gives you everything your body needs, many nutrition experts say it deprives your body of various essential nutrients and vitamins.
"This diet is absolutely ridiculous," specialist dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told Insider.
"It's massively devoid in nutrients, carbs, and fiber which will most likely leave you feeling lacking in energy (with headaches) and constipated too.
"Long term it could have some pretty serious health implications, not to mention a poorly functioning immune system leaving you more susceptible to catching coughs and colds."
Aside from anecdotes from carnivore-devotees, there's little scientific evidence to back up the supposed positive benefits of the diet.
"We all react in different ways to various foods and what works for one person will not work for someone else," registered nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert previously told The Independent in relation to the carnivore diet.
"In particular when it comes to diet, encouraging the elimination of whole food groups is extremely irresponsible.
"It is essential that if you are looking for advice in regards to your health and nutrition, that you seek professional advice from a registered nutritionist or dietitian."
Insider has contacted Parker for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A formerly vegan influencer followed the meat-only carnivore diet for 30 days and her fans are not happy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A formerly vegan influencer has divided her followers by following the carnivore diet for 30 days.
Connecticut-based vlogger and Instagrammer Alyse Parker was vegan for over five years and grew her 728,000 strong YouTube following largely by posting about her plant-based lifestyle.
However, Parker – whose account was formerly known as Raw Alignment – announced she was no longer vegan in March this year, and she’s recently gone one step further by consuming only meat, fish, eggs, and some dairy for a month.
An increasingly popular but controversial way of eating, the carnivore diet is considered by some of its advocates as a good way to lose weight and heal diseases like diabetes, arthritis, and fatigue – a myth that Insider’s Gabby Landsverk previously dispelled.
However, these claims have largely been debunked.
Having previously challenged herself to drink only fruit juice for 21 days, go a year without using deodorant, and forgo shampoo for a month, Parker decided her latest challenge would be following the carnivore diet for 30 days.
Speaking in a YouTube video about her experience, Parker said she wanted to inspire people to challenge themselves and expand their perspectives.
“Before starting this diet I was eating a pretty balanced diet including meat and plants and things like gluten-free bread and dark chocolate,” she said, and she also explained that she was mainly worried about surviving social situations.
Parker, 25, cleared her kitchen of all the foods she couldn’t eat – grains, fruit, vegetables, anything sweet – but announced she was allowing herself two “comforts” – bulletproof coffee and matcha.
On day six of 30, Parker said she was desperate to eat “anything other than” meat, fish, or eggs, and had been craving carbs too. But these cravings actually went away, apparently.
There were days where Parker felt bored of eating meat but she said she never felt too restricted.
The self-described “mindset transformation queen” started out by grazing over the course of the day and consuming dairy too, but a few days in she realized her digestion wasn’t great so decided to cut out dairy and switch to consuming just two meals a day and no snacks in between to “give her digestive system more of a break.”
“My digestion has been on point,” since, she said on day 23, and later added that it was better than when she was vegan.
By the end of the 30 days, Parker said she was feeling “super mentally clear” but missing the freedom of eating whatever she wanted, especially in social settings.
“The main mental change I experienced was having way more stable energy and focus throughout the day, literally every day,” she said, adding that she no longer experienced energy crashes.
When it came to physical changes, Parker said she noticed some fat loss and increased power in the gym.
“I ended up losing around 2 lbs in the full 30 days,” she said. “My physique changed slightly but nothing crazy – I mainly just felt more lean and more comfortable in my body.”
Having missed eating burgers with buns (and not just the patty), Parker said she wouldn’t continue following the diet 100%, but had noticed enough benefits to want to eat mainly carnivore going forward.
Parker has received mixed reactions to her carnivore challenge.
Some praised her for experimenting. “The best thing we can do is self-experiment to figure out what works for us,” wrote “animal-based nutrition coach” Health Coach Kait on Instagram.
But many of Parker’s other followers said they found her decision “disappointing,” “fickle,” and “disgusting.”
Although proponents of the carnivore diet – which was originally popularized by controversial psychologist Jordan Peterson and his daughter Mikhaila – claim it gives you everything your body needs, many nutrition experts say it deprives your body of various essential nutrients and vitamins.
“This diet is absolutely ridiculous,” specialist dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told Insider.
“It’s massively devoid in nutrients, carbs, and fiber which will most likely leave you feeling lacking in energy (with headaches) and constipated too.
“Long term it could have some pretty serious health implications, not to mention a poorly functioning immune system leaving you more susceptible to catching coughs and colds.”
Aside from anecdotes from carnivore-devotees, there’s little scientific evidence to back up the supposed positive benefits of the diet.
“We all react in different ways to various foods and what works for one person will not work for someone else,” registered nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert previously told The Independent in relation to the carnivore diet.
“In particular when it comes to diet, encouraging the elimination of whole food groups is extremely irresponsible.
“It is essential that if you are looking for advice in regards to your health and nutrition, that you seek professional advice from a registered nutritionist or dietitian.”
Insider has contacted Parker for comment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Only the bravest of sartorial lions will go for the white jeans look, but somehow Bella Hadid rocked a pair of light denim with a sheer top to the beach – and made it work.
2009 style, but make it beach fashion, we suppose.
The Victoria’s Secret model has hit the snooze button on life as she took some time out in St Barts this week, donning a rather peculiar beachside dress code.
While her seaside comrades would usually opt for the more traditional wear of bikini or swimsuit, or, heck, at least a pair of board shorts, Bella, 23, said sod off to the saltwater norms and put on her most impractical beach threads.
Wearing a white, meshy, see-through halter top, she evidently decided by going sheer on the top she needed to go heavy on the bottom and so put on a pair of white, straight-leg jeans. The kind we stopped wearing in 2009 when we realised white trousers attract all types of unsavoury stains.
She then added a pair of lightly tinted sunglasses that will do nothing to protect her corneas from UV rays. But that’s fashion, we suppose.
The woman was somewhat feeling herself, as she posed up against a tree, wanting to document her all-white, summertime ensemble while she could.
Because, let’s face it, that outfit will stay white for all of 10 minutes before the sand enacts its plans of outfit domination.
Clearly, we do beach days very differently from Miss Hadid.
It comes after she continued her whole ‘life’s a beach’ schtick where she was spotted drinking a martini from a cocktail glass in the sea like it ain’t no thing over the weekend.
Wearing a cut-out one piece – think of the tan lines! – she cut quite the relaxed figure, with her hair swept back into a wet bun, having donned another pair of teeny tiny sunglasses. She then hung out on a paddleboard somehow making lounging on a flotation device look effortless.
Meanwhile, we’re here writing this in the freezing cold temperatures of London, wearing multiple layers underneath a puffa coat and knowing this weather is only going to get worse…
Cheers to you, Bella – you’re doing it right.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liz Hurley gets ready for the holidays by wrapping up as a Christmas present</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liz Hurley transformed herself into a racy present just in time for the Christmas holidays.
The star shared a raunchy snap of herself basically wrapped as an almost-nude present to her 1.4 million followers.
She captioned her post: ‘I wear lots of red but Chinese red, aka Valentino red, is by far and away my favourite shade. And perfect for Xmas.’
That’s a lot of names for the same shade of red.
Covered in only a red satin piece of fabric while sitting on her living room floor, it’s safe to say her heating bills are through the roof.
However, Liz is no stranger to posting semi-nude but classy photos on the internet.
Her fans clearly appreciated the post, with one writing: ‘So beautiful,’ along with a love heart.
The star goes all out for holidays, as Halloween had the 54-year-old dressed up in her best Kill Bill costume and gave Uma Thurman a run for her money.
Last month, Liz blessed us with her skin routine while out in the sun.
Taking to Instagram, the actress sent fans into meltdown with the racy upload, showing her stripping off while enjoying a quick dip.
As. You. Do.
‘LA morning wake up (PS I only go in the sun before 9am and after 6pm- otherwise, it’s under a large umbrella),’ she captioned the shot. And, right on cue, they were quick to flood her post with all the praise.
‘This surely is “How it should be done!!!!!”,’ a fan posted. ‘Absolutely stunning, seriously fabulous, amazingly beautiful.’
‘Love this photo,’ an Instagram user said. ‘That’s why your skin looks so good!!
The next holiday is Valentine’s Day, so everyone needs to get ready for a saucy themed photo, one where she poses covered in roses or standing next to endless love hearts, perhaps?

    <h5 class="mb-1">You can get a Lego replica of your house but it doesn't come cheap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s a truth universally known that Lego is not just for kids.
We’ve seen the colourful bricks in many forms, whether a sports car or a giant advent calendar built by fanatics.
And now you can enjoy the stuff in the shape of your home. One woman who specialises in creating replicas of where you live
Designer Shari Austrian is selling the miniature houses over on Etsy where’s she got some seriously good reviews.
Founder of her business, aptly named Little Brick Lane, Shari offers miniature homes, complete with an interior to match your dwelling.
But her designs are pretty expensive. The mum-of-two calculates the price by charging $1.25 (95p) per square foot (roughly 34 centimetres) of your home.
So a home that’s 2,000sf will cost $2,500 (£1,901). That might sound like she’s making serious bucks but when you consider how many Lego bricks are needed, plus the number of hours required, it all adds up.
Shari pays ten cents apiece and uses tens of thousands of pieces for each model plus extra resources needed.
Some of the higher-end homes can cost up to £3000 (with free UK delivery) while those at the cheaper end are up for grabs at £700.
The idea to make a house out of Lego came to Shari after watching her twins play with the bricks.
Though she started recreationally, when she shared the results of her work, Shari decided to make a business out of it after being encouraged by loved ones.
Shari constructs the houses from photographs and the architectural plans. Each model can take somewhere between eight to 12 weeks
She’s a bit of a perfectionist and likes to add as much detail as possible.
‘I have always adored, collected and created all sorts of miniatures — they’re just so cute. From the time I was a little girl, I was building mini fruits, animals, and homes out of Play-Doh and Lego,’ Shari told Today.
‘I like working with Lego both for the complexity and simplicity.
‘I’m a perfectionist just as much as I’m an artist and I value the clean lines, precision and interlocking strength of the bricks.’
Londoners, this might be your only chance to own your own home.
Or perhaps the only Lego house we’ll enjoy is Ed Sheeran’s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kim Kardashian isn’t changing her Christmas decorations so chill</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have raised eyebrows with their unique interior design choices in the past, but fans drew the line this month over their cheerless Christmas decorations.
However, sources say Kim refuses to add a bit more festive cheer to the place just because fans aren’t loving it.
Last week, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star gave her Instagram followers a tour of her sparse corridors which are lined with cotton wool trees and not much else.
And by not much else, we mean no tinsel or baubles. But, according to insiders, the cotton wool trees are here to stay.
‘Kim is extremely sensitive and she is not a fan of people calling out their feelings about her design or fashion missteps on social media, however, that doesn’t mean she will change anything or do anything differently,’ a source told Hollywood Life.
‘She likes it and thinks it looks cute as it is.’
If the kids like it, then who are we to judge?
Sharing her excitement about the decorations, Kim said in her Instagram video on 5 December: ‘I love these. They’re so whimsical, like Whoville, but all white.’
It turns out the cotton wool Christmas trees were recycled from her Christmas Eve party last year, which was hosted at her and Kanye’s pad for the first time after taking over from her mum Kris Jenner’s annual tradition.
Kim’s interior design choices have certainly been questionable in recent years.
Since moving into the $60 million (£46 million) mansion, Kim and Kanye have baffled fans with minimal furniture and mausoleum feel of the property which lacks bold colours – most of the rooms are white, beige and grey.
Even the bedrooms belonging to their children North, six, Saint, four, Chicago, one and five-month-old Psalm, lack the vibrancy of most playrooms.
Fans were also super confused by the sinks in Kim’s kitchen, which appeared to be a completely flat surface until it was revealed exactly how the modern feature works.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ASOS accused of 'laughing at plus size bodies' with ballerina fat suit game</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ASOS has removed a game where players are encouraged to play classic game charades in a blow-up Ballerina suit after a plus-size blogger accused them of ‘laughing at a body that looks like mine’.
Danielle Vanier posted pictures from the ASOS website on Twitter and people weren’t impressed with the product.
It features a blow-up suit, designed to make the player look larger while wearing a pink dress.
The £30 game is made by Typo but was also being sold on the ASOS website in the UK.
Kate Winney replied to Danielle: ‘As someone who’s danced and done ballet their entire life, it’s garbage like this that puts people off from joining in and taking a class! Dance is for EVERYBODY!!’
Another user added: ‘No not ASOS as well. Why isn’t there one place we can go without feeling fear of being fat-shamed?’
‘You sell clothes to bodies that are parodied in this way and have no problem taking our money. Hang your head in shame,’ someone else said, referring to their extensive Curve range.
ASOS quickly replied to Danielle’s tweet and said that they had decided to withdraw the product from the site because of her concerns.
A spokesperson said: ‘Thank you for making us aware of this. It was never our intention to cause offence, we’ve decided to remove the product from our site.
‘As a responsible fashion retailer we’re aware of the importance of promoting positive body image, so we appreciate your feedback.’
Danielle told her followers that she had been contacted by the team and she was glad they had said they would remove this product.
She added: ‘ I feel like this is a really positive outcome and very happy for their prompt response.’
A spokesperson for ASOS told Metro.co.uk: ‘We’re sorry this item caused offence, it was not our intention and we have removed the product from site.’
The item was also for sale on the Typo website but is no longer available.
We contacted Typo for comment and will update this article when they respond.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Don't ask Beyonce is she's pregnant: 'Get off my ovaries'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Beyonce is constantly plagued by pregnancy rumours every time she touches her stomach or eats a bowl of pasta.
And the mum-of-three is sick of everyone asking if she has another bun in the oven.
The 38-year-old has revealed the question she hates most is ‘Are you pregnant?’ – and has a killer response to anyone asking it.
Speaking to Elle, Queen Bey said: ‘Get off my ovaries!’
Yep, we’re gonna need that embroidered on a t-shirt, stat.
Beyonce has three children with husband Jay Z – Blue Ivy, seven, and two-year-old twins Rumi and Sir.
The star also suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage before welcoming Blue, and she addressed how the tragedy changed her.
The Formation singer said: ‘I learned that all pain and loss is in fact a gift. Having miscarriages taught me that I had to mother myself before I could be a mother to someone else.
‘Then I had Blue, and the quest for my purpose became so much deeper. I died and was reborn in my relationship, and the quest for self became even stronger.’
In the rare interview, Beyonce – who is launching a new range with Ivy Park in January – answered questions submitted by fans, and amidst her answers, the legend revealed that while she hates being asked about the contents of her womb, she brushes off critique of her body.
The Lion King star said: ‘If someone told me 15 years ago that my body would go through so many changes and fluctuations, and that I would feel more womanly and secure with my curves, I would not have believed them.
‘But children and maturity have taught me to value myself beyond my physical appearance and really understand that I am more than enough no matter what stage I’m at in life.
‘Giving zero 🤬s is the most liberating place to be.’
Say it louder for the people in the back!
Beyonce’s full interview can be read in the January issue of Elle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seven blankets to keep you warm when the winter chill arrives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christmas Day is just around the corner but winter still seems far away, as we bask in early springtime temperatures this week.
However, research predicts that the weather will soon be catching up with us, as 2020 could be ‘the coldest winter since January-February 2013’.
In other words, it’s soon time to get your hygge on – and snuggle up indoors with a steaming cuppa and a woolly knit.
Of course, one must not forget the trusted throw for bedtime. We’ve put together a list of cosy blankets that will keep you warm while the Beast from the East rages on outside.
And they’re pretty stylish, too.
This Softly Softly blanket would definitely make a great luxury present for a friend who’s always cold.
However, it’s made from 100% organic and sustainable alpaca fur, which could make some shoppers uncomfortable. But it is worth noting that alpaca is generally considered the most ethical wool to purchase (apart from second hand or recycled items).
As for the feel, it’s pretty warm and also looks nice.
It’s quite pricey, but the quality will be long-lasting – so it’s a good investment buy. Because of the light-weight feel, it will also pack nicely for upcoming travels during Christmas.
There’s only one danger to buying this blanket: that a friend or family member might ‘accidentally’ sneak it with them after a visit.
We’re not suggesting that your loved ones are thieves, but this blanket is so beautiful we couldn’t blame them.
The Silver Bannockbane Tartan blanket is also made from 70% recycled wool from India and 30% mixed fibres from landfill, so you can feel good about your purchase.
This also means that each blanket might look slightly different in colour and design, making each one unique.
It will keep you toasty warm and because it’s on the smaller size, you can also use it as a scarf.
The only downside is that the blanket is a tad itchy on naked skin.
If you’re after a fashionable throw with a Scandi-inspired design, here you go.
This knit and fleece blanket from Zara Home has two sides; the front is made from 100% acrylic, while the back is 100% polyester – meaning it will feel snug, but also look great draped over your sofa.
The cream colour is lush, but we wouldn’t recommend this blanket for households with small children. While it’s machine-washable, stubborn stains will be hard to get out, as any form of bleach will ruin the material.
We like the size, too.
This Tielle Love Luxury blanket is literally winter heaven.
It’s weighty and heavy, and OK it’s very expensive for a blanket, but it also provides amazing warmth – so you don’t have to waste money by keeping the heating on super high.
The faux fur is strokably soft and snuggly, but underneath it has a velvet-like texture, which is ideal if you’re not into getting loads of fluff on your face.
The deep charcoal colour looks stylish against most bedroom colour-schemes, and draping it over your bed or on the sofa, makes the whole room looks inviting – perfect for hibernation.
Warm blankets don’t necessarily have to be expensive, if you choose the right material.
This fleece throw from John Lewis & Partners might appear a bit thin, but will provide ample warmth, as it’s made from polyester.
It doesn’t have the luxe feel of some of the other blankets on this list, but it’s very affordable, so you could always buy two and use them at the same time.
You don’t even need to get the same colour, as it’s available in four shades, including this fetching mustard.
The best part about this wool-blend blanket isn’t the cute, ribbed design or the soft feel – though it has that, too – but rather the extensive product description on the website.
It’s actually made from four materials: acrylic, alpaca, polyamide and wool, and H&M provides details on where these have been sourced, as well as information on the company’s commitment to only work with brands that adhere to their Animal Welfare Policy.
This way, you can decide for yourself if it fits with your stance on sustainability.
We love a chunky blanket and this one from Fat Face, sold at Terrys Fabrics, is just as cosy as the photo suggests.
The ‘trapped yarn’ is made with cotton (58%), wool (21%) and acrylic (21%), guaranteed to keep you warm when it starts to snow outside.
It’s also quite big – ideal for movie nights with friends or a special someone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Super Size Me creator Morgan Spurlock is about to ruin chicken for you forever</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re eating any form of chicken as you read this, you might want to put it down.
Morgan Spurlock, who first hit the world stage for his film Super Size Me where he ate only McDonald’s for a month is back – and this time he’s taking on the chicken industry.
Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken! sees Morgan trying to start his own fast food restaurant using the same ‘health-washing’ techniques as many of the main players already in the industry.
You may have noticed as you go for a burger or some nuggets that you’re bombarded with messaging about ‘health’, ‘balance’, ‘real’, ‘organic’, ‘free-from’, and all sorts of other buzz words.
Even the decor of your favourite food restaurants has changed in the 15 years since Super Size Me was released.
In Holy Chicken, Morgan looks at all these little tricks companies use to make us think what we’re eating is good for us, even when the reality couldn’t be further from nutritious and wholesome.
In a climate of documentaries like Cowspiracy and Vegucated, Holy Chicken doesn’t go as hard on meat eaters. But, it will make you think much more carefully about where you purchase that meat, and how everyone from the animals themselves to the employees that got it to your table are created.
To start up his chicken restaurant, Morgan is forced to contend with ‘big chicken’; the cabal of mega-corporations that dictate everything from what most of America’s chickens eat to how much farmers are paid for them.
He’s treated with suspicion by everyone except from Jonathan Buttram and his family, who take him in and help him farm chickens.
They get around all sorts of regulations in the exact same way the others do. For example, instead of saying ‘fried’ chicken, they say ‘crispy’. Grill marks are painted onto the chicken with charcoal powder to give the illusion of health.
Even the definition of free range is stretched. Where you might imagine is a world where chickens run free in a beautiful forest actually constitutes one tiny balcony-type area of their coop, technically giving them access to the outdoors and meaning Morgan can say that his chicken is free range.
There is so much smoke and mirrors around food that we aren’t told about as consumers. For example, although American chicken producers regularly label their products as hormone-free, it’s already illegal to inject chicken with hormones anyway. They’re using this wording to create an image of social responsibility.
Morgan told Metro.co.uk that he certainly isn’t trying to force people become vegan, just to think about how our food gets from farm to table:
‘We’ve been so blinded by what we’re told that we don’t have a deeper understanding of everything that goes into it. And so by opening a restaurant, that’s what I wanted to really show you.
‘Because nobody’s ever going to give me access to a chicken barn. Nobody’s ever gonna let me shoot that, nobody was ever going to show you how it was raised. Nobody was ever going to walk me through how they market their product to you.
‘So by bringing you into that company and by me becoming Ray Kroc or me becoming Colonel Sanders, you get a front row seat of literally how that manipulation starts from day one, literally until the food’s on your plate. I think that’s a level of understanding that we’ve never gotten when it comes to a restaurant like this or a food system like this.’
There are some shocking moments in the film. When Jonathan first shows Morgan to the coop and they’re throwing the chicks onto the floor, they all flock underfoot.
At one point Jonathan steps on a chick’s head, and you hear it crack.
‘It’s hard. Those little tiny chickens are so cute,’ says Morgan.
‘Like, here you are on day one, and like these little birds are already dying. Some of them show up dead… And then like they huddle under you they chase under you and it’s impossible to not step on one or two while you’re doing this.’
There’s also the matter of the farming industry, and how families who have spent generations in agriculture are being forced to leave the industry because of strict regulations and race-to-the-bottom prices.
While interviewing farmers, they break down, clearly drained by feeling like they have nothing to show for their years of hard work.
It’s hard-hitting, but there’s an understandable feeling in the world right now where we feel like we can’t possibly take on the responsibility of farming, trade, and animal welfare on top of everything else.
Morgan says, though, that we absolutely can: ‘If you’re going to eat meat, you should bring it from a place, buy it from a place, try and support as many places as you can that raise it ethically, that treat the people who raise that food fairly, that get it to your table in a way that is economically sound.’
While it’s not as easy for everybody to eat food where you know exactly where it comes from, we have to vote with our feet where we can, he says: ‘If you can afford a chicken like that, you should buy a chicken like that.
‘Because the more you buy chickens like that, the cheaper they become and more people can have access to them.
‘I think if you’re literally keeping them up for only the Super 1% of the people can by this food then it’s never going to make a difference.’
He calls this change small food (much like slow food, but specifically focusing on keeping it local).
Morgan has fully come for the industry again, and McDonald’s definitely aren’t exempt. He says their food hasn’t improved in taste in the decade and a half since he had it last. What they have done a number on, though, is their spin.
He says their colour schemes and messaging is ‘a bit softer, a bit more kind of fun – everything’s bit more approachable. But the food tastes exactly the same.’
He also says that the worst chicken sandwich he tasted while making the film was the Popeyes recent super-hyped introduction. Morgan says, ‘The bread is boring, the flavour of the chicken isn’t good. It’s this thing that I think the company has done an incredible job of overhyping and under creating.’
There’s also a scene where he called the Burger King chicken sandwich a ‘mitt’ (he tells us he doesn’t actually count this as a chicken sandwich as it was so bad) because it’s so dry and processed it can be worn like a glove.
Add to that that he tells Chick-fil-A to go fuck themselves due to the company’s history of homophobic views and says that their food is only tasty because they fill it with MSG.
‘If your sandwich was that good and that craveable, you wouldn’t need to add this to make me want it,’ he said.
‘And I think that they have created a menu that relies on something else to make me want it rather than the food actually tasting good on its own.’
Is he scared about the fact he’s taken on some of the fast-food industry’s biggest names? Clearly not.
‘What are they gonna do?’ he asks.
‘I’m a little filmmaker. Chick-fil-A is like the least of my worries’
What’s next for Morgan includes opening permanent Holy Chickens, and working with Jonathan as his chicken industry guru.
The thing he really wants, though, is a food revolution where we all work together to make things better for farmers and animals.
‘The more that you can unify people with a like-minded interest, the more successful they’ll become,’ he says.
‘And I think that it hasn’t happened in chicken farming. It hasn’t happened in most of the farming in the States in general because it has been so kind of co-opted by the corporatocracy. So I think that that’s the next push.’
He adds: ‘I really believe that if we can start to just hammer in piece by piece by piece, chicken sandwich by chicken sandwich, there’s a way that you can make that happen.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chrissy Teigen answers all our questions on celebs and their lavish lifestyles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chrissy Teigen gave us a glimpse into the elite lives of A-list celebrities by revealing their secret perks.
The Lip Sync Battle star took to Twitter to complete a Q&A on everything normal people wanted to know about ‘being a super huge A list celebrity’.
Retweeting a fans question asking whether rich people have a ‘junk drawer where they throw random cords and pens’, the 34-year-old responded: ‘it’s celebrity question asking time! Ask me, your favorite A list celebrity anything you would like to know about being a super huge A list celebrity’.
Chrissy – who is married to John Legend – must have regretted giving fans the opportunity because thousands of questions came flooding in immediately.
One fan asked: ‘Do you pay restaurants $ to let you cut the line? Or do they just do it automatically?’ to which Chrissy replied: ‘I make reservations and don’t give them the option to say no. “Hi it’s Chrissy Teigen and id like to make a reservation for 2 for John legend, do you have any availability?” if you just say “hi can I make a reservation for 2?” they say no. gotta say it all at once’.
Pro-tip, if you want to make a reservation, just pretend you’re a celebrity and hope the waiters never figure out you’re lying.
The next fan asked: ‘How the frick do most celebrities travel on planes? Are you ever just hustling through the airport trying to make it to your gate on time?’
A fair question, indeed, because we’ve all wondered how celebs travel without getting bombarded by fans in gross airport toilets.
The mum-of-two answered: ‘There is a terminal a mile from the airport that you pay membership for. they do the same security privately and take you to the plane in a car. I know. I know.’
How much is this membership, Chrissy? We need to know.
If anyone thinks celebrities get to roam around their 20-bedroom mansions with no disturbance, think again.
One fan asked whether assistants live with Chrissy and she answered: ‘We have a house manager who works at the house all day to handle our lives and day to day business, packages, scheduling for household staff etc’.
Not only that, but their assistants do their grocery shopping as well, so Chrissy and her husband probably never have to worry about running out of milk.
Plus, a personal chef helps them with most of the cooking.
As for bills and spending is handled by their very own business accountant.
Meanwhile, the rest of us barter whether a night out is worth eating instant ramen for the rest of the month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Top hotels say guests are stealing mattresses from their rooms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You might think it’s ok to take the shampoo or the teabags from your hotel room, but when does it go too far?
Some people might say taking slippers is too much but we can all probably agree that lifting the mattress from the hotel bed is absolutely crossing the line.
Yet apparently it does happen. A study by Wellness Heaven, a spa and hotel review website, found that 4.2% of the 1,157 hoteliers surveyed have had mattresses go missing.
Of course, you aren’t going to fit one of those in your suitcase or walk out with it through reception.
Apparently thieves have managed to take them using goods lifts that lead outside, moving it in the middle of the night to avoid detection.
The survey found that more popular items to steal include towels, bathrobes, hangers, pens, cutlery, cosmetics and even batteries.
Over 7% of those surveyed reported that guests have taken the light bulbs out of light fittings and 9.1% said visitors have pocketed the remote control.
Some of the more unusual things that hotels said went missing included the room number from the guest’s door and a grand piano.
The Italian hotelier, who owned the instrument, explained: ‘Once I walked through the lobby, I noticed that something was missing, and soon after I learned that three unknown men in overalls had taken away the grand piano, and it never reappeared, of course.’
Another hotel in Salzburg, Austria said that the wooden benches were stolen from their sauna. It was only when another guest complained about the lack of somewhere to sit and said ‘I can’t relax standing’, that the hotel staff noticed the theft.
Metro.co.uk contacted some top hotels to ask if they’d had any mattresses going missing. Most said they weren’t able to comment.
Others said it hadn’t been a problem for them – but said that guests do take some smaller items.
Tim Philips, General Manager at The Club Hotel & Spa in Jersey, said: ‘The most astonishing thing we’ve ever had stolen from the hotel is a TV, and on a smaller scale, we are forever having batteries stolen from remotes.’
A spokesperson for the Rosewood Hotel in London said nothing unusual had ever been stolen from them.
Guoman Hotels, who own The Tower Hotel, The Royal Horseguards Hotel, The Grosvenor Hotel and Great Cumberland Place in London added that they’ve never had a mattress stolen but things like hangers, bathrobes and towels often go missing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Accommodating Restaurant Serves Single Banana Slice With a Candle in It Instead of Birthday Cake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It isn’t always easy going out to eat as a vegan, but apparently one restaurant has doled out single banana slice in lieu of birthday cake.
Twitter user @YazisAlright shared her dessert on Saturday, showing that the waiter brought her one piece of banana with a candle in it, and “happy birthday” written in chocolate. (She confirmed in a subsequent tweet that the chocolate syrup was, in fact, vegan.)
More than 60,000 people liked the tweet, and others soon chimed in with their own vegan birthday cake horror stories, including one person, Logan, who literally received “a cup of ice with a cherry on top.”
Another user, Helena, shared that her friends had put candle sticks in a full banana on her birthday. (At least she got the whole banana.)
It’s been a banana-heavy news week, considering Maurizio Cattelan’s art piece at Art Basel—”Comedian,” which is just a banana taped to the wall—cost $120,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Louis Vuitton x League of Legends hoodie costs $2,420</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Louis Vuitton and League of Legends collection has finally dropped, and as expected, nothing comes cheap.
The apparel seems to be loosely based off of the True Damage Qiyana Prestige Edition skin, with the champion herself appearing on t-shirts and dresses. Pulling from Louis Vuitton branding, all of the items for sale have the iconic flower and star pattern. They also all have a tiger stripe pattern overlaying it on several items. While we’re not entirely sure what the colored stripes have to do with League of Legends, it’s a pretty dope look.
The prices are steep, but that’s not surprising given the usual pricing of Louis Vuitton items. The LVxLoL joggers are $1,610. The zip-up hoodie is $2,420. The dress that looks similar to Qiyana’s is $2,280. The most expensive item in the collection, a leather biker jacket, costs $5,650. With an average League of Legends skin costing $10-15, one Louis Vuitton shirt would be equivalent to ... (does the math) a lot of skins.
The collection is obviously aimed at a very small subsection of the League of Legends fan base that is into luxury brands, but man, does it have me wishing I had more money.
Louis Vuitton also made a carrying case for the 2019 League of Legends World Championships trophy. A Prestige Edition for the True Damage Senna skin, which will also have a Louis Vuitton design, will release sometime in 2020.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Lifestyle Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 1:40:27 pm
Simple yet elegant, that’s what defines the actor’s fashion statement. (Photo: Instagram/ Designed by Gargi Singh)
Dia Mirza hardly ever fails to impress when it comes to fashion choices. She may have been selective with her on and off-screen appearances, but every performance and appearance of hers has been on point and much appreciated.
Be it traditional, contemporary or a mix of both, the actor knows how to keep her style game on point; and this year was no different. As the actor turns a year older on December 9, we walk down the memory lane and take a look at some of her best fashion moments this year.
Mirza looks gorgeous in this striped sari by Raw Mango. She keeps it basic by teaming it with a black half sleeves cotton blouse, and accessorising it with a golden handcuff from Minerali. On the make-up front, she opts for light shades with a bright peach lip.
Trust the actor to ace anything effortlessly, and it comes as no surprise that she looks lovely in this pastel pink satin dress by Forever New. Styled by celebrity stylist Theia Tekchandaney, we like how she chose to style her hair in soft curls, giving it a romantic touch. With a generous dose of highlighter, the make-up, as usual, was simple. To complete her look she wore ballet stilettos in metallic pink which perfectly matched with the outfit.
The actor looks ethereal in this lime green gown with dramatic puffy sleeves from ace designers Shantanu & Nikhil. Styled by Tekchandaney, the gown was teamed up with amethyst drop earrings from Hajoomal. She completed her look with soft smokey brown eyes along with pink nude lips.
One of the reasons why her fashion resonates with a lot of people is because it is simple yet elegant. Moreover, it isn’t something which needs you to go all out in order to make a strong statement. Mirza shines bright in this pastel pink kurti set by ace designer Manish Malhotra which has intricate gold detailing throughout the kurta and on the hem of the palazzos. We like how she styled the dupatta with a golden kamarbandh.
The actor looks lovely in this floral dress from Rahi which features slightly puffy sleeves. But it is the slit and the asymmetrical silhouette that makes the flowy dress stand out. She completed her look with strappy off white heels and a pink chunky neck piece.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From Anarkali to A-line: Every time Karisma Kapoor impressed in a suit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Lifestyle Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 5:50:30 pm
Royal and classy, when in doubt go traditional! (Photo: Instagram/ Designed by Gargi Singh)
Traditional wear always looks graceful and is always in vogue. Whether it is a brunch with friends or a day at work, you can always fall back on that kurta in your wardrobe and pair it with either denims or a pair of palazzos. From college students to Bollywood celebs, everybody swears by ethnic. So it is no surprise that they form an essential part of Karisma Kapoor’s wardrobe too!
Check out how the Biwi No 1 actor nails the suit look every time she steps out in one.
The actor looks like a vision in this gorgeous Anarkali suit by designer Varun Bahl. We like how she keeps the overall look basic by teaming the ensemble with a pair of silver jhumkis from Azotiique. Styled by Eshaa Amiin, the actor opted for basic make-up with a hint of pink on her lips, and hair tied up in a ponytail. A silver potli completed the look.
Kapoor looks lovely in this ethnic ensemble from Ekaya, which comprises of an off-white printed anarkali and a bright purple dupatta with golden prints. We love the colour combination, and how she teamed it with a pair of golden chandbalis. Simple makeup with pink lips, kohl-rimmed eyes and a little bindi rounded out the look.
Looks like the actor loves white, and we aren’t complaining. After all, she pulls it off so effortlessly. We love her in this Surily G ensemble, which was accessorised with a pair of classic aviators, an embroided potli and embellished juttis.
Letting her golden brocade kurta do all the talking, Kapoor keeps it simple with blue pants and sequined juttis. Bright pink lips and a pair of basic golden earrings complete the look.
She looks pretty as a picture in this V-neck magenta kurta which was paired with a white Patiala salwar with  golden prints from Payal Pratap. Styled by Eshaa Amiin, she completed her look with loose hair, pink lips and a golden necklace which looks as if it was just meant for this ensemble.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In 2019, we can't recommend a Red Ryder BB Gun (even if we did find one for less than $25 on Amazon). That said, we do have a listing of 25 products sure to be as beloved by your recipients as that Red Ryder was to little Ralphie Parker.
Hi there and welcome to ZDNet's list of 25 stocking stuffers for under $25. Any of these items would be appreciated by any tech-minded geek on your gift list, so have fun.When we put this list together, we had just two rules (which we mostly didn't break). The first rule is that the gift has to be available for purchase at $25 or less. The second rule is that the gift had to fit in a stocking.We did well with the first rule. With only one exception, all the items were available for $25 or less at the time of writing. Some had special deals, so you may have to act fast to snap them up. And the exception? Well, that went thirty cents above budget, but it's such a great product that we had to include it.As for fitting in a stocking, we're guessing here. The products themselves will all individually fit into a single stocking, but we're not sure about the packaging. If you're a purist, you might have to remove the packaging for one or two of the products we're recommending. Alternatively, you could just set the product next to the stockings, and I'm pretty sure your recipient will be just as happy.In any case, all of these are under $25, many are useful, some are genuinely cool, and a few are unabashedly wacky. And isn't that just how it should be?

This is where it all begins. If you don't have an Alexa, here's a great way to get started. Why not have Big Bezos listening in on your every conversation? Of what value is privacy and security when you can trade it for convenience? 
OK, fine, that's a serious concern, but my wife and I have one in every room, and they're invaluable for controlling smart home devices, helping us keep our shopping list up to date, set timers, and answer questions. Security paranoia aside, this is where the future begins. Get one.
I. Am. Just. Delighted. What is there to say about Spock ears socks as stocking stuffers? It's so meta. So silly. So cool. So... just... perfect. Right now, you can save a buck off the regular $11.95 price. Because, of course, spocks (see what I did there?) with Spock ears have a regular price. This is how you know everything's right with the world.
OK, we'll admit it. This isn't under $25. It's thirty cents more expensive. But the Wyze Cam is just so much bang for the buck that, if you're willing to splurge the extra three dimes, you're getting a product that's one-fifth the price of its many competitors, and is just as good.
If you're raising your kids to know how to hunt and gather in the modern age, they'll need to develop the well-honed skill of looking out for the UPS truck. After all, how else will they know when their Prime shipments arrive? Yes, I know, other companies and individuals make deliveries, but it's a teaching tool, not a simulation.  In any case, here's a toy truck that looks just like your friendly neighborhood UPS delivery vehicle. That's gotta mean something, at least until Bezos replaces all of them with drones.
We don't consider this a stocking stuffer gift suggestion as much as a public service. Now isn't just the time for sleigh bells to ring and children to sing. Now isn't just the time to hang mistletoe and run through the snow. No, now is the time for stores and retailers to rip you off when you buy HDMI cables for your new consumer electronics.  HDMI cables are a big margin in retail. When you search Best Buy, the first cable that comes up is a four-footer for $29. But if you look around, you'll find that they'll also sell you a house brand Magnolia five-foot HDMI cable for ... are you sitting down?... $669.98.  Don't ever let anyone you love, like, or even genuinely dislike buy a $669 HDMI cable. Buy the three-pack above, give one as a stocking stuffer, and save the other two for interventions. Friends don't let friends buy rip-off HDMI cables.
You may not have the premiere of the new Star Trek: Picard show already highlighted in your calendar, but I do. If you have a giftee who loved Star Trek: The Next Generation and can't stop talking about the new Picard show, this is a gift to get. Here's the thing: it's a Kindle and ComiXology digital product, so it won't exactly fit in a stocking. But you can print out the image above and stuff the stocking with that. Pro tip: Issue #1 is out already. If your intended giftee has already read Issue #1, go for Issue #2, which will be available to download on December 18. Disclosure:ZDNet is part of CBS, which produces all things Star Trek. And yet, our corporate leaders tell us ZDNetters nothing. Nothing. Sigh. 
What's not to love? This is a full robotic building kit (from the storied brands of Meccano and Erector), all for under $25. Note that the Amazon page shows the product is normally $39.99, so act fast to snap this up. This is great for kids or, let's face it, get it for yourself (or me). It's a toy you can build from 115 parts in all the Erector and Meccano glory, but it can also be programmed and comes with a USB connector to link it to your laptop. I'm in cheap geek heaven.
I have no words. I don't even know how to explain it. It's an electronic gadget shaped like a phone that uses emoji-like symbols that toddlers can press to talk with an animated dog (bear?) and learn to count. I think. Look, it's weird, it's cheap, and if you have a friend with a toddler, it'll probably go over pretty well, even though none of us adults will understand why.
Nothing says holidays like LEGO and snow. So why not combine them and get your giftee a LEGO Snow Groomer (what most of us call a snowplow)? It's inexpensive. It's LEGO. It's fun with two minifigs, almost 200 parts, and a cannon that fires very small pieces of plastic, so you can step on them in bare feet and let out a howl like you're a Wampa. And speaking of Star Wars...
You can't have too many Millennium Falcons. I was going to skip right over this thing and leave you with just one LEGO recommendation until I saw the teeny-tiny Chewy minifig. I mean, it's Chewy! How can you resist?
This is not a mini-tripod you stick on a table or desk. This is a full size, traditional tripod that you can gift to someone who has a DSLR camera. Sure, it will hold a smartphone, but this is robust enough to play with the big kids. And yeah, you'll need one of those big stockings for this to fit, but do you think your giftee is going to complain if you lean it up against the stocking instead of jamming it inside? Notice the hook at the bottom. I always look for those, especially when I'm getting an inexpensive tripod. That allows you to add weight to stabilize the three legs, rendering the tripod much more steady than you'd expect for the price. This one even comes with a free bag.
Chair cape. It's a cape. For your chair. Did you know it was a thing? I didn't know it was a thing. Is it a thing? I did a Google search and apparently "chair capes" are a thing. This is a TOS Star Trek chair cape and you can get them in command yellow, science blue, or red. If you have a co-worker you don't like and you're their Secret Santa, give them the red chair cape. It'll keep them wondering.
Fine, you want a small tripod, this is the one to get (er, okay, gift). Not only is it small and inexpensive, it can wrap around objects to hold items, and like many flexible tripods, you can even configure it as a tablet or phone stand for reading or watching during those cold nights while traveling over the river and through the woods. This tiny beastie is pretty well-equipped, too. It comes with a GoPro mount, a smartphone mount, and even a remote control so you can take those family selfies from across the room.
Do you want to get an Apple Watch-wearing Apple fan the perfect accessory? Consider this little Apple Watch stand in the shape of the original Mac. It will hold the Watch charging puck, so it also doubles as a watch charger. Your $10 could not be better spent. Well, OK. Yeah, it could. But your $10 could not be better spent on something that will delight an Apple fan. So, there's that.
Without a doubt, someone is going to ask what this is that you're giving them. But if you choose your giftee right, you'll pick that Instagram or YouTube star who is always ready for their closeup. This little light attaches to a phone, laptop, or anything that a clothespin would, and puts out three levels of light. And, hey, if you're giving this to someone with less narcissistic tendencies, it makes a nice pocket night light.
Is your giftee a Marvel fan? Does your giftee dream of someday being Tony Stark? If so, give them this Iron Man wireless mouse with glowing eyes. The vendor described the product as: "Wireless mouse is inspired by the mask worn by the hero of iron man," so raise your hand if you think the design was licensed from Marvel. Anyone? Anyone?
If you liked the idea of the clip-on selfie light but wanted the ability to use both hands while snapping that fame-making shot, consider this AIXPI light. It's a pretty good deal, what with the tripod, phone holder, and light, all for under $25. Our only gotcha is that it's a bit touch and go about whether this will fit inside the stocking.
OK, I'll admit there is an inherent journalistic bias in this gift guide. This is a product I would have just loved as a kid (and heck, wouldn't mind getting even now). Do you know how cool levers and linkages are? They are the building blocks from which many cool mechanical devices are built. Sure, the box might not fit into a stocking (unless -- hint, hint -- you open the box and wrap the parts separately), but wow, this looks like so much fun!
Has your giftee been begging you to get them a set of AirPods? But then you found out how much they cost and realized that as much as you like your giftee, you don't like them that much? Then, my friend, this pair of wireless earbuds made by AIBOONDEE is for you. Like the AirPods, they have their own charging case.  Like the AirPods, they're Bluetooth earbuds. Like the AirPods, they're white. But they don't have the weird droopy white post of the AirPods, and they don't have the price of the AirPods. Even better, they have pretty positive reviews on Amazon and you can also get them in black, green, and pink.
Sure, you can buy someone a mouse as a stocking stuffer. But if you've got a little kid as a giftee, how cute is this? This is a bear-shaped mouse. The only gotcha is that if you order it now, you won't get it until after Christmas. So this is for those folks who are buying their holiday gifts but may not see their giftees until sometime after the holiday. It's so cute, we had to share it with you.
You've heard the adage about getting a chunk of coal in your stocking if you've been bad. This takes it to a whole new level, letting you gift 200 different types of rocks, minerals, and fossils to the budding geologist on your list. it comes with a little display case, a pile of rocks, a magnifying glass, and a guide that lives up to the National Geographic standard for excellent explanation. And, hey, no batteries required!
Wow, the price of smart light bulbs has come down. Back in the day, we were paying almost $50 for a single Hue light. But now, you can stuff a Wi-Fi light bulb into a stocking for under eight bucks. If you want to kick off a smart home right, you can put three of these into that stocking (or one in each person's stocking) and still keep under $25. The bulb that puts out the equivalent of 60 watts is $7.99. If you want 25% more light output, you can also spring for the 75-watt equivalent for $16.99.
OK, here we go. This is a great fit for your favorite stocking. For under our magical $25 budget, you get two full-color Wi-Fi controllable bulbs (no hub required). And, yes, of course, Alexa can manage them.
Proving that there's Star Wars-licensed merch for just about any application, Plox is offering a Darth Vader Bluetooth item finder for just under $25. Is this a good deal? Probably not. But is it Darth Vader and is it a great gift for the Star Wars fan who has everything? Sure. Yeah. Why not? The company also has smart tags with BB-8, BB-9E, Chewbacca, R2D2, and a random Storm Trooper as well. Prices vary, but if you love Chewy as much as I do, that tag is a mere $9.44.
This is so immediately useful, I'm considering hitting 1-Click right now for myself. It has three Wi-Fi smart plugs as well as four USB charging ports. What makes this special (in addition to its surprisingly low price) is that each of the three plugs can be individually controlled by the smartphone app or Alexa. All for under eighteen bucks!
So there you go. Twenty-five stocking stuffers for under $25. Are you planning on giving any of these? Are you thinking about getting any for yourself? And what do you think is my absolute favorite? Here's a hint: I like one item that's useful, one item that's just cool and one that appeals to my wacky sense of humor. Can you figure out which is which? Let us know in the comments below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Louis Vuitton's League of Legendsapparel line is here, and as you'd expect, it is expensive. On the lower end, there's a $670 t-shirt with League of Legends champion Qiyana on the front and back. On the other end of the spectrum, you can nab a $5,650 leather biker jacket or a $2,420 hoodie.
All of the apparel and accessories (there's a $515 keychain and bag charm) combine the iconic LV pattern with the brand's take on a League of Legends color palette. Several items have a tiger-stripe design. As Polygon points out, there isn't a direct connection between the pattern and the game, but it gives the line a consistent feel.
As we've noted before, this isn't an entirely surprising collaboration. It could help both Riot Games and Louis Vuitton reach audiences they wouldn't otherwise. Louis Vuitton already makes apparel for traditional sports, like its FIFA line, and now that eSports have gone mainstream, this isn't a huge leap. The prices might seem high to the uninitiated, but they're in line with the price of other Louis Vuitton goods, and clearly, there's a market for those.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just in time for you to break your “spend less money” New Year’s resolution, Beyoncé is dropping brand-new Ivy Park merchandise in 2020. The singer teased the items in a series of Instagram posts Monday morning. The collection, out January 18, includes shoes, earrings, rings, bracelets, and potentially apparel, although the photos don’t give us a good look at any clothing. The jewelry has a gold Ivy Park logo, and the bracelets (or anklets) feature thick gold chains. There are also Adidas-logo studs, some with thin chains hanging off. The Queen B herself wears an Ivy Park–logo grill. As for kicks, Beyoncé only teased one pair of sneakers with a neon-orange stripe and Ivy Park logos.
This Adidas collab has been a long time in the making. Beyoncé bought out Ivy Park from Topshop owner Philip Green last year and announced a collaboration with Adidas in April. Now, we’re finally getting a taste of what she’s been up to. After we all flocked to see that nature documentaryLion King remake, a little merch is simply what we deserve.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Need a list of Dragon Quest Builders 2 recipes? If you want to build the best base and give yourself every chance in combat, you should know as many of them as possible. There's a huge amount of them and it isn't always clear what they are, so now that Dragon Quest Builders 2 is on PC, I'm here to help give you the head start you need.
When it comes to Dragon Quest Builders 2 room recipes, they'll tell you what furnishings a room needs to fit a given spec. Starting with an empty room—a walled-in space with walls at least two blocks high with a door—you can add extras to create bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and more in return for Gratitude. The better your room fits your villagers needs, the more of that special currency you get. Thanks to All Gamers (spotted by GamesRadar) for the complete list.
Food recipes in Dragon Quest Builders 2 function differently. Cooking recipes give you the edge in combat and can boost your attack and defence stats, plus your resistance to debuffs inflicted by enemies in uncharted areas. Below are all the recipes you can find in Square Enix's build-'em-up sequel.
There are over 150 cooking recipes in Dragon Quest Builders 2, so here's a handy spreadsheet from Redditor ---Blix--- that details all of them. Each recipe indicates the ingredient(s) required, the effects they imbue, and cooking time. Keep an eye out for the ingredients listed and combat will be a cinch; that way you can focus on get your township up to scratch, more on that below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Acai bowls look pretty and delicious, but are they good for you?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Lifestyle Desk | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:12:04 pm

Acai bowls have been flooding our Instagram feeds for years now, and with good reason. They’re photogenic, delicious and healthy. The bowl gets its name from Açaí (pronounced ah-sigh-EE) which comes from the acai berry grown on the acai palm tree in South Amerian rainforests.
Now that you know a little about acai, what is an acai bowl?
These are acai berries at a plantation in Nordeste, Brazil. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)
The acai bowl, which originated in Brazil, is made of frozen acai palm fruit that is pureed and served as a smoothie in a bowl or glass. In Brazil, acai bowls are typically topped with granola, banana and various syrups. The sweeter versions are usually topped with nuts and exotic fruits, while the salty versions are topped with shrimp or dried fish.
Since acai berries are grown so far away, fresh ones are rarely available in India. Instead, freeze-dried powders or purees are often used to create the base of the bowl. These are mixed with a combination of ingredients such as almond milk, soy milk, nut butter, frozen fruit and fruit juice to achieve the desired thick consistency and taste.
This base is put in a bowl and topped with a few ingredients, such as granola, honey, nut butter or fresh fruit.
Are Acai bowls healthy?
Remember to always look at acai bowls as more of an occasional treat. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)
All the ingredients and toppings are pretty healthy, but bringing them together in the same dish raises a substantial issue — sugar. So as good as they look, are they good for your body too?
Remember to always look at acai bowls as more of an occasional treat, not something you’d have as a meal or a hearty breakfast. We say this because, as mentioned earlier, the ingredients in the base are acai puree and other fruits like berries and bananas, and granola toppings. It’s relatively high in vitamin C and fibre, but it contains a whopping amount of sugar.
Many people eat acai bowls for breakfast or a snack, thinking it is healthy. This way, the sugar content becomes even more of a concern. We know that consuming too much sugar has been linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other negative health outcomes and diseases. While acai bowls have a lot of good things going, their typical sky-high sugar count cannot be overlooked.
Can you enjoy an acai bowl every once in a while? Without a shadow of doubt, yes! But you shouldn’t be eating them for breakfast or lunch several times a week. A smarter approach might involve replacing desserts like ice-cream or frozen yoghurt with an occasional acai bowl.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jennifer Whalen Breaks Down Baroness Von Sketch Show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">IFC’s Canadian sketch comedy import Baroness von Sketch Show just concluded its fourth season. Starring, created by, and written by the sketch comedy quartet Carolyn Taylor, Meredith MacNeill, Aurora Browne, and Jennifer Whalen, the critically-acclaimed (and hilarious) Baroness von Sketch Show has already been renewed for a fifth season. This past season tackled poignant topics like the horror and anger that comes with the realization that there are somehow full-blown adults who were born in the late 1990s, whether or not scrunchies are back in style and if they ever were “in style” to begin with, and the most important topic of all, binge-watching.
Paste Magazine recently spoke with Jennifer Whalen, who also serves as showrunner, about Baroness von Sketch Show and the comedic and cultural inspirations that have made it everyone’s favorite Canadian sketch comedy show (that is still currently on the air and led by four women).
Paste: Let’s just start off with the usual question: What are your comedy inspirations? Or as Marc Maron would say, “Who are your guys?” “Guys” can, of course, be “gals” too.
Jennifer Whalen: Who are my guys? Well, I think early guys were definitely Monty Python, and I loved Steve Martin and George Carlin. … Catherine­ O’Hara was huge for me. The first time I saw her on SCTV I was like, ”[gasps] Oh God.” She was amazing. Catherine O’Hara, Andrea Martin.
I would say that later, I really got into Saturday Night Live. The Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph, and Amy Poehler era was really, really huge for me. I think probably I’m going to get off the phone and be like, “Oh my God, I forgot somebody key.” Those are definitely some of the highlight reel.
Paste: From an interview you and your Baroness Von Sketch Show partners did for Vulture, you mentioned Big Train and Carolyn Taylor mentioned Smack the Pony. How much would you say that British comedy is an inspiration to the show?
Whalen: I think it’s pretty huge. I think we’re all influenced by it. Canada, we’re a part of the Commonwealth, so we get a lot more British culture than I think the States does. In fact, Meredith [MacNeill] lived in England for many years, so we definitely have a British sensibility and a British-tinged flavor.
Paste: One thing I really enjoy about the series is that the sketches don’t ever really overstay their welcome. Every sketch is pretty much the right length, even if that length is just a few seconds, which is actually kind of that British sensibility. How important was it to you all not to adhere to a set length for each sketch in order to get to a punchline?
Whalen: Really important. We like to think of it kind of like a mix tape, where you can have some songs where you want to rock out and then you’ve got your ballad where you can slow it down, and so we like to have it very up to pace. We also like to think of the show as each thing is like making a little short film. So each thing should just be as long as it needs to be. And you’re right, sometimes we’ll actually shoot something longer, and then in editing, you’re looking and go, “Well the joke is there. Let’s just tell that great joke and then walk away.” I think in comedy it’s always great to leave people wanting a little bit more.
I think, collectively, all of us have shorter attention spans. One of my comedy gods that I loved back in the day was Richard Pryor, and I recently saw some of his sketch show on the internet and it’s really interesting to watch because, obviously, he’s so brilliant. But some of the sketches are, they feel like seven or eight minutes long, and the time that they take in those—it’s just time that we wouldn’t now. I think we’re so trained by the internet to just go, “Am I interested? No? Then I’m moving on.” I think we, as a culture, we speed it up.
Paste: Season Four just ended, and the show was renewed, so you have Season Five coming up. When you got picked up by IFC, how much of an adjustment was it to move from the six to seven episodes of the first two seasons to 10-episode seasons? Was there even much of an adjustment or were you happy because you now get to do more sketches that you probably would’ve had to cut?
Whalen: It was a huge adjustment. This show, we love doing it, but we wear so many hats on the show. The great part of it is we have a lot of creative control, but we sort of are always working on it. We have so many jobs because we’re acting in it, we write it. We’ve now expanded into trying to direct some sketches, we are also executive producing, and in my case, showrunning. There’s always questions and things that need to be answered, and just the bulk of material with 10 episodes, it was really fun, but we realized that’s the maximum. We could never do more than 10. It’s just too much.
Paste: Have there been any sketches in these recent seasons that you maybe originally cut or that you thought at first you couldn’t include?
Whalen: In Season Four, the “That Lady” sketch was a sketch that originally I had tried to write, believe it or not, in the first season. We filmed it, and it almost worked but not quite. There were some things about the idea that we kept sort of mulling and pitching over and over again. It wasn’t until Season Four that Aurora [Browne] re-imagined it, and we were like, “Oh yes, now we can do it, now we know.”
There’s definitely been sketches that we’ve filmed and not kind of loved and then revisited. Or just ones that we haven’t even filmed, the ones that didn’t make it out of the writing room for whatever reason, that we liked, and then we kind of didn’t quite crack. The bra shopping sketch from this year started in Season [Two] with this great writer, Ify Chiwetelu. She wrote this thing about bra shopping when you’re a larger size and we loved it, and for whatever reason, didn’t do it [then]. … We revisited it this year and just sort of gave it a polish, and it was a really fun sketch to do. We definitely revisit stuff all the time.
Paste: What exactly is the writing and production process like for a typical episode? Especially for you, as showrunner.
Whalen: Generally, if we’re shooting 10 episodes, we’ll break for 10 weeks. Within that … the first day is like a pitch meeting, and then we go away and write our sketches either together or separately. Then on Wednesday, we have the readthrough, and then we give notes and people can do rewrites. And then on Friday, we sit down and look at all the material, and decide which of it we like and want to move ahead with. Or which [material] is great but maybe it needs a better ending. Sometimes, there are ones that we’re dancing around a good idea here, but it’s not quite there. It’s very rare that we throw something out entirely. Mostly, we sort of keep trying to work the material until we get it to a place that we like.
After that, we go into pre-production, where you’re making all the decisions about the costumes, and the hair and makeup, and all the kind of fun stuff. And sets and where the locations are going to be. But in addition to that, we also really like to rehearse, because we find that when we rehearse, you find another layer. Sometimes you’ll be rehearsing a sketch you’ll be in and realize, “Wait a second. This is a funny line I’m saying, that actually doesn’t really make sense.” So that’s an area where sometimes we find real gold and magic and part of the dynamics and adding a new layer.
And then we go to shoot. When we’re shooting, the days are long, but we have a lot of fun and we generally get the sketch to script, but we also improvise. So we’ll improvise a lot in the top and the bottom, and it’ll be funny because we really know the material by that time, because we’ve been with it in the writing room, rehearsing and stuff. And it’s really funny how sometimes you will be in the scene, in the moment, and you’re like, “I know what the ending of this thing is.” And then, you can improvise a line that ties it all up, which is really satisfying. So that’s really fun
Then once that’s all done, we go into the edit suite and we divide the sketches into quarters and everyone has their own, which they can make creative decisions over. And as showrunner, I oversee that. Then we edit it, so we all have a hand in that. That’s really been invaluable because it’s just a whole other skill. Usually if you’re a writer or an actor, you’re not allowed in the edit suite. It’s like, “What’s behind the curtain?” Editing is—you can make or break a sketch in it. So it’s amazing, and it’s been such a great learning experience. It’s made me, I think, a better writer and a better actor, being able to be in the edit suite. So, that’s really fun.
And then once that’s done, we fall apart, we rest for a minute, and then we start all over again.
Paste: All four of you play a range of characters, but are there any specific characters or bits that you personally prefer to play? My particular favorite sketch focused on you is “You’re Denver Now” from Season Three.
Whalen: Oh, thank you. I loved it. I love it too. Being Denver was fun. It was kind of hard to put her back in the box. I thought I wouldn’t be into all of the contouring. But the minute I took a selfie, I was like, “Oh, this is why people do this. Oh wow.” I couldn’t stop taking pictures of myself. It was crazy. I love her.
I actually really enjoy when we do office scenes, because often those ones that are really a combo of the four of us, and there’ll be times where you just have a line or two and those characters I really like. There’s a sketch in Season Four about, “Did you like the thing I posted on Facebook trying to cheer you up?” I’m just in the background, and decided on the day I saw my costume, I thought, “I want my office lady to have a cold.” And so I just had a good time pretending to have a cold. That’s just a little thing that most people wouldn’t notice, but I love that. I think in Season Four, one of my favorite characters to play is the mad wife in this sort of Bronte parody. I always loved Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights as a kid, so that was really fun to get to be a mad wife. Anytime you get to be crazy, which I mean, Denver is kind of crazy as well.
Paste: A different kind of crazy.
Whalen: Yeah.
Paste: Do you ever notice the States audiences reacting differently from Canadian audience to certain sketches? Not even Canada-specific sketches, because the Hamilton/Toronto sketch this season was pretty relatable, even if you’re not in Canada—just understanding when your friends go to the suburbs and that commute. But do you ever notice that there are some times when Americans really gravitate to a certain sketch that Canadians for some reason didn’t? Or vice versa?
Whalen: Yeah, it does shift slightly, and it’s interesting. It’s like there are some ones that everybody agrees on, but there will be ones that, and I’m sorry I’m not able to pick out a specific one for you, but there will be ones that do better in the States and ones that do better in Canada. And then there’s just ones that somebody, somewhere on the internet will find, and it’ll be a sketch that we worked on that we’ve kind of forgotten about but will come back because some segment of the population that has an interest in whatever the sketch is about, will start sharing it around and then it’ll come back and people will get it. It’s weird, it’s really fun.
Paste: Do you ever find yourself worrying about having to play to the two separate audiences? Or are you just still thinking, “We’ll do what we think is funny?”
Whalen: You’re exactly right. We just do what we think is funny. I don’t think we really think about the audience other than trying to make an entertaining show. … We don’t think about the audience in terms of, “Will they think this or won’t they?” We really just try and make a show that we think is funny and that we think would be a fun show to watch. That’s sort of how we attack it. I think it would be too hard, I think if you start thinking about what people are going to like. I think it’s a slippery slope because people are all so different.
Paste: One thing I noted when I was writing about Season Four is that the series is very good not to fall down the rabbit hole of being too exclusionary or “white feminist-y.” In fact, it kind of actually mocks all of that. How cognizant were all four of you of that aspect of the show? And how important is it to you to be more intersectional and inclusive in the show’s comedy?
Whalen: Oh it’s really important to us. When I started my comedy career, I was kind of always the only woman in a room full of men. That kind of exclusion, like excluding half of the population because of their sex. Like when you think about if it’s going to be six guys who are getting a job and one woman, the economics of that is crazy. And then if you broaden that out to people who are not getting in those rooms because of the color of the skin, if they have a disability, because of their sexual orientation, because of any difference, that isn’t right. And I also think our culture is richer when we hear everybody’s voice, it’s more interesting.
We’ve heard it from one point of view for a really long time. I think it’s really interesting and valid and great to hear what everybody is feeling. I think it makes us better humans. As I said, I think it’s more interesting. I think it is hugely important to us and we are aware that we’re four white women in our forties and that it’s really important to us to try and bring in as much diversity as we can. And also to be open to new ideas. We love looking [and asking], “Where are our blind spots?” We love to do sketches where it’s hard to know who’s right and who’s wrong because I think, one of the things that I delight in, is the things when you catch yourself in a hypocrisy that you weren’t aware of. Because I think we all have those areas. You like to think that you’re on the right side of everything and then you’re like, “Oh wait a minute.” Somebody points out to you, “Hey you, have you considered this perspective?” And you’re like, “Oh no. I didn’t. And I didn’t even realize that I was doing that.” So I think that’s a really interesting area to play into.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The best pre-lit artificial Christmas trees, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Growing up on a farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains, our Christmas tree came straight from our woods, or if there wasn’t a good candidate that year, we bought from a Christmas tree farm.
That magical experience waned when I moved farther south where the weather could be 80 degrees as I picked out a semi-live tree from a lot and tried to secure it to the top of a compact car. The final death knell rang the year I could not get the tree into the stand and ended up trying to whittle the trunk with a screwdriver and a hammer. It was time to move to an artificial tree I could manage.
My first artificial tree rang true to its name. It looked fake from even 3 miles away. Fortunately, tree designers and manufacturers have gotten better at producing more realistic branches and needles. I’ve gotten savvier at selecting trees and have settled on the proper height and circumference for my living space.
After a few years of attempting to wrangle lights onto my artificial tree, I opted for a pre-lit tree. With the selections offered today, you can have lights of any color, special effects ranging from flashing to dimming to changing colors. It is important to look for a pre-lit tree that is labeled “with burn-out protection” or “continuous on.” This means that if one bulb goes out, the rest of the strand will stay lit.
After going through a series of trees, I’ve gained a bit of knowledge that allows me to help others make a good decision when buying a pre-lit artificial tree:
I have seen and researched many pre-lit artificial trees over the years. I’m always looking for the most beautiful, easiest to assemble, and the best value in products for myself and others.
Updated on 12/09/2019 by Lisa Sabatini: Updated prices and links. Replaced out-of-stock products.
Even if you’ve never been to Colorado, you’ll love their state tree, the blue spruce, with its blue-green, light grey, and moss green needles. Balsam Hill captured the majesty in their Classic Blue Spruce Pre-lit LED Artificial Christmas Tree. The 7-foot height (without a tree topper) and 53-inch width are perfect for a statement tree in your home.
Balsam Hill trees are exceptionally realistic because they have so many branch tips that can be fluffed and spread to create fullness. The PVC needles are soft, pliable, and flat just like real spruce needles. The sturdy branches are hinged for quick and easy setup.
My favorite feature is the lights. While many LED clear lights are dazzlingly bright, Balsam Hill uses Candlelight LED bulbs that cast a soft glow more like an incandescent bulb. There are 850 hand-strung lights attached to the branches. The tree comes with extra bulbs and fuses, and the lights are designed to be continuously on if one bulb on a strand goes out.
The tree comes with a tree stand with rubber, scratch-proof feet, storage bags, and my favorite, an on/off foot pedal so you don’t have to crawl under the tree every night to unplug it.
With the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, more than 700 reviews on Amazon, and a 4.5-star overall rating, clearly, this tree is more than worthy of our top pick.
Pros: Easy assembly, 2,366 branch tips, 850 LED lights, realistic color and needles, 3-year limited warranty
Cons: Time must be spent to spread and fluff the branches to achieve fullness
There are spaces like entryways, tight corners, and small apartments where a wide Christmas tree just won’t work. Most artificial trees come in full, slim, or pencil widths. The Puleo International Slim Fraser Fir Pre-Lit Artificial Tree stands at 7.5 feet tall and gives the illusion of a wide, full tree but in a slender 42-inch diameter.
When a friend moved from a large home into a patio home, her previous tree just wouldn’t work in the living room unless everyone wanted to stand around the tree for the entire season because there was no room for chairs. So we went shopping for a more slender tree. Pencil trees just didn’t offer enough branches to accommodate her favorite ornaments, but this slim Puleo International Fraser Fir Artificial Tree was perfect.
The 7.5-foot tree is pre-strung with 500 lights and has 1,453 branch tips to create the illusion of a wider, full tree. The tree is simple to assemble with just three sections to put together. The included tree stand is sturdy and the lights are soft white, UL-listed. The lights are “continuous on” so that if one bulb goes out, the others stay on.
Pros: 500 lights, 1,453 branch tips, 5-year warranty for tree, 2-year warranty for lights
Cons: Lights are not LED, no storage bag included
This charming tree looks like you just brought it in from the snowy woods. But the benefit of a flocked artificial tree dusted with snow is that it won’t melt and leave puddles on your floor. When I was growing up, we added a wintry-touch to live trees with a can of spray-on snow. I can tell you it was quite messy, and cleaning the floor was not simple. So when I discovered this Lexington Pine snow-flocked pre-lit tree, I love that I could have the look without the extra effort and mess.
Standing 7.5 feet tall, this pine is pre-strung with 500 LED lights in a warm white. The 1,254 branch tips are accented with flocked pine cones to add to the natural, woodsy look. There’s still plenty of room for your ornaments and maybe a red bird or two peeping out of the branches. The medium width of 48 inches is perfect for most spaces
The tree sets up quickly because the plugs for each section of lighted branches are located inside the tree pole, or trunk. As you add each section, the lights illuminate automatically as you connect the plugs. The tree features an on/off foot pedal for convenience, and extra lights and fuses are included.
With nearly 250 reviews on The Home Depot, the tree has a rating of 4.6 stars. Many reviewers said they loved the natural look so much that they didn’t even add decorations.
Pros: 7.5 feet tall, 1,254 branch tips, 500 LED pre-strung lights, sprinkled with pine cones, foot pedal for light control
Cons: Flocking can shed during setup
The first silver tree I ever saw was in my aunt’s living room. It was almost like a needleless tree with silver pom-poms at the end of every branch. I was mesmerized with its ever-changing colors as the separate rotating light wheel turned it from red to blue to silver. It was like celebrating Christmas with the Jetsons.
The Wondershop Silver Tinsel Alberta Spruce Tree is shaped like a natural spruce tree, but it still holds the allure of a dazzling tree. Just like its green counterparts, a tinsel tree is made from PVC plastic that has been coated to give the needles their shimmer. And with 210 pre-strung incandescent clear lights, this one is a showstopper.
The tree is 6 feet tall with a slender 27-inch diameter and weighs just 10 pounds making it simple to assemble. The tree comes with a four-point tree stand and has pull down branches. There are 520 branch tips to fluff out and hold all of your favorite ornaments.
If you want a fashion-forward holiday, use only one color of ornaments for a stylized effect. Or silver trees are great for highlighting antique ornaments, especially fragile mercury glass pieces. Either way, you’ll be smiling each time you use the foot control to turn on and off the lights.
Pros: 6-foot slender silhouette, 210 pre-strung lights, 520 branch tips, tree stand included
Cons: No storage bag is included
If you are looking for a pre-lit artificial tree that delivers a decorating punch but won’t break the bank, the 7-foot Gymax Pre-Lit Tree from Walmart is a perfect choice. I was amazed when I first saw this tree and heard the price. The tree has 300 warm white LED lights and 1,438 branch tips that create fullness.
The tree comes with a high-density metal stand for support and three sections of hinged branches and has a full silhouette at 49 inches. That’s plenty of room under the tree for a train set or lots of presents. At 7 feet, this tree is large enough for an office or public gathering space and will hold dozens of ornaments.
I was pleased with the enhanced top of the tree that is sturdy enough to hold your favorite tree topper without drooping. The branches are spruce-like and fluff out easily. This is a good looking tree at a bargain price.
Pros: 7 feet tall, 300 pre-strung LED lights, 1,096 branch tips, sturdy, easy-to-assemble
Cons: No foot-control for lights, a storage bag is not included

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Between your family, friends, partners, friends’ partners, co-workers, dog walker, and the barista who knows your coffee order, holiday gifting can add up – especially if you’re tempted to treat everyone.
We’ll never tell you not to splurge on a great gift, but if you’re looking for something more affordable, we’ve rounded up 30 beauty gifts all under $25. They’re even ordered from low to high so you can shop within your budget.
The next best thing to a cup of coffee, this caffeine-infused face mask will help exfoliate and wake up their complexion even as they wind down with “The Mandalorian” on Disney Plus.
These cotton wipes are made with olive oil and aloe to help remove waterproof makeup and hydrate delicate skin at the same time. The resealable packaging helps prevent the wipes from drying out.
It’s a scientific fact that they can never have too many lip balms. They’ll love opening this festive set and will love rediscovering them again in their coat pockets or bottoms of their tote bags next week.
No matter if you choose between the deep pink or classic red shade (or both), this affordable lip stain leaves behind vibrant color and a hydrating finish thanks to the rosehip, argan, and jojoba oils.
They can channel their inner Elsa with this red lipstick; the blue bullet is emblazoned with frozen fractals all around.
They can slip these self-warming masks on and relax while the treatment soothes and smoothes for baby-soft hands.
I have a few of these liquid lipsticks and I love every single shade, though Rose Nude (included in this set) is my favorite for the soft my-lips-but-better shade. The texture is like almost mousse-like and the demi-matte finish doesn’t dry out my lips either.
This temporary, spray-on rose gold hair tint will make them look like they walked off the set of a fantasy movie.
Formulated with a heavy-duty combo of shea butter, jojoba oil, and olive oil, the price tag will give you sticker shock in the best way possible.
This hand cream is crafted with hydrating rosehip oil, nourishing vitamins A and E, and soothing aloe – meaning their hands will be super grateful every time they use it.
Help maximize their sleep with this little aromatherapy set. One is a lavender, vetivert, and chamomile pillow spray that helps calm and relax, while the other is a eucalyptus, frankincense, and lavender rollerball that helps encourage mindfulness and clear breathing.
This set has everything they’d need to finish their beauty look, from primer to setting spray.
I’ve been using the OG Smith’s Rosebud for more than a decade and it’s never failed to moisturize my lips, soothe windburned hands, smooth baby hairs, and more. This set comes with the original as well as a mint and a strawberry version.
This lip print makeup bag doubles as a fun clutch. If it gets marked up with stray lipstick or eyeliner, just toss it in the washing machine and it’ll come out looking like new.
They can use the firming or brightening serums on their own or with the included roller. It’s an easy way to destress and decompress while catching up on Disney Plus.
Gel nail polish lasts longer than the traditional ones, meaning they don’t have to waste time doing their nails every three days. This set includes a creamy nude and a shimmery pink that can be worn solo, layered, or used together in a cool design.
Blend, shade, and sculpt with these eye makeup brushes. One of them even comes with a handy spoolie brush for lashes and brows, and everything fits inside the sleek zippered pouch.
The conical shape of this makeup blender makes it a versatile tool for any kind of look. The longer side is ideal for hard-to-reach areas like the inner corners of your eyes or around the nose while the shorter is great for foundation and blush.
This travel-friendly trio of Tarte’s popular eyeliners is an impressive value; you might want to get a set for yourself too. The eyeliners come in three wearable shades – black, brown, and a dark burgundy that looks basically like brown – and they’re double-ended too with a gel formula on one side and a liquid on the other.
Each set comes with a gemstone-shaped cleanser and a BeautyBlender, but they won’t know the color of the actual sponge until they open the present. Half the fun of gifting this is figuring out which color BeautyBlender is inside.
If they collect lipsticks like it’s their job, they’ll love this customizable Guerlain lipstick case. It’s a magnetic and mirrored case that fits the brand’s iconic Rouge G lipsticks and comes in 24 different colors and textures.
If they love NARS’s flattering Dolce Vita makeup shade, they’ll love this duo. It even comes in a gold firecracker packaging so it’s ready for gifting.
This dry shampoo duo absorbs and removes oil, sweat, and odor so they can sleep in for a few more minutes instead of washing their second-day hair.
Help streamline their beauty routine with these multi-purpose lip and cheek pencils in three flattering shades.
Pair the top-rated fiber mascara with any of the 14 different gel eyeliners for a customized gift that matches their vibe.
Save yourself the trouble of figuring out what perfume they might like with a sampler set like this. It has eight mini sprays so they can find their new favorite.
Just add water to these cloths and watch them remove even waterproof mascara with ease – it might as well be magic.
These silk scrunchies will look a lot chicer on their wrists than their usual black hair tie. The cute ball ornament houses four scrunchies that’ll go with any outfit.
Tide them over until they can get to their hairstylist with a trio of reparative hair-care products. This set even comes in a zippered canvas pouch they can use for traveling too.
If they’re traveling during the holidays, this mini cleanser and mask duo is a great TSA-friendly set. It includes a cream-to-oil cleanser made with floral ingredients and packed with antioxidants, and the mask is formulated with Spanish clay to decongest pores and tighten skin.

    <h5 class="mb-1">30 beauty gifts under $25 — including Le Labo lip balms, customizable Glossier sets, Givenchy makeup sponges, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Between your family, friends, partners, friends’ partners, co-workers, dog walker, and the barista who knows your coffee order, holiday gifting can add up – especially if you’re tempted to treat everyone.
We’ll never tell you not to splurge on a great gift, but if you’re looking for something more affordable, we’ve rounded up 30 beauty gifts all under $25. They’re even ordered from low to high so you can shop within your budget.
The next best thing to a cup of coffee, this caffeine-infused face mask will help exfoliate and wake up their complexion even as they wind down with “The Mandalorian” on Disney Plus.
These cotton wipes are made with olive oil and aloe to help remove waterproof makeup and hydrate delicate skin at the same time. The resealable packaging helps prevent the wipes from drying out.
It’s a scientific fact that they can never have too many lip balms. They’ll love opening this festive set and will love rediscovering them again in their coat pockets or bottoms of their tote bags next week.
No matter if you choose between the deep pink or classic red shade (or both), this affordable lip stain leaves behind vibrant color and a hydrating finish thanks to the rosehip, argan, and jojoba oils.
They can channel their inner Elsa with this red lipstick; the blue bullet is emblazoned with frozen fractals all around.
They can slip these self-warming masks on and relax while the treatment soothes and smoothes for baby-soft hands.
I have a few of these liquid lipsticks and I love every single shade, though Rose Nude (included in this set) is my favorite for the soft my-lips-but-better shade. The texture is like almost mousse-like and the demi-matte finish doesn’t dry out my lips either.
This temporary, spray-on rose gold hair tint will make them look like they walked off the set of a fantasy movie.
Formulated with a heavy-duty combo of shea butter, jojoba oil, and olive oil, the price tag will give you sticker shock in the best way possible.
This hand cream is crafted with hydrating rosehip oil, nourishing vitamins A and E, and soothing aloe – meaning their hands will be super grateful every time they use it.
Help maximize their sleep with this little aromatherapy set. One is a lavender, vetivert, and chamomile pillow spray that helps calm and relax, while the other is a eucalyptus, frankincense, and lavender rollerball that helps encourage mindfulness and clear breathing.
This set has everything they’d need to finish their beauty look, from primer to setting spray.
I’ve been using the OG Smith’s Rosebud for more than a decade and it’s never failed to moisturize my lips, soothe windburned hands, smooth baby hairs, and more. This set comes with the original as well as a mint and a strawberry version.
This lip print makeup bag doubles as a fun clutch. If it gets marked up with stray lipstick or eyeliner, just toss it in the washing machine and it’ll come out looking like new.
They can use the firming or brightening serums on their own or with the included roller. It’s an easy way to destress and decompress while catching up on Disney Plus.
Gel nail polish lasts longer than the traditional ones, meaning they don’t have to waste time doing their nails every three days. This set includes a creamy nude and a shimmery pink that can be worn solo, layered, or used together in a cool design.
Blend, shade, and sculpt with these eye makeup brushes. One of them even comes with a handy spoolie brush for lashes and brows, and everything fits inside the sleek zippered pouch.
The conical shape of this makeup blender makes it a versatile tool for any kind of look. The longer side is ideal for hard-to-reach areas like the inner corners of your eyes or around the nose while the shorter is great for foundation and blush.
This travel-friendly trio of Tarte’s popular eyeliners is an impressive value; you might want to get a set for yourself too. The eyeliners come in three wearable shades – black, brown, and a dark burgundy that looks basically like brown – and they’re double-ended too with a gel formula on one side and a liquid on the other.
Each set comes with a gemstone-shaped cleanser and a BeautyBlender, but they won’t know the color of the actual sponge until they open the present. Half the fun of gifting this is figuring out which color BeautyBlender is inside.
If they collect lipsticks like it’s their job, they’ll love this customizable Guerlain lipstick case. It’s a magnetic and mirrored case that fits the brand’s iconic Rouge G lipsticks and comes in 24 different colors and textures.
If they love NARS’s flattering Dolce Vita makeup shade, they’ll love this duo. It even comes in a gold firecracker packaging so it’s ready for gifting.
This dry shampoo duo absorbs and removes oil, sweat, and odor so they can sleep in for a few more minutes instead of washing their second-day hair.
Help streamline their beauty routine with these multi-purpose lip and cheek pencils in three flattering shades.
Pair the top-rated fiber mascara with any of the 14 different gel eyeliners for a customized gift that matches their vibe.
Save yourself the trouble of figuring out what perfume they might like with a sampler set like this. It has eight mini sprays so they can find their new favorite.
Just add water to these cloths and watch them remove even waterproof mascara with ease – it might as well be magic.
These silk scrunchies will look a lot chicer on their wrists than their usual black hair tie. The cute ball ornament houses four scrunchies that’ll go with any outfit.
Tide them over until they can get to their hairstylist with a trio of reparative hair-care products. This set even comes in a zippered canvas pouch they can use for traveling too.
If they’re traveling during the holidays, this mini cleanser and mask duo is a great TSA-friendly set. It includes a cream-to-oil cleanser made with floral ingredients and packed with antioxidants, and the mask is formulated with Spanish clay to decongest pores and tighten skin.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I've been sleeping on these $20 AmazonBasics sheets that have more than 20,000 online reviews — here's how they feel, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are a lot of different ways to spend $20. You can buy dinner out or a kitchen tool to help you make a meal at home. You can go see a movie. Or, you can sleep comfortably at night.
AmazonBasics, Amazon’s private label for affordable everyday essentials, makes sheets for just $20 (the price of a queen size set). The sheet set is one of the best-selling and top-rated on the site, with more than 20,000 reviews, 68% of which are five-star reviews. In terms of review cred, it’s bested only by this Mellanni set, which is $10 more expensive, and this Sweet Home Collection set, which is a few dollars cheaper.
Like other AmazonBasics products, which include phone accessories and cookware, this sheet set sticks to the basics. There’s no marketing story behind it, no fancy, innovative features to wow you. It’s a sheet set, plain and simple, and it has exactly the features you’d expect for $20.
Each set includes one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, and two pillowcases. It comes in more than 40 colors and prints, from a cute gingham to a deep burgundy, so it’s easy to find a color to suit your personal style. Some even cost less than $20. I already own a good number of lighter colored sheets, so I got a set in Plum.
The sheets are made from polyester in an OEKO-Tex Standard 100-certified factory. The fitted sheet was easy to put on my 12-inch tall mattress and stays snug around it. The sheet can fit on mattresses up to 16 inches tall.
Overall, I’ve had a good experience sleeping on these sheets. They’re soft and comfortable, though they’re not the most breathable I’ve tried. Even though I tend not to sleep hot, I can see someone overheating in them. While some reviewers took issue with how thin the sheets were, I personally thought the thickness was fine.
They’re also a bit wrinkly and that problem might be exacerbated by the fact that I got a darker color. If you care about the appearance of your sheets, I would suggest getting a lighter color or a printed style.

Comparing these sheets to sets I’ve tried that cost 10 to 15 times more, I do think there’s a noticeable difference. Sheets that I’ve tried from Casper, Third, and Primary Goods are indeed better – they’re softer, more breathable, and more durable.
However, you really can’t beat the value of these sheets. Twenty dollars is a great deal for a full sheet set, and I love that there are so many color and print options. The soft and comfortable material might not last a lifetime of uses and washes, but it’s the perfect short-term bedding solution for kids’ bedrooms, dorms and college apartments, and guest rooms. It’s one of the best budget sheet options you can buy online right now, from a brand with a lot of experience making these types of affordable essentials.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I didn’t believe the hype around the Philips air fryer until I tried it myself — here’s why I’m a convert, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon
In 2010, Philips introduced the first air fryer at a consumer electronics fair in Berlin, Germany. Since then, the appliance has taken off with dozens of brands introducing different styles.
I was hesitant to try the Philips air fryer for several reasons, including the price – it’s one of the most expensive options. Yet after using the Twin TurboStar XXL dozens of times over the past two months, I can say unequivocally that it’s the best air fryer on the market. Below, I will explore what makes it better than the competition.
The Twin TurboStar XXL lives up to the XXL in its name with a footprint of 12 inches wide, 17 inches deep, and 12 inches tall. It has an impressive temperature range of 175 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and you can adjust the temp in 25-degree increments using the dial on the front.
The dial lets you set the timer (between 1 and 60 minutes) and choose among presets, including defrost, chicken, steak, fish, and cake. And a large, LCD screen display shows you the temp and time remaining in the cooking process.
The air fryer comes with a beautiful recipe book complete with full-color photos. There are more than 30 recipes. Plus, you can access over 200 more by downloading the app.
Philips backs this air fryer with a one-year limited warranty.
The set-up process was effortless. After removing the packaging, I washed the basket and pan with soap and water. I then let the air fryer run for a few minutes to warm up. Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I had potstickers baking. They came out pretty good, but I think I’ll stick with the stovetop method. Despite being healthier, they were missing the steamed goodness. However, there were several other plates the air fryer knocked out of the park.
What impresses me most about the Philips Twin TurboStar XXL Airfryer is that it combines size with fast cooking. The stated capacity of the air fryer is 3 pounds or 4 quarts of food, and in my experience, this is conservative. I had no problem fitting 3 pounds of chicken breasts in the basket without crowding.
There are three food items I test in all air fryers: toast, french fries, and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The chicken breasts were safe to eat in 25 minutes, and they tasted juicy and delicious.
To test the french-fry capabilities, I cut up 2 pounds of yellow potatoes, tossed them with a tablespoon of olive oil and some seasoning, and put them in the air fryer. Every 10 minutes, I’d shake the basket up and see if they were done. The fries took a little less than 30 minutes, which is impressive compared to other models.
The toast was also quite fast by air fryer standards. In less than four minutes, the Twin TurboStar XXL evenly toasted a giant slice of my homemade bread.
You can also tell how well an air fryer bakes by how much heat it puts off. If the air fryer is emitting a lot of heat around the exterior, then it’s heating your house and not cooking efficiently. The Philips air fryer stays cool to the touch everywhere except the back of the appliance, where it’s incredibly hot.
I’ve tested a dozen air fryers in the last year, and the recipe books always underestimate how long the dishes will take to cook. This is not the case with the Philips recipe book. I tried recipes for fries, drumsticks, and fish, and they were all accurate and scrumptious.
I love that the parts of the air fryer that get the dirtiest – the basket, mesh bottom, “fat reducer” tray, and pan – are dishwasher safe. They cleaned up nice and tidy in my dishwasher, and I haven’t noticed any wear from using this cleaning method.
I did have a little issue with the Twin TurboStar XXL releasing a fair amount of smoke while cooking. This likely had to do with me going a little overboard with the amount of olive oil I used for a recipe. After thoroughly cleaning the unit, the smoke problem went away. So, the moral of the story is to go light on the oil. I recommend picking up an oil mister.
Unlike most air fryers, the Philips air fryer doesn’t come with accessories, such as a rack or skewers. The company sells these separately. I didn’t miss having accessories, but if you’re paying $350 for a small appliance, you’d expect it to come with plenty of extras.
From cooking family-size meals efficiently to cleaning up easily, the Philips Twin TurboStar XXL Airfryer hits all the right notes. But should you buy it? Are there more affordable and perfectly serviceable alternatives? Let’s explore your options.
Even though it’s the best I’ve tested, $250 is a lot to spend on an air fryer. However, if you have the money and want to have the best, the Twin TurboStar XXL is the model to buy, especially if you want a unit that can cook larger quantities of food quickly. Due to its size, it may not be ideal for individuals with smaller kitchens, but it could be a good alternative if you don’t have room for an oven.
You can save $50 off the price of the digital XXL by choosing the analog model. The only difference is you don’t get the convenient digital interface. Instead, you set the appliance by manually adjusting the time and temperature dials.
Philips makes a few other air fryer models, including its XL Collection and compact solutions, but we don’t feel they provide as strong of a balance of price and cooking abilities as the XXL air fryers. However, if you really want a Philips air fryer but want to limit your spending, consider the compact Philips Starfish Technology Airfryer, which only costs $150 and has a smaller footprint than the XXL.
If the Philips air fryer doesn’t appeal to you, I’ve found the following to be excellent alternatives:
Overall, there are several outstanding alternatives available, but if you have it in your budget, we strongly recommend picking up the Philips Twin TurboStar XXL Airfryer. You will appreciate how quickly it cooks large meals and how effortless it is to clean up.
Pros: 4-quart capacity, TurboStar design facilitates faster cooking, dishwasher safe, digital interface, full-color recipe book
Cons: Expensive, doesn’t come with accessories, smoking may occur if too much oil is used

From cooking family-size meals efficiently to cleaning up easily, the Philips Twin TurboStar XXL Airfryer hits all the right notes. But should you buy it? Are there more affordable and perfectly serviceable alternatives? Let’s explore your options.
Even though it’s the best I’ve tested, $250 is a lot to spend on an air fryer. However, if you have the money and want to have the best, the Twin TurboStar XXL is the model to buy, especially if you want a unit that can cook larger quantities of food quickly. Due to its size, it may not be ideal for individuals with smaller kitchens, but it could be a good alternative if you don’t have room for an oven.
You can save $50 off the price of the digital XXL by choosing the analog model. The only difference is you don’t get the convenient digital interface. Instead, you set the appliance by manually adjusting the time and temperature dials.
Philips makes a few other air fryer models, including its XL Collection and compact solutions, but we don’t feel they provide as strong of a balance of price and cooking abilities as the XXL air fryers. However, if you really want a Philips air fryer but want to limit your spending, consider the compact Philips Starfish Technology Airfryer, which only costs $150 and has a smaller footprint than the XXL.
If the Philips air fryer doesn’t appeal to you, I’ve found the following to be excellent alternatives:
Overall, there are several outstanding alternatives available, but if you have it in your budget, we strongly recommend picking up the Philips Twin TurboStar XXL Airfryer. You will appreciate how quickly it cooks large meals and how effortless it is to clean up.
Pros: 4-quart capacity, TurboStar design facilitates faster cooking, dishwasher safe, digital interface, full-color recipe book
Cons: Expensive, doesn’t come with accessories, smoking may occur if too much oil is used

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adorable tot lights up the internet as real-life Elf on the Shelf</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the festive season gets into full swing, Facebook feeds across the globe are full of naughty elves causing mischief.
And this week the Advertiser discovered the cutest Elf on the Shelf EVER as little one-year-old Parker McShane causes all sorts of mischief at his home in Coatbridge.
Parker’s mum Shannen felt her little boy was too young to appreciate getting an elf on the shelf, so gave him the role of the elf in their house.
She said: “I loved doing Elf on the Shelf so much when I was a nursery teacher and knew Parker was too little to understand it.
“So I decided to make him the elf and just have fun doing naughty things every morning!”
Mischievous little Parker has been a busy elf. So far he has managed to cover his dad David’s face with lipstick, mess up the kitchen with chocolate and cereal, put balls down the toilet and unwrap toilet paper all over the floor!
And Shannen is sure there is lots more to come in December, as Parker loves being an Elf so much he is refusing to take his outfit off.
She added: “He loves it and is getting away with being naughty and likes us telling him how he cute he is as an elf.”
Shannen’s Facebook friends have been loving finding out what little Parker the Elf has been up to each day.
One said: “Aww that’s amazing!”
Another added: “I love that idea! He’s just adorable too! Cutest elf I have ever seen!”
While another wrote: “This is amazing. He looks so pleased, wee soul.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dean Unglert Just Said Marriage Is “Never Going to Happen” With Caelynn Miller-Keyes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welp, it looks like Caelynn Miller-Keyes and Dean Unglert won’t be swapping van life for married life anytime soon, if Dean has anything to do with it. In a new interview, he didn’t hold his feelings back for anyone—not even for our poor Caelynn, who has talked about being open to marriage before.
When Us Weekly caught up with Dean at an event and asked him if he sees marriage in his and Caelynn’s future, he pretty much said that marriage is a big fat pipe dream, LOL.

Dean Was Super Hesitant to Date Caelynn at First
“That’s never going to happen,” he said. “She does joke around about us getting married all the time, and I always say, ‘Sorry, it’s not going to happen.’ I don’t know, I’m super unconventional and she obviously is a little more conventional. We joke around about it. Just try to keep expectations to a minimum, you know? Like I said on the show, underpromise, overdeliver.” Say it with me: Yikes! 😬
Oh, but that’s not all—Dean’s also got ~feelings~ about having kids too, and they seem a lil different from Caelynn’s. “The older I get, I feel like the less and less I want kids. I remember when I was a teenager, I was always so dead-set on having kids, but the world’s in flux. I don’t know if it’s necessarily the most responsible thing to do to bring a child into this world,” he added, before admitting Caelynn feels differently. “That being said, she wants kids, so I don’t know. I don’t know if I don’t want kids just because she wants kids, and I don’t want to get married just because she wants to get married.”
This is honestly very awkward, because not only is Caelynn open to marriage with Dean (“Maybe that’s in our future, but it would be way down our future,” she told Us last month), but she also uprooted her entire life TO MOVE INTO A VAN with him! I would be beyond pissed if my mans didn’t see me as marriage material after living in a car and taking water bottle baths in the name of love. But you know, to each their own!

    <h5 class="mb-1">VSCO Girl Holiday Gift Guide</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the VSCO girl meme gained popularity across high schools earlier this fall, brands, marketers and the media tried to figure out not only how this Generation Z subculture evolved, but also ways to make money from them.
For the uninitiated, the social media meme spotlights teenage girls who don oversize T-shirts, use environmentally friendly metal straws and carry their Hydro Flask-branded bottles in Fjallräven backpacks. They like shopping at Urban Outfitters, and tout their looks on VSCO, the photo app, as well as TikTok and Instagram. But for most images, they use Polaroid- and Fujifilm-branded instant print cameras.
So while the experts try to figure out how to tap this market, WWD is showcasing a few VSCO girl must-haves for the holiday shopping season:
Hydro Flask 21-ounce standard mouth insulated bottle with sport cap, $35.95 on hydroflask.com. Editor’s note: To make it authentic, VSCO girls cover their Hydro Flasks in stickers.
AC/DC distressed T-shirt dress, $44 at Urban Outfitters. The retailer’s Nirvana unplugged T-shirt dress is also trending as a “most popular” item on its web site this holiday shopping season.
Fjällräven‘s Classic Kånken backpack is made of “hard-wearing Vinylon fabric” and features a zipper that opens the full, main compartment, fjallraven.com, $80. For the holidays, the company is offering free shipping for orders over $100.
Birkenstock women’s Arizona soft footbed sandals, at dickssportinggoods.com, $134.99. For the winter, can be paired with Smartwool women’s traditional snowflake socks, $24.95. Dick’s Sporting Goods is offering free shipping this holiday season for orders over $25.
And especially for the holidays, velvet Scrunchies from claires.com, $2.99 each — to be worn mostly on the wrist.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Attico Unveils Eco-Friendly Holiday Capsule</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COOL AND GREEN: The Attico girl is a confident type indulging in the luxury of precious items — but she wants to be eco-friendly, too.
Founded in 2016 by Giorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio, the Italian women’s wear label is launching on Dec. 10 a holiday capsule collection exclusively available on the brand’s e-commerce platform comprising a range of items with sustainable features.
Nodding to the Eighties aesthetic that has become a brand’s signature, the lineup named “Call Me Back” includes six vintage fur coats crafted from mink, fox and martens that were reworked for a more contemporary silhouette, their linings and buttons overhauled. There are also three pairs of bejeweled stiletto pumps that were covered in pink, red and black Swarovski crystals’ leftovers.
To complement the offering, Tordini and Ambrosio teamed with eco-chic makeup line La Bouche Rouge, creating a matte cherry pink-hued lipstick contained in a plastic-free case made of vegan leather.
Marking the launch of the capsule collection, The Attico is releasing images nodding to vintage analog shots and a video infused with a film noir undercurrent. The short movie follows model Jazzmine Berger’s journey as she strolls in the red-carpeted corridor of a hotel, while she selects The Velvet Underground’s “Venus in Furs” song from a jukebox and until she is picked up by a vintage car.
The holiday capsule marks The Attico’s second sustainable effort. Last May California-based denim brand Re/Done tapped the designers and Instagram personalities to curate a capsule collection of upcycled floral dresses and cargo pants.
Last year, The Attico received an investment from Remo Ruffini, who acquired a 49 percent stake in the company through a vehicle called Archive Srl, controlled by Ruffini Partecipazioni Holding.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christmas done cheaper with everything you need under £100- including food and booze</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christmas can so easily be a huge expense for families that can so quickly add up.
With everything taken into consideration including food, decorations, presents and food and booze- we can all be guilty of sometimes forking out when it's completely unnecessary.
With a bit of preparation, you can have a full family Christmas for less than £100 and it shouldn't be too much of an effort.
It does not mean you need to scrimp and save on cheaper, heavily discounted items- there's award-winning fizz, Waitrose veg and four bottles of booze included - and that's not counting the brandy butter.
Financial app Wagestream made a list of everything a family of four needs to enjoy a traditional Christmas, then went on a hunt to find out where to get the best value for it.
Wagestream chief executive Peter Briffett said: “Christmas can be hugely stressful for many households, as there is massive pressure to deliver the perfect day for all the family.
“Children are bombarded with adverts showing expensive must-have toys, and families end up over-spending on Christmas in an attempt to keep up with the Joneses, which can result in expensive interest payments for credit card debt and loans in January.
“We thought it would be nice to do some research to show that you don’t have to spend a fortune to have a great Christmas — and you don’t need to scrimp on the simple pleasures either."
The pick of items include a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings - from sprouts and carrots to Chipolatas and parsnips.
In fact, the most expensive bit of the whole day is the turkey, which costs £9.99 from Lidl, followed by the cake (£6 from Tesco).
Presents are also included for mum, dad and two children - and they've even budgeted for after-dinner entertainment with board games and the obligatory box of Quality Street to nibble on while you play.
Here's the full list of what's included and where to buy it from at our top supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Waitrose, Lidl and high street favourites Boots, Wilko, The Works and Hobbycraft.
If you miss out on the vouchers in the paper or want a discount online there is another deal you can use to get £15 off your next shop.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Art Basel Miami Beach 2019: Thom Browne Makes His Artist Debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While many fashion designers were in town for Art Basel Miami Beach to celebrate their brand’s collaboration with an artist, Thom Browne was both the designer and the artist. Browne made his fine art debut during the fair, exhibiting his first art sculpture, “Palm Tree I,” in the Moore Building Atrium in the Design District just around the corner from his boutique. The full-scale palm tree was tailored in preppy pastel fabrics, situated in a square plot of black sand underneath a black mirror within the otherwise industrial building. (Gagosian and Jeffrey Deitch’s group exhibition “The Extreme Present” was concurrently shown in an adjacent space.)
“I strongly feel like it does deserve to live in a world of its own, and in the art world,” said Browne of the sculpture. “That’s how I want people to see it, because I love what I do in fashion, I love the shows, I love that business. But I do things that I think can fit within the art world as well, so it’s nice to separate it and have the fashion take a back seat for once.”
In addition to his sculpture, Browne has been painting for many years, although he has never shown his work publicly. Here, the designer discusses his approach to fine art and how it relates to his fashion design practice.
WWD: How did you come to make “Palm Tree I”?Thom Browne: It’s almost symbolic of the last 15 years, of how I actually have been doing installations and I’ve been painting in my office as well. I got to the point that it was important that I actually had these installations, that were in my specific fashion shows, and reinterpret them in a way that they could fit in the art world. And getting this opportunity to use this space here in Miami, I had the idea of this story of the American dream and being represented by the palm tree tailored in all of these American preppy fabrics.
WWD: Did you connect with Craig Robbins to bring [“Palm Tree I”] here?T.B.: I’ve known Craig just because of the store, and he offered us the space [in the Moore Building]. I was familiar with [the group exhibition] space, because I’ve been to the group shows before. But I’d never seen this space, and it just screams for something really tall. I have had this idea of the tree, but you need the space in order to be able to show it. But I did know that I wanted to contain it in a way that made people actually want to look up into the mirror, because I think there’s something really nice about that.
WWD: Are you exploring different ideas through sculpture and painting than you are through fashion?T.B.: I think they relate really closely, because I’ve been painting in my sketches for my collections for the last 10 years, and I approach them purely as from a painting point of view. It’s not like I’m thinking about how it will relate to fashion, but they indirectly relate very strongly.
WWD: In terms of your painting practice, what’s your process like? How often are you painting?T.B.: It all depends on how much time I have. I think everything in general needs to happen through how much time I have. But also to the approach being from a very noncommercial point of view, this whole thing for me is really special because I don’t want anybody to see any type of commerciality behind it. It’s a pure design, artistically approached piece of art. And the same thing with my paintings, too. Almost selfishly I was initially just doing them for myself. And then I just really loved doing it. So it’s a lot of work in my office, just because of the joy that I get out of doing it.
WWD: You free yourself from expectation.T.B.: I have to adhere to the schedule and be responsible to the [Thom Browne] business, because that’s so important to me as well. This is an outlet that’s totally devoid of any type of commercial expectations, which is so refreshing. And also I think it enhances my fashion work in a way, because sometimes when people just see fashion it becomes very one-dimensional, and I think this adds a really good dimension to just everything I do. And I think that is important for people to see.
WWD: What subjects have you been painting? Are they similar to the Thom Browne world?T.B.: It’s very connected because it’s me doing it. They relate to conceptual sketches I do from my collections, so there is a connection there. They’re very conceptual sketches, so you don’t really see how workable they are within the fashion world, because they do then ultimately get translated into fashion sketches that are workable. There is connection but it’s not direct. But they are very minimal. I love Cubism so there is a little bit of reference and I think inspiration from that world, but a very nonliteral reference.
WWD: Are you looking to do an exhibition of your paintings down the road?T.B.: The paintings are very special for me because I do them start to finish. When you do an installation like this, you do actually have people who fabricate it, and so the concept is there, and the idea and the story comes from me, but I need people that can fabricate it. So the one thing that makes painting really special is that it is 100 percent me.
WWD: Do you plan to exhibit at any point?T.B.: Who knows? I feel like this is just a start with the idea of exploring this world. And so we’ll see.
WWD: What have you been seeing during Art Basel?T.B.: I just did a talk at the Rubell Musuem, and just meeting Mera, it’s overwhelming in how inspiring they both are [Mera and Don Rubell] in regards to their approach to collecting art and their appreciation to just creation. And they say this themselves, you don’t need to have money to start collecting; just use your instincts, and it really just comes from the appreciation.
WWD: Are you looking for any art for your new house?T.B.: Yeah, we just bought a house [in Manhattan]. That we did. We have about a year and a half to finish the house, so we have some pieces.
WWD: Does “Palm Tree I” have a home after Miami?T.B.: I don’t know where it’s going, but it is very site specific, so it is something that I hope somebody will embrace, and I’d love to see it housed by somebody that appreciates it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shoppers blast M&S for 'mugging' them over Percy Pig Advent calendars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marks & Spencer shoppers have been complaining about what's inside the store's new Percy Pig Advent calendar.
Taking to Twitter, dozens of parents have slammed the calendar, as it doesn't contain a Percy Pig sweet behind each door (despite quite clearly stating on the front that it's got chocolate inside).
Even more annoying is the fact that the chocolates themselves aren't actually shaped like Percy - or anything to do with him, for that matter.
Needless to say, people aren't happy, reports the MEN .
"First day of winter and my children are disappointed that the Percy Pig advent calendar from @marksandspencer doesn’t contain pig shaped chocolate. Nothing 'Percy' about it at all," moaned one parent on social media.
"Disappointed ... Had a Percy pig advent calendar bought for me. Was thrilled. Didn't read the outside totally gutted to find chocolate behind the doors.... Am I the only one who was expecting a proper Percy sweet?" wrote another.
"Heard on the radio earlier about the marks and Spencer’s Percy Pig advent calendar..... Apparently the treat is a chocolate pig.... Why is it not an ACTUAL Percy Pig #Disapponting ," slammed somebody else.
"FURIOUS!! I bought this Percy Pig advent calendar for a dear friend who doesn't like chocolate!! DOESN'T LIKE CHOCOLATE! Why would you put chocolate in a Percy Pig product! She's very embarrassed by not eating it and I'm furious," said a FURIOUS shopper.
"But at the same time, why make a ‘Percy Pig’ advent calendar then not actually put Percy Pig’s in it? Whyyyyy?!!" exclaimed another disgruntled shopper.
Percy does, however, have some support, as one person tweeted: "It's the people who have bought [the calendar] and properly kicked off about it, when it clearly says they're chocolate on the front that made me laugh," said one amused shopper.
"It clearly states on the advent calendar '24 festive milk chocolate shapes and a bag of percy pigs for Christmas day'."
"Why are you furious at Marks & Spencer for something you've not read that is as clear as day on the product itself?" questioned somebody else.
No one can agree. It's like Brexit all over again.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ooh la la! Hollywood Actress Gwyneth Paltrow Advertises Vibrator in Goop Christmas Ad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In 2008, she launched a weekly lifestyle newsletter and years later this endeavour turned into a company called Goop, which sells products, clothing, accessories and what not for a pretty penny. Paltrow's company has been repeatedly criticized for selling medicinal products with questionable value and was even taken to court for false advertising.
Gwyneth Paltrow has raised eyebrows after her company Goop released a Christmas commercial, where the Hollywood actress advertises a vibrator. The video begins with a narrator saying: “The holidays are here and because they never turn out the way you imagined, you must cherish the joy of getting ready". The video shows Paltrow preparing for the holiday, packing presents, decorating a Christmas tree, and drinking a martini.
At some point in the video the actress is seen putting gifts under the tree and in Chirstmas stockings, while the narrator says: “Do something for others". Then in a shocking plot twist that would make Game of Thrones’ writers envious, Paltrow puts an orange object in a stocking only to pull it out and then leaves a room with a playful look on her face, while the narrator says: “Don't forget about number one - yes, that is a vibrator". The narrator then wishes everyone happy holidays and Paltrow is seen exiting the apartment, going for a “night out”.
Social media users were pleasantly shocked with the ad, although some found it distasteful. One user wrote: “The older these actresses and singers become, the nastier they get. It is sad. Class is not her thing, I guess".
Another user wrote: “People are starving and homeless but that doesn't bother Gyneth - because she just keeps getting richer. Have another martini on us.”
Paltrow and her company Goop have long been criticized for selling ordinary products for unreasonably high prices or selling products with questionable medicinal value. For example, you can find a bottle of water with inserted crystals that: “wards off negative energies, anchors the root chakra, amplifying good intentions, cultivating serenity, and guarding against bad vibes". This wonder will set you back $80.
In 2017, a consumer advocacy group filed a complaint against Goop accusing it of selling medicinal products with “deceptive” health claims. The group was concerned in particular with Goop’s vaginal “Jade Egg”, which cost $66. The company claimed the product could help women balance hormone levels, make menstrual cycles more regular and “increase their sexual energy". Paltrow had to pay $145,000 in civil penalties for false advertisement.
But despite criticism and legal battles the company is thriving and has recently opened a new store in San Fransisco.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mum accidentally swallows two front teeth while eating mince pie</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mum said 'all she wants for Christmas is her two front teeth' - after accidentally swallowing her dentures while eating a mince pie.
Angela McGill, 52, was tucking into the festive snack when she swallowed what she thought was a bit of pastry.
Gulping hard, she realised that she'd actually swallowed her partial dentures - two teeth attached to a plastic plate - and started panicking.
The caterer went to hospital and an x-ray revealed the plate was stuck half way down her throat.
Medics advised any procedure to pull the plate back up her throat would do more good than harm.
So Angela had to wait 72 hours for her dentures to pass through her digestive system - before she flushed them down the loo.
Mum-of-three Angela, from Glasgow, is "finding the funny side to this right cock-up" - but has sworn off mince pies forever.
She laughed: "I just couldn’t believe I'd swallowed my plate - how silly is that?!
"And I was really enjoying the mince pie too, I just got distracted when someone I work with said my name and I gulped.
"It was rough, and really hard - I thought it was a tough piece of pastry!
"Then it went down, and got lodged at the back of my throat, and I thought - 'oh my god, I've swallowed my plate, I've literally lost my teeth!'."
Angela had her inch-square partial dentures fitted last month to replace 40-year-old caps she had fitted as a girl after an accident.
"I was swimming when I was about 11 when this boy jumped in the pool, knocked me, and then I clattered my teeth against the edge of the pool," she said.
"Forty years on, the crowns needed replacing obviously, so they fitted me with two front teeth on this plastic plate instead."
Unused to her new teeth - which are on her bottom left-side - Angela accidentally swallowed them while eating a mince pie from supermarket Aldi on December 3.
Angela, a kitchen assistant in healthcare, went to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where medics advised to let the plate pass through her digestive system.
"When I got to hospital, it got funnier, because they'd said it would do damage to my throat if they tried to pull the plate back up," she said.
"So they told me to wait three days for the plate to pass through my system.
"I think I made their day to be honest, maybe even their year! It was ever so funny!"
Angela then added: "Obviously I wasn't going to be using that plate again - like I say, all I want for Christmas is my two front teeth!"
She is waiting to get a new set fitted - and hopes she'll get them in time for Christmas.

    <h5 class="mb-1">My 10-Year-Old Picks Starbucks For Her Dividend Duchess Portfolio</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Say Hello To My Daughter
Lucy is 10 years old and in 5th grade. She's keen on skiing, mountain biking, parkour, dancing, art, knitting, cooking, and most recently... investing in dividend growth stocks. I must admit, I'm jealous of her 40+ year time horizon. Last month, we started a specific custodian account for her to manage, which is kept separate from the college savings account that I tend to. She promptly named it the Dividend Duchess Portfolio and made her first purchase - Coca-Cola (KO).
This is the second installment of the Dividend Duchess series. To get up to speed, and learn more about our goals, I recommend reading the first articleif you haven't already. I try not to bombard her with too many concepts at once, but Lucy has been grasping everything so far, and asking thoughtful questions in return. As a dad, it sure is exciting to see her interest and understanding of compounding and passive income blossom.
Portfolio Funding Update
For fun, I decided to fund Lucy's portfolio exclusively with my earnings as a Seeking Alpha Contributor. That way, she gets a small amount of money to invest each month, and I can simultaneously report on my slowly growing (hopefully) SA contributor earnings. This might be of interest to any of you that already contribute to SA, or are considering it. I'm still new to this, but find the interaction with you guys (and gals) quite educational and inspiring. With that said, here are my contributor stats as of 12/5/19:
Last month, Lucy paid $104.46 for 2 shares of Coca-Cola. Some quick math reveals that she has $238.85 burning a hole in her pocket this month. So, how is she going to invest it?
The Stock Selection Process
After a chat about the risks of "putting all your eggs in one basket", Lucy is versed in the principle of diversification. The egg talk morphed into a goal of growing her portfolio into a dozen stocks over the next year. With that in mind, we decided to use this month's loot to purchase shares in a new company, rather than adding to KO. Hmm... what to buy?
We needed a "by the numbers" selection process. Lucy grasps the concept of businesses building a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time and why that's an important consideration when choosing potential companies to invest in. So I familiarized her with the CCC list. We then decided to use Dividend Champions (increasing dividends for 25+ years) and Dividend Contenders (increasing dividends for 10-24 years) as the first criteria for our watch list.
This gave us a daunting scroll of almost 400 companies. Way too many to navigate without dying of boredom. So, out came the highlighters and a new game. Lucy, Molly (6 year-old sister), and I sat at the dining table while mom made soup. Pink for Champions, yellow for Contenders. One question - "Do you recognize this company - yes or no?" Sure, I helped with some. Bring me your toothpaste - Procter & Gamble (PG). Grab my tape measure from my tool box - Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), etc. Next thing you know, we're rummaging through Kellogg (K) cereal in pantry, talking like the Aflac (AFL) duck and looking up the thousand uses of WD-40 (WDFC). Molly mistook Graco (GGG) for Draco Malfoy (from the Harry Potter books) and we all had a laugh. Lucy remembered Stryker (SYK) because grandpa just had his knee and hip replaced and he "wishes it paid a higher dividend". Learning + having fun = Winning!
After the recognition game, we were down to 48 companies. Next, we made a spreadsheet and plugged in one more filter. After highlighting the companies sporting a current yield higher than their 5-year average, we were quickly down to 23 solid dividend growers to choose from. Here's the list:
From there, it was time for Lucy to pick. With a 40+ year investing horizon, I figure pretty much any company in green is free game. It didn't take long before she made her choice for this month.
Definitely Starbucks, Dad
No surprise - she chose Starbucks (SBUX) right away. Instantaneous excitement and brand recognition. But I wasn't going to let her off the hook just because she's allowed a green tea frappuccino once in a while. Before logging into Schwab and making the purchase, answer me this: "Lucy, why do you think Starbucks will make a good addition to your portfolio?" First came the obligatory answers:
Classic spewing out the answers she knows the teacher wants to hear. But eventually, her "real" thoughts came out, and it's refreshing to hear it in her words:
The Magic Green Button
Now to the best part! Log in to Schwab with $238.85 to make the purchase. With a pencil and paper, she figured she could buy two shares and save the remaining cash for next month. Navigate through the trade screens, and click the magic green button:
With the purchase of 2 shares of SBUX for $169.03, the Dividend Duchess added $3.28 of passive income. This brings her estimated forward annual dividend income up to $6.48 and she has $69.82 left in cash to roll over into her next purchase. Here's a snapshot the portfolio as of 12/5/19:
Conclusion
I'm having a blast working with Lucy on her Dividend Duchess Portfolio. She's already mulling over next month's potential candidates. The underlying message is: Start 'em young. It's never too early to teach and implement a disciplined savings and investment strategy with your kids. Especially if it's woven into some games, messing around on the internet, and explaining that they're now making $6.48 a year without even lifting a finger!
I hope you'll stick around for this journey by clicking the orange "Follow" button up above.
Have any tips for teaching kids about saving/investing? What else would you like me to include in these updates? What's on your watchlist? Do tell!
As always, best of luck on your quest for financial emancipation!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome back to Byte Me, our feminist newsletter that makes everyone mad <3
Sorry, we’re late this month. Since we last spoke, Anouk went to Thailand, Cara trained with Chelsea FC, and Georgina started her new role as *editor + content creative.* WHO SAYS WOMEN CAN’T HAVE IT ALL???
Each month, our gloriously gifted designer, Saïna, illustrates a weird comment or tweet we receive from one of TNW’s misogynistic, or just funny, readers. Here’s the latest:
Now, TJ wasn’t lying… here’s Saïna’s artistic interpretation: 
BY THE WAY! Are you on Twitter? Cos we are. Follow @byte_me for clear skin!
Because we’re all magical and unique snowflakes who don’t always agree on feminist issues — and subsequently feel like we’re “bad” women — we’re going to discuss something we found online in each newsletter.
For this month’s that’s what she said, we’re discussing the benefits and drawbacks of trigger warnings, and when they should be used. We’ve linked to our full discussion here, and included the TL;DR below…
Georgina: Maybe good to start with a quick definition. Trigger warnings are like warnings or labels you put on movies, music, lectures, books, etc, to let people know that there is a topic covered that’s distressing. The biggest, or most talked about, example is sexual assault.
Cara: I haven’t seen trigger warnings hiding sexual assault online since that violates guidelines on social media. It’s more like animal abuse to raise awareness, that I’ve seen. Can you send an example of an IRL trigger warning?
Georgina: The biggest example in my experience was in university. When there was a lecture that discussed sexual assault, professors often give trigger warnings at the start. This turned into a huge discussion because some people felt like it dampened intellectual discussion by allowing people to excuse themselves from class. Some also argued that “you can’t have a trigger warning for life,” because life is upsetting and you will have to deal with confronting material.
Anouk: Isn’t talking about it beneficial though?
Cara: I’d argue yes, but depends on the situation. If it’s something that was fresh, or their still dealing with, it can be traumatizing. I think it’s about finding the balance with talking about horrible situations like assault and not treating it like a taboo.

This week we’re asked Dr. Jen Gunter, the OB/GYN, pain physician, NYT contributor, and social media activist — she’s also known as “Twitter‘s resident gynecologist” and the “Joan of Arc of Vaginas.” Rad. Read our full AMA with her here, where she discusses vaginal health and why you shouldn’t tan your anus.
The best?“The best professional advice I ever received was about my writing, that I should “write like I speak.” When I first started writing I used a “professional” tone and A) it wasn’t me and B) it was boring. Someone pointed out I explain things so well in the office or to friends and why don’t I try writing more like I speak. I hope that also helps people see that I am authentically being me.”
The worst?“The worst was to act like the guys. Starting medicine in the 1980s we were very much encouraged to be like the men, and the implication was everything about me was wrong. How I dressed (goth-ish), laughed etc. But again I think it gets back to authenticity. People want that, I certainly do. Having had two veery sick children I know that knowing their doctors are real people and not automatons is a source of comfort. I feel my concerns will be treated differently.”
Next up in our new and improved Dicktionary (sorry):
This month’s ‘word of the month’ goes to the bros out there. Just like us femspirators who need and deserve our own vocabulary, so do they.
So here it is: oxy-bro-on. It’s like an oxymoron, but for men with big egos and tiny peens. For those of you who didn’t pay attention in English class, let us refresh your memory. An oxymoron is a combination of words that contradict each other, such as a ‘silent scream,’ or a ‘small crowd.’
Now, picture the bro-y-ist bro you can think of (we’re gonna go with Dan Bilzerian), channel his highly problematic boyish charm, and try to come up with some oxymorons of your own.
We’ll help get you started:
Great! We love sexist wordplay! Here’s how an oxy-bro-on is used in a sentence:
“Chad had heard about ‘stay-at-home dads,’ but figured they’d only exist in Portland and Sweden.”
“‘This is Linda, she’s an entrepreneur from Boston’ said Bob. ‘So… like a prostitute?’ Nate answered with a puzzled look on his face.”
“Good evening doctor,” Tom greeted the male nurse standing at his mother’s bed.”
What do you think of Byte Me? Love it? Tell us. Hate it? Tell us — as female journalists we love hate mail.
Don’t forget…

    <h5 class="mb-1">Traditional Christmas desserts with a twist</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This pretty bowl of gin-spiked delight is your Christmas dessert sorted. The best bit: you can do this in stages, bits and bobs, here and there, as you get ready for Christmas. All you need to do on the day is whip a bit of cream and sprinkle all the pretty flowers, herbs and bits of delight on top.
I've kept it a little lighter – lemon curd does some of the heavy lifting rather than the usual custard. This keeps that amazing gin flavour alive through the layers. I've also ditched the traditional sponge for the crunch of golden pastry – it adds a textural reprieve between the layers. The addition of mini pavs at the top ticks two of our must-have desserts off the Christmas list. A trifle pav. Perfect.
INGREDIENTS
G&T jelly
6 titanium strength gelatin leaves
300g castor sugar
300ml water
250ml gin (I used Winston Quinn Slim Crop, but any floral, botanical gin works well)
400ml tonic water (I used Fevertree)
Pavlovas
4 egg whites
pinch of salt
1 cup castor sugar
1 tsp lemon juice or white wine vinegar
1 tsp cornflour
Lemon curd
zest and juice of 4 lemons
⅔ cup butter (about 160g)
1½ cups castor sugar
2 decent sprigs of lemon thyme
4 eggs plus 4 egg yolks
60ml gin
Crumble layer
1 sheet sweet shortcrust pastry (I used Careme)
¼ cup white chocolate chips (I used Callebaut)
½ cup roasted macadamias, roughly chopped
Whipped gin cream
400ml cream
¼ cup icing sugar
60ml gin
To garnish
125g fresh honeycomb (or a small drizzle of floral honey)
lemon verbena leaves
lemon thyme
about 20g freeze-dried raspberries
1 small punnet of edible flowers
METHOD
For the gin and tonic jelly bloom the gelatin in a bowl of icy cold water and set aside.
Add the sugar and 300ml of water to a large saucepan. Bring to the boil and stir regularly to dissolve the sugar. Add the gin and stir to combine. Add the bloomed gelatin sheets and whisk vigorously. Once fully incorporated add the tonic water and whisk again. Pour into a 25cm-diameter trifle bowl and place in the fridge to set overnight.
For mini pavlovas preheat oven to 150C and line several oven trays with baking paper.
Whisk egg whites and a pinch of salt in an electric mixer to soft peaks (4 to 5 minutes), then, with motor running, gradually add sugar and whisk until firm and glossy (2 to 3 minutes). Whisk in the lemon juice or vinegar, then fold in cornflour. Using 2 dessert spoons, shape into rough quenelles and place onto trays. Place trays in preheated oven, reduce the temperature to 120C, and bake until meringues are crisp but not coloured (1-1¼ hours). Turn off heat and cool completely in oven with the door closed (3 to 4 hours). Meringues will keep in an airtight container for one day.
To make the lemon curd add the lemon juice and zest, butter and castor sugar to a saucepan. Place over low-medium heat and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until incorporated. Add the sprigs of lemon thyme and set aside for 10 minutes.
Remove the lemon thyme then add the eggs and yolks and return pan to the heat. Whisk continually until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Add the gin and cook for another minute, then allow to cool slightly (about 15 minutes) before gently pouring the lemon curd across the gin and tonic jelly layer. Return the trifle bowl to the fridge for at least two hours to cool completely.
For the crumble preheat oven to 180C and line a baking tray with baking paper.
Place the sweet shortcrust pastry sheet on the lined tray and bake until golden and brown, about 10 minutes. Remove and allow to cool before breaking into 20-cent-coin-sized pieces into a bowl. Toss together with the white chocolate chips and roasted macadamias. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the curd layer.
To assemble: On the day of serving, whip the cream to medium-firm peaks. Sift the icing sugar over the cream and whisk to incorporate. Just before serving, stir through the gin. Dollop the cream on top of the crumble layer. Gently arrange the mini pavlovas over the gin cream layer until they reach the top of your trifle dish (you should have about two layers of meringue; just place them as best you can; there is no need to be precise). Scatter over the garnish toppings and finish with broken pieces of fresh honeycomb at the centre.
Serves 8-10
This roulade is loosely based on a Helen Goh recipe – the roulade never fails or cracks and breaks. Baking should always reward, and this is no exception. I happened to have some leftover gold edible glitter and crystalised verbena leaves from a kids' birthday cake which look pretty, but are by no means a necessity.
INGREDIENTS
Spiced sponge
4 large eggs, separated
2 heaped tsp mixed spice
130g castor sugar
2 tbsp water
70g almond meal (freshly ground is best)
80g self-raising flour
20g icing sugar
Spiced nougat and Christmas pud cream
250g cream cheese, softened and cut into cubes
150g white chocolate, melted
1 tsp vanilla bean extract
85g soft nougat, chopped into bite-sized pieces
100g Christmas pudding, roughly chopped
Topping
½ cup glace cherries, halved
2 tsp edible gold glitter (optional)
25g freeze-dried sour cherries
a few crystallised verbena leaves (optional)
METHOD
1. Preheat oven to 170C and line a swiss roll tin (about 22cm x 30cm) with baking paper.
2. Place the egg yolks and mixed spice in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Start to beat on low speed.
3. Meanwhile, add the sugar and water to a saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Stir regularly until the sugar has dissolved but not taken on any colour. Remove and allow to cool slightly (about 45 seconds), then pour down the side of the bowl of the egg yolks. Be careful that this isn't burning, or it will collapse the egg yolks. Increase speed to medium and whisk for about 4 minutes or until thick and creamy.
4. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer then gently fold through the almond meal and self-raising flour.
5. In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, then gently fold the almond mixture through the egg white mixture, one third at a time.
6. Scrape the batter into the tray and bake for 15 minutes or until the cake springs back to the touch in the centre. Remove and set aside.
7. Sift half the icing sugar over the cake and cover with a clean tea towel. Place a wire rack on top then flip it so the wire rack is underneath. Lift the tray off, carefully peel away the baking paper and lightly dust the top of the cake with the remaining icing sugar.
8. With one of the short ends of the sponge facing towards you, roll up the still warm cake with the tea towel inside. Allow the rolled cake to rest for 20 minutes or so, then gently unroll and set aside to cool completely. The cake will be curved at the ends, but this helps prevent the sponge from breaking – it trains it for its second roll.
9. Add the filling ingredients, except the nougat and pudding pieces, to a bowl and whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined.
10. When ready to assemble, remove the tea towel from the cake. Use a small spatula to spread most of the white chocolate and cream cheese mixture across the surface of the sponge, leaving a 2cm border without any cream at the short end of the cake furthest away from you. Scatter the chunks of nougat and Christmas pudding over the cream.
11. Roll the cake up as you did before. Transfer the cake to a long platter.
12. If you have a few tablespoons or so of the white chocolate cream cheese remaining spread this along the top of the roulade, to help the toppings to stick. Scatter over the freeze-dried sour cherries, glace cherries and any other Christmassy toppings you'd like to use, then cut into 2.5-3cm-thick slices and serve.

    <h5 class="mb-1">5 perfect gifts for bakers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">1. King Arthur Flour Fresh Sourdough Starter($9)
"Sourdough baking can be challenging, to say the least," writes Sarah Jampel at Bon Appetit. This starter-in-a-jar takes the stress out of creating a fermented dough, and because it descends from a strain that's over 100 years old, "you know it's going to be bubbly, active, and reliable." Buy it at King Arthur Flour.
2. Silpat Half-Size Baking Mat($21)
Don't want to fuss with parchment paper? Place this French-made mat on a baking sheet to create a nonstick surface. Made of ­dishwasher-safe silicone embedded with heat-conducting fiberglass, the Silpat "performs beautifully." Buy it at Amazon.
3. Whetstone Woodenware French Rolling Pin ($27)
Tapered, French-style rolling pins offer far better control than pins with handles, and they're also easier to clean. This 23-inch maple pin is "ideal for rolling rounds of crust for pie," writes Hannah Kirshner at The Wirecutter, and it's "sturdy enough to last a lifetime." Buy it at Whetstone Woodenware.
4. Jenaluca Cookie Scoop($18)
A sturdy portion scoop is the secret to making trays of uniform-size cookies quickly. And once you have one, you might also reach for it when making cupcakes, muffins, or meatballs. Available in three sizes or as a three-piece set. Buy it at Amazon.
5. CDN TM8 Multi-Task Timer($16)
This trusty little kitchen timer "will become your handy sidekick," writes Zoë Sessums at Bon Appetit. The TM8 can clip to an apron, stick to a fridge, and track multiple tasks at once. After ringing, it begins counting up, so you know how much time has elapsed. Buy it at Amazon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The surprising things stolen from luxury hotel rooms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(CNN) - When checking out of a five-star hotel, thrifty travelers have been known to slip a few shower caps, mini-shampoos or even slippers into their suitcases.
But more brazen guests are managing to steal bulkier items -- including mattresses, coffee machines and even a stuffed animal, hotel and spa reviewer Wellness Heaven found in a survey of 1,157 four- and five-star hoteliers.
An astonishing 49 hotels reported that mattresses had been stolen from their premises since January 2018, CEO of Wellness Heaven Tassilo Keilmann told CNN, adding that it was likely hotels could have suffered multiple thefts.
Hoteliers told Keilmann that mattresses are often stolen at night.
"They told me that it usually happens in the night -- when the reception is not open, when there is nobody there. Some of them have security camera footage showing them transporting it to the elevator," he told CNN.
While towels, bathrobes and coat hangers were the items most frequently pilfered from luxury hotels, guests also tried to steal bulkier or more expensive items, including tablet computers and TV sets, the survey of mostly European and Asian proprietors found.
"This was surprising to me, because it is quite easy for the hotel group to determine which person stole it, because the maid will look after checkout, and it's easy to say this guest stole the TV or the mattress," Keilmann added.
Whereas many four-star hotels have taken to tagging their items to trigger alarms when smuggled off the premises, five-star hotels are less likely to confront thieves or to report the theft to police, Keilmann told CNN.
"In a lot of cases, they don't report it to the police, because they don't want to be connected to crime," Keilmann said.
Wellness Heaven surveyed 634 four-star and 523 five-star hotels, and observed a "striking difference" between the guests -- researchers said TV sets, tablet computers and mattresses were stolen more frequently in five-star establishments, whereas four-star guests were more interested in batteries and remote controls.
One of the most surprising thefts, Keilmann told CNN, was a stuffed boar's head taken from a hotel in France.
And one guest in an English hotel pocketed the numbers from the door of his room -- something the hotel only discovered when the next occupant couldn't find it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hotel pilferers set their sights on MATTRESSES as five-star establishments find luxury 'rain-effect' showers, TVs and artwork are also vanishing along with their bathrobes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Guests are now stealing mattresses from five star hotels, along with televisions, shower heads, artwork and coffee makers.
The luxury beds are worth so much and are filled with so much technology that they have become a target for thieves, a survey has revealed.
Researchers said that the difficulty of walking past a reception desk with a super-kingsize means that most mattresses go missing at night, in hotels that have lifts directly serving underground car parks.
Mattresses with memory foam or temperature controls means many hotels are selling rooms on the comfort of their beds, some of which cost thousands of pounds.
It is unclear whether the mattresses were being replaced with old ones to make discovery of the crime less immediately likely, The Times reports.
The study found that five-star hotels were eight times more likely to have their mattresses stolen than four-star hotels. 
They are not the only unlikely items to go missing. Luxury bathroom fittings, such as 'rain effect' shower heads, have been unscrewed.
Televisions, artwork and coffee-makers have all disappeared too.
One Austrian Spa hotel had a pine bench stolen from a guest's private sauna. In Italy a hotel reported that a grand piano had been taken from its lobby. 
The owner said: 'I noticed that something was missing, and soon after I learnt that three unknown men in overalls had taken away the grand piano. It never reappeared.'
The survey was carried out with 1,157 hoteliers by Wellness Heaven, the Spa hotel review website.
It found that British guests were generally less ambitious in their crimes and were most likely to steal towels, bathrobes and toiletries.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In this episode of Motley Fool Money, host Chris Hill and analysts Jason Moser, Emily Flippen, and Ron Gross discuss some of the biggest recent business news. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin step down from their roles at the company, but aren't leaving completely. Constellation Brands' (NYSE:STZ) acquisition of Ballast Point looks a lot less appealing after the sell-off. Ulta Beauty puts up a mixed bag of an earnings report, but the market seems to like it. Plus, updates from United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), and Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE); and, the analysts share some stocks on their radar.
Stay tuned for a chat with Jackie Breyer of The Toy Book and The Toy Insider about toys -- the hottest trends this year, how toy makers are getting a little more high-tech, how the competitive landscape has shifted, and more.

This video was recorded on Dec. 6, 2019.
Chris Hill: We begin with the ever-spinning revolving door to the corner office. A week of CEO departures was highlighted by one of the biggest companies in the public markets. Alphabet co-founder Larry Page is stepping down as CEO and will be replaced by Sundar Pichai, who has been running the show at Alphabet's most important division -- that's Google. Sergey Brin, Alphabet's other co-founder, is stepping down as president. Both Page and Brin are going to stay on the board. Jason, Pichai is the right person for the job. This is as smooth a transition as you could want if you're a shareholder. I'm still surprised by how quiet all of this has been, given the size of the company.
Jason Moser: Yeah. I think it's probably been quiet essentially because the bottom line is, I think, for Alphabet shareholders, this is a good move. I mean, this is good news. Succession plans, as we know, are always a very big question mark, particularly as a business gets closer and closer to its leadership aging out. They're not necessarily aging out in this case, but I think they are off to do bigger and better things, perhaps, with their lives, as opposed to just looking after the day-to-day at the company. So I think we saw the market react positively to the news. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we now have more certainty in regard to Alphabet's future and leadership.
Pichai, as you mentioned, is the right man for the job. And let's face it, I mean, he's been with the company now for around five years. Shareholders have benefited greatly from his leadership. Shares have doubled over that course of time. He's grown revenue at an annualized rate of 20% over that time.
There are all sorts of opinions out there as to why the time is now that this is happening is, are there political motives, are Page and Brin trying to avoid maybe being thrown into the spotlight with all of these regulation concerns. That, I guess, we could deliberate over the course of 2020. But for now, as a shareholder in Alphabet, I'm OK with this news.
Emily Flippen: Yeah, Page and Brin have done a lot for Alphabet in terms of side projects, if you will, investments into new initiatives. What's really interesting about Pichai is -- some people have speculated this -- that he's going to focus more on the core businesses. We've said it on the show before that YouTube is probably one of those things that Alphabet has really not monetized to its full potential. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see them more focused on its core search business, plus, hopefully, maybe some change regarding the way that YouTube is run within Alphabet.
Ron Gross: Yeah, I think this is an acknowledgement that Google primarily is the business. It's a somewhat conservative take on the business, de-emphasizing some of the potential home runs in favor of the incredible cash cow that Google is. I've got an idea -- how about we call the company Google?
Hill: Well, it really does seem like a move back toward that because of how important Google is to the business of Alphabet. Also, we're talking about Pichai. Ruth Porat, the CFO, is still there. The business is in very good hands. But Page and Brin were as big of champions of the Other Bets the business was making as anybody, and it wouldn't surprise me if in 12 to 24 months, some of those Other Bets just get completely defunded.
Moser: I think it's fair to say this is probably an implicit admission that the Alphabet structure hasn't taken off, perhaps, like they thought it would have. I mean, yes, this is a Google story. The name of the company, for all intents and purposes, really should still be just Google. But with that said, this certainly is a company that's not thinking over the course of quarters. I mean, they're thinking over the course of decades, really. And you have to admire that, given where they stand today with Pichai, with Porat. I mean, I really do feel good about the leadership they have in place to keep this business going forward.
And it's worth nothing, too, Page and Brin will still be a big part of this company. They're just not going to be doing it from the positions they held.
Hill: United Airlines also getting a new CEO. Oscar Munoz is stepping back. Will remain as executive chairman. Scott Kirby taking the corner office at United. Ron, you think this is a good move?
Gross: Yeah. Kudos to Munoz for having a great tenure there. The stock up about 56% since he took the reins, which is significantly outperforming the New York Stock Exchange Airline Index. But, a lot of the initiatives were actually led by Kirby. A lot of the aggressive growth strategy that has turned United around were led by Mr. Kirby. So, if you're a shareholder, I think you're pretty excited about this succession. It makes perfect sense to have him just elevated to the top.
Flippen: Yeah, and it's not surprising at all. Munoz took Kirby on in the midst of United's transformation, when they were struggling, both losing ground to American Airlines, which Kirby came from, and also struggling with things like that horrible incident where they were dragging doctors off of planes. The turnaround was much needed, but the bar was low when Kirby came on for United.
Gross: Yeah. Let's not forget -- three months after he took the reins, he had a heart attack, a heart transplant, and he went on to lead this company to a pretty nice turnaround. Now, I think, it continues under Kirby.
Hill: Anyone looking to be the CEO of Expedia can apply to chairman Barry Diller. Mark Okerstrom, the former CEO, and chief financial officer Alan Pickerill, resigned this week. Jason, add them to the list of people who went up against Barry Diller and lost.
Moser: You don't cross Barry Diller. He knows people and stuff and has a lot of resources and has his hand in a lot of cookie jars. Yeah, I mean, it's nice to see, at least, CEOs being removed for underperformance, right?
Hill: Yeah. It's refreshing to hear there's nothing untoward with another employee. This is just, "You're not getting the job done and you have to go."
Moser: And that's fair. I mean, if you look at Expedia's financials, revenue growth has slowed. You have to wonder how they're going to continue to compete with booking.com, which is obviously the behemoth in the space. We saw a lot of those same types of red flags market-wise with TripAdvisor's most recent announcement. And you can't forget, either, the role that Google plays here in this space with their search engine. I mean, search really is just an important part of everything that goes on in virtually everything that we do, and travel is no exception. So, yeah, whoever steps into that leadership position with Expedia definitely has their work cut out for him.
Gross: Cautionary tale for United, because back in the day, the succession plan at Expedia looked perfectly in line when the other CEO went to run Uber. Not everything works out. You can't run on your laurels, you have to perform.
Moser: You know what I noticed? Chelsea Clinton is an independent director on Expedia's board. Given her age, still young, obviously very intelligent, you have to wonder if someone like that doesn't have professional aspirations, at some point, to become a CEO at some time or another. I just noticed that, and the ideas started running around in my head.
Hill: Zoom Video is a growth company and Zoom's third quarter report showed that growth is slowing. Shares of Zoom down 10% on Friday, Emily.
Flippen: That's misleading, "Growth is slowing." Do you know how much their revenue growth was last quarter?
Moser: A lot?
Flippen: 85%. [laughs] "Growth is slowing." Yes, it's slowed down from 96% last quarter and 103% the quarter before that. So, yes --
Hill: I didn't say it was bad! I just said it was slowing!
Flippen: [laughs] Growth is definitely slowing, and the market, man, they have hammered them for it. But, look, they're still growing at 85%. That's top line growth. And they're a profitable company, which is really saying something, given the market that we're in today. So, I understand the concern about slowing growth, but you also have to realize that no company is going to grow at triple digits forever. And we just need to make sure that valuations are in line with new expectations for growth. That's what we're seeing happen today for Zoom. Stock's down largely because it was trading at something like 38X sales beforehand. Really, clearly, a very frothy valuation, but a strong business, and a business that admittedly is slowing down a little bit, but it's still growing significantly. Ultimately, it's just an issue of valuation, not really an issue in the business here.
Gross: I want to note that you use the word valuation three times, and I'm impressed. And that is what it's all about, because if they need to grow at 95% to support the stock price, and they're growing at 85% or less, the stock deserves to come down. And that'll happen every time.
Hill: You're so happy to have another value investor in the room.
Flippen: [laughs] Hey, hey, don't go that far.
Hill: Real quick before we move off of Zoom, the stock is basically trading where it was when it IPO-ed in April of 2018. Safe to assume the valuation is at least a little bit more reasonable now?
Flippen: Yeah, I think it's definitely a little bit more reasonable right now. I think the bigger concern is that people don't know how big the market for Zoom could be. So, its ability to continue to grow significantly is largely going to be dependent upon their ability to penetrate a largely unknown and untapped market. You have a hard time when you look to value -- Ron -- a company like Zoom.
Moser: I will say, I was down at Wofford College a couple weeks ago speaking, and it came to light that they're big fans of Zoom there as well. It got me thinking that there is a tremendous opportunity in the education space, higher education all the way down, I think, for companies like Zoom. It was nice to hear that they had such a positive review there.
Hill: Ulta Beauty put up mixed results in the third quarter, but someone must have liked what they saw because shares of Ulta Beauty were up 13% on Friday, Ron.
Gross: Beat expectations after a really tough earnings report last quarter, and the stock just got slammed. This time around, pretty good. Net sales up almost 8%. Comp sales up 3%. Driven by both transaction growth of 2% and almost a 1% growth in average ticket. Nice to see both of those things growing. Company has really been capitalizing on this demand for celebrity-led beauty brands, whether it's folks like Kylie Jenner, Jennifer Lopez, YouTuber James Charles, who I've never heard of. I don't know if you guys have.
The top line looks pretty good here. Gross margins widened, I like that as well. But operating expenses were up due to investments in growth initiatives. Labor costs higher. We're seeing that across the board at lots of retailers. So, as a result, net income was actually down slightly at 1%. Earnings per share faring a little better, up 3%, but that was solely because of share buybacks.
Flippen: I'm not nearly as entrenched in the beauty space as a 25-year-old girl should be, but I do know enough to know that the beauty market, especially as it applies to makeup, is being so largely driven by Google's YouTube, again. Actually, you mentioned a little bit the celebrity agreements they have there. Those are so vital. It's, honestly, a little bit of a harder business for Ulta now because there's so much direct-to-consumer availability for these celebrities to get their products out to their watchers, and that's driving a lot of purchases. It's taking away business from Ulta unless they have those partnerships in place, which hurts their margin. So it's a hard business to make work. I'm impressed that they're not slowing down faster.
Hill: Shares of DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) hitting a new high on Friday after strong third quarter results. Revenue came in higher than expected for the electronic signature company. Jason, if you like traditional profits, DocuSign probably is not for you yet. But, DocuSign is getting it done.
Moser: Listen, as a shareholder in DocuSign, I'm feeling pretty good about today. Listen, when I think of management teams that are executing beyond their aspirations, DocuSign really is one that comes to mind. There was a blip in the middle of the year, if you recall, where the stock got hit on buildings concerns. But that really actually was a great example of a knee jerk reaction that provided investors an opportunity, because, if you remember, shares dropped all the way down to $48 and change in that time. But really, like you said, the business is accelerating. Revenue growth is impressive. They hit the upper end of the target for billings this quarter with growth of 36% there. Raised guidance for billings and revenue for the full year.
I think you want to look at a business like this and figure out what they're doing to leverage their core competency. With DocuSign, that's e-signature, right? So, they've done a very good job in taking that core competency in e-signature and building out this thing called the agreement cloud, which is a suite of more than a dozen offerings and hundreds of integrations that help companies, enterprises, individuals, manage the life of their contracts. And contracts, as we know, are just a big part of business. Big opportunity to play in the mortgage sandbox as well. They're getting into the housing business --
Gross: [laughs] "Mortgage sandbox" sounds like no fun.
Moser: It's not the sexiest business in the world, but there's a ton of money flowing through it, and it's nice to see DocuSign trying to get their share there as well. So, I think, all things considered, strong quarter. Like you said, not traditionally -- is that what you said? -- profitable. We're living in a non-GAAP world now anyways, Chris, so you just have to go ahead and embrace it.
Flippen: It's so easy to point at DocuSign and say that it's a business that's going to lose out to something like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). It's kind of the Slack vs Microsoft Teams argument, where if a company's already using Adobe, then why would they go out of their way, pay extra, pay the premium that exists for DocuSign, when they have something already accessible. I think it goes, like Jason mentioned, to two testaments. A testament of the really strong underlying products. They're a solely focused business on e-signatures. That means they can make that experience as great as possible. But, expanding it to the entire contract lifecycle management business. And they see that as their biggest opportunity moving forward. There's definitely value in addition to being the verbiage of e-signatures, right? DocuSign it.
Moser: Yeah, and customer growth is still there. Total customers up 24% now to 562,000. Even more importantly, enterprise and commercial customers grew 30% to 69,000. So, something they're doing is working.
Hill: Third quarter same-store sales for discount retailer Five Below came in a little higher than Wall Street was expecting. Ron, are they raising prices at Five Below? The name of the business is Five Below and I'm seeing all these stories that they're starting to raise prices.
Gross: A little bit. Introduced their Ten Below gift shop section, highlighting on more expensive toys and games. We can make fun of that all day. We'll see how that goes. This is a little bit like Ulta, where if you focus on the top line, things look pretty good. Net sales up 21%. Comp sales up 2.9%. But when you start to look at the cost structure a little bit, it gets a little bit more of a mixed bag. Operating income was actually down as a result of tariff and some other merchandise costs. Earnings actually down 24%. The company continues to grow, continues to open a significant number of stores -- 61 new stores recently, almost 900 now in total. They did manage, interestingly, to raise the low end of their full-year guidance despite the fact that it was a relatively weak report on the bottom line. But even so, 40X for a business that is having a little bit of struggles right here, especially on the cost side, I'd be careful.
Hill: How big a footprint are they looking to get? I mean, 900 locations. We see a lot of headlines about bricks and mortar stores closing. Put them, along with Planet Fitness, on the list of businesses that are expanding their footprint.
Gross: Significantly more expansion, to lots more areas of the country. They feel that there's plenty of room to grow.
Hill: In December 2015, Constellation Brands made headlines when it shelled out $1 billion for Ballast Point Brewing, a craft beer company based in San Diego. This week, Constellation Brands sold Ballast Point to Kings & Convicts, a tiny brewery in Chicago. Emily, the reports from the beer industry trade media indicate that Kings & Convicts paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million to get this. What is going on at Constellation Brands?
Flippen: It's a great question. Those same reports say that they actually weren't shopping around Ballast Point either, which means that some point, likely, Kings & Convicts just approached them and said, "Hey, we could give you $80 million for this." And then Constellation Brands took it. They were like, "Yeah, good deal!" Something they paid, just three or four years prior, $1 billion for. It's clearly a bad acquisition their part. They said it was just an issue of how they saw the beer industry developing, and just simply not in the direction of Ballast Point. But it doesn't build a lot of confidence in investors, especially because up to the point of this sale, they'd only impaired about $200 million worth of that acquisition. It begs the question of, you clearly under-impaired this asset. What does that mean for all the other acquisitions that you've made?
Hill: And, at the time, Constellation Brands was seen as, maybe they overpaid, but they'll be able to expand it in their network, and they weren't able to do that.
Moser: Well, they weren't able to do that. There were two concerns with the acquisition as I saw it. No. 1: they paid 12X sales for it, which is just absurd. I mean, if you look at Boston Beer today, trading around 4X sales, and that business has been on fire thanks to the seltzer and cider parts. But then you just have to wonder, ultimately, they miss read how that brand would proliferate, nationally speaking, and it just never worked out.
Hill: A late Thanksgiving means this is the shortest holiday shopping season since 2013. Here with some insights and more on the toy industry is Jackie Breyer, editorial director of The Toy Book and The Toy Insider. She joins me now from New York City. Jackie, thanks so much for being here!
Jackie Breyer: Thanks for having me!
Hill: Before we get to the toy businesses themselves, let's talk about the toys. What are the hot toys for 2019?
Breyer: That is a great question. I would love to say it's baby Yoda toys. I don't know if you've heard all the excitement around the new baby Yoda. Have you been on the internet lately?
Hill: Oh, I'm a Disney+ subscriber. I was looking for some baby Yoda stuff and, like everyone looking for baby Yoda stuff, instantly disappointed that nothing's available.
Breyer: It is not there. You can pre-order, but it's not here yet. So, while it is probably the thing people are most excited about in that area ... There are some toys that are hot, and this is the time of year when it starts to become apparent what are the hot, in-demand toys that parents should be buying quickly or else they're not going to be able to get their hands on them. Now that Black Friday and Cyber Monday have passed, everyone's out shopping and taking it seriously. Like you said, it's coming up really fast this year.
One thing is Ryan's World. I don't know how familiar you are with Ryan Toys Review, the YouTube channel.
Hill: I am not.
Breyer: Ryan is a YouTube star, multi-millionaire child who unboxes toys. He has over 30 billion views on his videos. He has his own toy line. So now, kids can unbox toys just like Ryan. Ryan's their best friend, and they go on adventures together. So, anything Ryan -- there's a pirate treasure chest, there's a secret safe, there's surprise eggs -- it's all hot. If your child is into Ryan, you're going to want to pick those up if you come across them.
Hill: What about technology and toys? Because it seems like for years, toys have essentially been losing out to versions of technology, whether that is a consumption device like an iPad or some sort of tablet, or just video games themselves. Are the toy makers doing a better job now of integrating technology into actual toys?
Breyer: You know, it's interesting. Yes, on the one hand, absolutely, we're seeing a much better job. It's not just tech for the sake of technology, like I would have said five or 10 years ago. There are companies doing a great job with technology. Hatchimals, which was one of the super-hot toys a few years back, they have Hatchimals WOW, it's very intuitive. Kids have a lot of fun with it. Cubby, the FurReal Friend, the Curious Bear from Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS). That is really cute, great use of technology. And, stuff like the Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak. I don't know if you're familiar with that, from Wow! Stuff. Kids can put on the invisibility cloak just like Harry Potter, and when they're facing their tablet, it appears that they're disappearing behind their cloak, completely invisible. So, there's a lot of cool technology that we're seeing out there.
But the flip side of that is, parents, especially millennial parents, seem to be reverting back to the classic toys and traditional play patterns. We're seeing, actually, fewer tech toys, and more inclination toward the simpler, classic play patterns that we had when were kids.
Hill: That's interesting. One of the notes I had down was about the level to which toys are cyclical. I'm not a millennial, but I've absolutely bought things in the past for my kids that were updated versions of toys or games that I enjoyed when I was a kid. It's interesting to hear that millennials are doing that as well now that they're becoming parents.
Breyer: Yeah, it's completely true. The retro nostalgia is real with millennials. I'm a Gen Xer myself, and I have little kids, and I love to buy them 80s stuff. [laughs] We have an Asteroids machine at home. I love introducing my favorite things to them. I know that parents do love that. If it's one of your favorite memories, and you see something that is either the same or an updated version of that, it's just a really great way to actually share an experience with your kids, rather than giving them something and kind of walking away.
Hill: When it comes to the toy retailers, the major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target, what does the competitive landscape look like these days?
Breyer: It's very interesting. After Toys R Us went under last year -- you know they relaunched a couple of stores this year. We were actually there yesterday and we had a lot of fun. But, it's not what it was. It's not hundreds and hundreds of stores. So, Target, in my opinion, is winning the toy war of trying to snatch up the extra toy dollars left on the table after Toys R Us went out of business. They've done a number of different things to make themselves the location for parents and gift-givers to go shopping for toys. First of all, they did partner with Toys R Us. for example, the Toys R Us store I was in yesterday, in Paramus, New Jersey, they have kiosks all over the store, but they're highly intuitive. Let's say I'm in their Lego shop. I can go in their Lego shop. They have stuff there in the store, but not nearly the hundreds and hundreds of Lego SKUs that are out there. So, you can go, find what you want on the kiosk. Super easy. Scan the QR code with your phone, and you're instantly adding the item to your cart, in the Target app. So, Target has that. And really, anyone who goes to toysrus.com and shops for toys, when they go to purchase, they'll be rerouted to Target. So, maybe a little bit of consumer confusion. Why am I on toysrus.com and I'm actually being shipped over to Target? But, people trust Target, and it's just extra traffic. So, that's one way. 
They also launched Disney boutiques within some of their stores. With the Disney partnership, they're driving traffic and consumer experience. There's a lot of interactivity. Lights and sounds and fun things for parents and families to actually do in those little boutiques. I think they're in 25 stores, but they're expecting to expand it next year. And there's a lot of exclusive products there that previously you would have only been able to find at a Disney Store.
And then they're also using Shipt, which you probably know they acquired not that long ago. So, now, they have same-day delivery. So, when you're shopping -- I've done this myself -- you need X, Y, Z stuff. You don't want to run out. You order it. Your stuff comes in a couple of hours, but you could add toys, you can do your holiday shopping, and they'll deliver it all to you, same day.
So, I think all these -- the conveniences, the experience, and really the expansion in general of their toy offerings, and the refreshment of their toy section -- that leads me to feel like they are winning the toy war.
But, other retailers are doing a lot to gain some traction in the toy category. Walmart launched the Walmart Toy Lab, which allows kids to go on to Walmart's website, and they are testing toys virtually. It's fun, it's cute, it's interactive, and it helps kids decide what they want to ask for for holiday gifts.
And then, Amazon. Who doesn't love to shop on Amazon? It's just the most convenient thing. They have launched their second annual print copy of their toy catalog. It's kind of the reverse. They're taking their tech experience that makes it so convenient and so easy and bringing it into homes. So, you're getting this 90-page, beautiful catalog. It's actually a really nice, thick stock. And you hand it to your kids and say, "Circle what you want." It's bringing back that retro nostalgic Sears toy catalog feeling for parents. And then parents, if they don't want to actually search on Amazon, they can just scan the pictures in the catalog, and it populates into their Amazon app. It's really simple.
Hill: I'm just shaking my head at the idea that of all the things Amazon has done, they've resurrected the Sears Wish Book catalog.
Breyers: [laughs] It's actually really nice, too! It's beautiful. I can't imagine what they spent on that. It's 90 pages of thick stock. It really makes you want to flip through it. They did a really good job with that.
Hill: So, at The Motley Fool, we look at businesses, we look at the stock performance of those businesses. And when you look, particularly over the last few years, at Hasbro and Mattel, from an overall business standpoint, from a stock standpoint, Hasbro has dramatically outperformed Mattel. What is the view from someone in your position, who looks at them as producers of actual toys? How do you think about Hasbro and Mattel?
Breyer: Well, they're definitely the two dominating forces. I've been in the toy industry now for over 17 years, so I've seen a lot of back and forth. Mattel is No. 1, Hasbro's No. 1. They're both huge forces to be reckoned with. They both have really great core brands. For Mattel, Hot Wheels and Barbie are strong. They continue to be strong. And while it's somewhat cyclical, they're always among the top 10 selling toys for the holidays. Every year, no fail. And that's really important. I think that having lost the Disney license a few years ago to Hasbro was a big deal. Hasbro has Frozen, they have Star Wars, it's huge, and they also have Marvel. With all of those really high-profile licenses, they've got a big advantage that way. And, of course, they have their strong proprietary brands as well, like Nerf. But everyone is looking for the baby Yoda -- well, it's not actually baby Yoda. But, Hasbro is going to have collector products, but not until probably third or fourth quarter next year. So, we'll look for that to be exciting for everyone. Mattel, actually, even though they lost that license, they are going to have the baby Yoda plush with a vinyl head, apparently. We call it slicensing, when they take a license and slice it like, "You can have this version of the plush, and you can have this version of the plush." So, it's interesting to see that Mattel will also have a license for that property.
Hill: As we talked about at the top, it's a really crunched timeframe for people who are doing their holiday shopping. I'm curious before we wrap up if you have any tips for people who are doing some, I don't want to say last-minute toy shopping, but we're getting pretty close to the last minute.
Breyer: Yep. First of all, grab that must-have toy when you see it. If you're shopping for a preschool kid and you see a Ryan toy, just buy it. But, really, any toy. If you see your kid's favorite character or something like that, don't wait, because it will be gone. Christmas is three weeks away at this point. If you're shopping for a kid you don't know as well, stick with the classics, traditional play, board games, Legos, Play-Doh, all that kind of stuff is solid winners. Just keep an eye on the online shopping. I know everyone thinks, "So convenient, I'll just buy it on Amazon!" Things can get back ordered. Even if something is Prime, make sure of the actual delivery date. Sometimes you just assume that means two days or one day, and it could mean two weeks or it could mean January. So, just be careful. Pay attention to that thing. Know your prices. There's price gouging out there. If you are shopping online in particular, know what a product should cost so you don't overpay.

Back in July, an independent group of McDonald's franchisees sent a letter to company management pleading for a better chicken sandwich to compete against the likes of Chick-fil-A. This week, that wish was granted. McDonald's is testing a Southern-style crispy chicken sandwich in Houston, Texas, and Knoxville, Tennessee. Our producer Mac Greer will be heading back to Texas over the winter break, so we'll get his review in January. But the dozens of listeners are already sending in their reviews.
We got an email from Judy Griffin in Knoxville, Tennessee who writes, "The bun was buttery, similar to how Chick-fil-A's buns taste. The chicken also tasted very similar. But it was not as thick as Chick-fil-A's, nor as crispy. If Chick-fil-A is a 7 out of 10, I would say this is a 6 out of 10. I would get it again, especially on Sundays. Thanks and keep up the good work."
Judy, thank you for doing some boots-on-the-ground research. And, did you catch the key phrase there, Ron? Especially on Sundays.
Gross: Yeah, that little poke.
Hill: That is what you're hoping for if you're McDonald's. What do you think, Emily?
Flippen: I think we've all been really excited, waiting for this chicken sandwich for a while, but perhaps no one was more excited than Bob Derrington, the managing director and senior research analyst at the Telsey Advisory Group, who had some choice words about the McDonald's sandwich. His phrases included that they were "lightly battered, juicier, and more flavorful as an upgrade from MCD's heavily battered, less juicy buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich." And he said that it included a "full-muscled chicken breast."
Moser: That just sounds grody.
Gross: Am I the only one that remembers from 2005 to 2015, they actually had a Chick-fil-A knockoff sandwich already at McDonald's, with the pickles and everything? I hope this is better.
Moser: I have zippy concerns about the sandwich because I'll never have it. I just don't go to McDonald's. I'm just excited about the validation, because I feel like we were talking about this on MarketFoolery several months ago. "Of course leadership is going to do this, they're getting feedback from boots-on-the-ground franchisees, it's just a matter of time!" And then it's just crickets, nothing. The validation is what makes me feel good about all this.

Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, he's off this week. But Rick Engdahl is here. So, Rick will hit you with a question. Ron Gross. you're up first. What are you looking at this week?
Gross: I'm looking at Hasbro, HAS. One of the world's largest makers of toys and games. This is a little hairy here. Weaker than expected quarterly earnings and concerns over tariffs really caused a dip in the share price recently, I think giving investors a nice opportunity to buy the stock. Company has a nice combination between toys and brands and entertainment. Successfully expanding their digital offerings. They've raised their dividend every year for the past 16 years. Current yield is 2.7%. I think they're set up well for the holiday season.
Hill: Rick, question about Hasbro?
Rick Engdahl: They do Star Wars and Marvel and all that. What's the movie property they don't have that they need?
Gross: They've got Frozen. They've got Iron Man and those guys. What do we have?
Moser: They could probably dip their toes into the Fast and Furious world. Those movies don't ever seem to stop.
Gross: They never end, right? I like that, I'm going with that.
Hill: Emily Flippen, what are you looking at this week?
Flippen: Hasbro, more like Has-been! You know what I'm looking at? A way more exciting company!
Gross: I'm just sitting here, minding my own business!
Flippen:CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is my radar stock, CRWD. CrowdStrike is a cloud native security platform. It really caters to organizations that are looking to protect themselves from cyber security threats. Really impressive financial results. Average annual revenue grew 97% last quarter. 120% dollar-based net retention rate, so, it's a strong business.
Hill: Rick, question about CrowdStrike?
Engdahl: Emily, weren't you one of the people who recommended FireEye? Why should I trust you on CrowdStrike?
Flippen: I was not one of the people that recommended FireEye, thank goodness there! [laughs] But, it's a good question. CrowdStrike is a cloud native platform. It's actually one of the big competitors that's been stealing customers from companies like FireEye. I think the bigger concern is Palo Alto Networks, which is the stronger legacy player.
Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at this week?
Moser: It was mentioned earlier, Adobe, ticker ADBE. Earnings come out this coming Thursday, December 12th. In simplest description, Adobe is a digital media company. But it's clearly very wide-reaching in what it does there. Big subscription model that I'm a fan of. 88% of revenue is tied to subscriptions that range anywhere from one to 36 months. And much like DocuSign, that we talked about earlier, they've done a very good job in building out an impressive suite offerings based on their core competency in digital media. Really excited to see where Adobe Arrow goes as we move into this AR and VR driven world. And you know, I did just bring Adobe into our augmented reality service here, so I'm excited about that.
Hill: Rick, question about Adobe?
Engdahl: Jason, as someone who works in the multimedia world, does Adobe even have any competition anymore?
Moser: I think that's a very good point. Adobe is a very big company at this point, around a $140 billion market cap. There are competitors out there trying to dabble in the space. But it's amazing, the resources that Adobe has to fight back. Any competition that springs up, they can snap them right up. I really think Adobe owns this market.
Hill: Adobe, CrowdStrike, Hasbro. Three very different businesses. Rick, you have a stock you want to add your watch list?
Engdahl: Well, I already own Adobe, so I'll throw Hasbro in the list.
Gross: Finally, a win! Had to get Steve out of here to finally get a win.
Engdahl: I've got kids, Emily, I'm old.
Hill: Alright. Ron Gross, Emily Flippen, Jason Moser, thanks for being here!
Gross: Thanks, Chris!
Hill: That's going to do it for this week's edition of Motley Fool Money. Keep the emails coming. radio@fool.com is our email address. The show is mixed by Rick Engdahl. Our producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening, we'll see you next week!

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to create a slap-up family Christmas dinner for less than £50</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christmas dinner is probably one of the most loved meals of the year.
But when you add up the cost of the meat, all the trimmings and a sweet treat, it can also be an extremely expensive meal.
So financial app Wagestream went on a hunt for all the Christmas dinner essentials and where you can buy them cheapest.  
They found a way to cook the meal for four people for less than £50, MirrorOnline reports.
Wagestream chief executive Peter Briffett said: "Christmas can be hugely stressful for many households, as there is massive pressure to deliver the perfect day for all the family.
"We thought it would be nice to do some research to show that you don’t have to spend a fortune to have a great Christmas — and you don’t need to scrimp on the simple pleasures either."
Christmas dinner comes with all the trimmings - from sprouts and carrots to Chipolatas and parsnips.
In fact, the most expensive bit of the whole meal is the turkey, which costs £9.99 from Lidl.
Here's the full list of what's included and where to buy it:

Kim Smith
Model Katelyn Runck took to Instagram over the weekend to show off her incredible figure in a barely-there bikini.
The tiny number featured a classic triangle top that could hardly contain her voluptuous chest, revealing plenty of skin and cleavage. The bottoms were just as skimpy, consisting over little more than fabric and strings.
Katelyn’s update consisted of three photos that showed her sitting outside on a deck decorated with cushions and curtains. Green foliage could be seen in the background as the model posed for the camera.
One photo showed the stunner from the side as she looked at something off in the distance. With one hand on the small of her back, Kalteyn gave her followers a good look at her chest, including quite a bit of side boob. The shot also showed off her flat midsection and her toned thighs.
Another picture captured the beauty from the front as she posed with a CBD product in her hand. She leaned on one hand while holding the product with her other hand on one knee. The pose showed off her tight abs and hourglass figure as she titled her head and gave the camera a smile.
The remaining snap showed Katelyn’s entire body as she looked ahead with a serious look on her face. She posed with one hand on one knee as her bronze skin popped against the white fabric. With her back straight, she gave her followers a nice look at her cleavage, slender waist and the curve of her hip. The pose also put her long, lean legs on display.
Katelyn wore her hair down with a deep side part. Her makeup included sculpted brows, eyeliner and a nude gloss on her lips. She donned a pic color on her nails.
In the caption, Katelyn longed for summer and plugged the product. She also asked her followers which photo was their favorite.
Many fans were able to pick a photo they liked, but others had a hard time choosing just one. However, all of her fans seemed to agree that she looked incredible in all of them.
“Gorgeous as always,” one fan wrote.

“Never ending beauty and elegance,” said a second admirer.
“Angel from the sky,” commented a third follower.
“I can’t believe how incredible you are,” wrote a fourth fan.
Katelyn definitely has an incredible body, and she likes to show it off in an array of outfits including sexy dresses and lingerie.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Kim Smith
Anastasiya Kvitko heated up Instagram with her latest post in which she wore a string bikini that left little to the imagination.
The beauty appeared to be on a deck in the update, which consisted of three photos that showed her wearing a tiger-striped thong bikini. The top looked like it barely fit her as it stretched across her chest. The top had strings that wrapped around her abdomen, calling attention to her thin waist. The bottoms were nothing more than small pieces of fabric held around her hips by thin strings.
One of the photos captured Anastasiya from behind at a slight side angle. The snap showed her from the mid-thigh up, giving her fans a nice look at her world-famous booty in the cheeky bottoms as well as some side boob.
Another picture showed the stunner from behind as she sat on a cushion. The round curve of her hip and her thick thighs were a focal point in the shot, as Anastasiya tuned to look at the camera.
The last photo captured the model from the front as she leaned on one elbow. With her other arm at her waist, she looked down with a serious look on her face. The pose gave her followers a good look at her voluptuous chest, as well as her flat abs and curvy hips.
Anastasiya gave her followers an extra treat with the snap as she was wearing a blond wig. Her makeup was flawless and included dark brows, thick lashes and a matte color on her lips. She donned a pink color on her nails and accessorized with bracelets on one arm.
The beauty wrote an inspirational caption in the post, while also plugging Fashion Nova.
Her followers loved seeing her in the bikini. Many also commented on how much they liked the blond hair color.
“Beauty and perfection in this picture and cute hair style looks good on you,” one follower said.
Loading...
“That hair colour looks so dope on you,” a second admirer wrote.
“You are even hotter being blonde,” commented a third fan.
“You look beautiful in that blonde hair,” a fourth follower chimed in.
Judging from her Instagram account, Anastasiya has been sporting the blond hair off and on since Halloween. She recently paired the blond look with a pair of skintight pants. Regardless of what color her hair is, the model’s fan can count on her looking fabulous in everything she wears.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For an activity that's supposed to get you back to basics, there’s a surprising amount of gear involved in camping. There's the tent, sleeping bag, air mattress, pillows, and plenty of other essentials. All this equipment gets expensive, and just thinking about lugging pounds of gear on your back into the woods might squash your desire to camp before you even hit the trail. But the Crua Modus, a 6-in-1 camping system, takes all of those essentials and crams them into one convenient pack.
Made by Crua Outdoors, the Modus already raised over $177,000 on Kickstarter in under two hours, crushing its original $20,000 goal. But you can still back this product until January 9, 2020. Pledges start at $199, and “early bird” backers will receive the Crua Modus for $329—40 percent off the regular retail value.
The Modus is broken down into parts:
When you’re ready to head home, this tent folds up into a 29.5-inch by 8.5-inch bag that weighs 8.5 pounds. So not only does this make for a light load, but it won’t take up too much space at home.
Now that you’ve got some room your pack, check out these other essentials for tackling the great outdoors. And if you still need a little extra convincing to go camping, check out these scientific benefits of going outside.
Mental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers and may receive a small percentage of any sale. But we choose all products independently and only get commission on items you buy and don't return, so we're only happy if you're happy. Thanks for helping us pay the bills!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: Tools Up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If I have time to kill on a lazy weekend and I come across a local co-op game in the style of Overcooked, chances are high I'm gonna want to take it for a whirl. That's exactly how I fell into Tools Up, a team-building – and potentially friendship-wrecking – home renovation game for one to four players.
Tools Up is nowhere near as good as Overcooked, for a few reasons, but I don't regret playing it at all.
Tools Up (Nintendo Switch [reviewed], PC, PS4, Xbox One)Developer: The Knights of UnityPublisher: All in! GamesReleased: December 3, 2019MSRP: $19.99
There's something so innately satisfying about laying down wallpaper and tiles, at least in low-stakes simplified video-game form. Grout, glue, and mortar are a mess to deal with in real life, and while the same can be said for Tools Up, that's part of the fun of arcade party games. Plus, cleanup is a cinch.
Each of the 30 levels is a time trial of sorts – a several-minutes-long race to finish as much of a home-improvement work order as you possibly can in exchange for a one- to three-star rating at the end. While the clock ticks down, you'll rush to pick up and read blueprints, figure out which room needs what done, grab supplies, and divvy up duties if you're playing cooperatively (which is what I'd recommend).
A typical home might require new walls – either a particular style of wallpaper or shade of paint – and new carpeting. In both cases, you'll likely need to rip out the old to make way for the new. You'll tear everything up, toss it in a bucket, bring said bucket to the dumpster, and get to work. Except, you usually won't have all your supplies right away (they'll be delivered at random intervals by an impatient delivery guy who won't wait around long), and you won't know precisely what each finished room should look like without manually inspecting the blueprints to see a preview. Oh, and you can't leave a mess.
Paint buckets will spill. Rolls of carpet won't sit still. You can accidentally rip a door straight off its hinges. There's no shortage of ways in which you or your pesky teammates can tear the place up. It's not enough to finish a job to the homeowner's specifications – you also have to leave it spotless. So even if you "win," you aren't getting the full three star-rating if you forget some supplies inside.
My favorite parts of Tools Up were the moments where tight quarters proved tricky; where we genuinely had to work together – either to run to the front door for an out-of-nowhere delivery, or to move heavy furniture out of each other's way – rather than kind of just separately do our own thing.
I also love how flooring works. There's a "cooldown" period after placing each segment of flooring that prevents anyone from walking over it – a slight wrinkle that requires planning and communication.
As you settle into Tools Up, you'll probably expect to see new environmental themes, but there are just a couple, including slippery floors and lava pools. You'll also probably expect the game to introduce fresh concepts over time to keep you on your toes, but aside from wall-busting demotion and bricklaying, there isn't a whole lot else to discover. The levels have a strange meandering pace overall. For instance: the final mission? Not so bad! Definitely much easier than the random level in which a tiny dog terrorizes your group, blocking the path and knocking supplies over every step of the way.
To sum it up, there are hints of greatness. But just hints.
The actual act of playing Tools Up – while very simplistic – is enjoyable in the moment, and it's particularity well-suited to families with a range of video game expertise. But it's hard not to want more unique challenges, either with physical obstacles or more creatively demanding interior designs.
Tools Up doesn't make the most of its clever co-op gaming concept, but I still had a decent enough time. I'll be there day one if a sequel ever takes this home-renovation hook and runs wild with it.
[This review is based on a retail build of the game purchased by the reviewer.]
Tools Up reviewed by Jordan Devore
Slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy it a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.How we score:  The Destructoid reviews guide

    <h5 class="mb-1">PSA: Go to Pokemon Sword and Shield's Stow-on-Side marketplace every day, as early as possible</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So there's a few things I've been picking up on since really getting into the Pokemon Sword and Shield endgame. 250-strong Pokedex? Ha! It's 360 now: I basically just need cross-game exclusives, which I'll get from my copy of Shield soon enough.
Here's another endgame tip that'll help you evolve a few more creatures.
Very early on in the game you'll head to one of your first gym battles in "Stow-on-Side," a desert mountain town just north of Route 6 (make sure you get your kicks). As soon as you enter there's a Pokemon Center, then a tiny little marketplace/bazaar on your left.
That marketplace is actually pretty important, as it restocks fairly important items daily, like a Protector: the item required to evolve Rhydon into Rhyperior (which I just picked up yesterday!). The trader's stock might change every day, but you can talk to him after you buy the daily item to see what the next item will be, so you can plan ahead.
It's a small little thing, but an important one if you want to get those last few evolutions without hunting down or grinding out rare items. Get on it early (as soon as you get to Stow-on-Side) and keep flying back each day: don't forget!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">User stomps up to the cubicle of this pilot fish tech who’s responsible for backups and snaps, “You need to restore my spreadsheet!”
“Normally,” says fish, “people start a conversation with hello, but I let that go."
Fish asks user where she stores the spreadsheet. “On my laptop.”
I’m sorry, fish tells her, but we don’t back up laptops. Anything important should be kept on a server.
“No, you don't understand,” user says. “I need that spreadsheet!”
Fish is about to lose his cool, so he tells uers to speak with his manager, sitting in the cube across the aisle.
At the manager’s cube, user humbly knocks. “Hi, Fred,” she says. “I need to get my spreadsheet back.”
Manager: Where do you keep it?
User: “It’s on my laptop.”
Manager: I’m sorry, but we don’t back up laptops. You should have kept it on a server.Confesses fish: “I did not inform the user that she should check the trash can on her laptop.
“My manager didn’t, either.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In most countries, trains are simply a convenient way to get around, to flatten quarters, or—if you’re a movie villain—to rid yourself of enemies. For the Japanese, however, they are a national point of pride, even inspiring social subsets of various types of “train nerds” (ranging from tori-tetsu, who like to take photos of trains, to oto-tetsu, who enjoy recording the sounds of trains). To call Kiha a “train-themed sake bar” may be an understatement; it’s more like a stationary train car that serves sake.
Down to the handrails, benches, and luggage racks, the upstairs at Kiha recreates the nostalgic experience of sitting on an early version of Tokyo’s subway cars—but with even more drinking. In keeping with period details, the bar serves two things: canned sake and canned food, both typical items eaten on trains in the days before bento boxes.
Over the years, the bar has acquired and decorated its walls with train-related collectors’ items such as ticket stubs, miniature models of train stations, and announcement speaker systems of yesteryear.
Thorough thematics draw the heartiest of Tokyo’s train fans out of the woodwork, niche groups known for visiting as many stations as possible and dedicating complex timetables and transit routes to memory. Test their mettle after a canned sake or five.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farm.One</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Underneath New York City’s grid of traffic jams and steaming manholes, a basement contains a jungle of tiny herbs. From Thai basil to bright-faced violets, the plants grow under the glow of LEDs, their roots suspended in nothing but water. This is Farm.One, a hydroponic urban farm growing unique and flavorful herbs, flowers, and greens right in the middle of Manhattan’s restaurant scene. The vertical farm, which is open to visitors for tours, supplies bike-delivered greens to local restaurants. 
The farm is based on hydroponics, meaning that plants grow with their roots submerged directly in water, not soil. This model of farming stresses sustainability. The lack of soil means no need for pesticide and as much as 95 percent less water use. Farm.One’s version of hydroponics is especially high-tech, with the plant-growing conditions controlled by a central computer. And because the farm is right next door to the specialty restaurants that use its produce, delivery emissions are virtually zero. 
This advanced system yields around 500 varieties of specialty herbs, flowers, and greens. Visitors can sample the fuzzy lavender petals of anise-hyssop flowers—minty with a light licorice flavor—or the surprisingly piney tang of raw cilantro berries. Even rarer plants are available for purchase online, including toothache (also known as “Szechuan”) buttons, whose citrusy, mouth-tingling finish can indeed help numb your oral woes, and the “cheese plant,” a coffee tree vine whose leaves linger on the taste buds with “an unusual finish of creamy roquefort.”
While at-home enthusiasts can purchase these ingredients directly from the Farm.One website, fancy restaurants form the bulk of the farm’s clientele: Combined, the farm’s clients have a total of 14 Michelin stars. Conventionally, these urban eateries sourced their rare ingredients from much farther afield, using plane, train, and automobile to transport uniquely flavored flowers and herbs from upstate New York and beyond. Farm.One is helping cut down on some of those emissions costs by growing rare ingredients closer to the table. For those of us who can’t afford a white-tablecloth dining experience, however, tours of the farm come with ample taste-testing.
Visitors have to sign up for tours in advance on the Farm.One website. One-hour tours include vegetable and herb tasting and, to make it a proper party, a glass of Prosecco. Cheers to green!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elizabeth Hurley, 54, is ringing in the holidays — and her newfound Instagram follower count — with a sexy new post! The British celeb took to her social media platform on Dec. 8, showing off her glowing skin and stunning blue eyes, while wearing nothing but a scarlet red bed sheet. Elizabeth, who was seated on the floor for the snap, looked positively glowing as she captioned the pic, “I wear lots of red but Chinese red, aka Valentino red, is by far and away my favourite shade. And perfect for Xmas ❤️.” She looked so beautiful draped in the crimson color, but it’s nothing shocking for fans of the multi-hyphenate celeb.
Elizabeth always looks so incredibly confident when showing off her toned figure, and did so again on Dec. 2! The Austin Powers star flaunted her toned core and built arms and legs in a swimsuit snap she posted to Instagram. In promotion of the last day of her Elizabeth Hurley Beach Black Friday sale, she treated her one million plus followers to a smiling photo of her rocking the line’s “Honey Bikini” — a pale green string bikini with gold hardware. Elizabeth looked truly radiant with the tropical background, but there was more where that pic came from!
Of course, Elizabeth’s figure looks good in practically everything, and she proved that once again on Nov. 29. The actress posted a snap of herself, donned in a glittering green dress by Retrofete in quasi-celebration of Thanksgiving Day. “Being English, we don’t really celebrate Thanksgiving, but we still like sparkly dresses and cuddling our friends and family,” she captioned the snap. Elizabeth looked picture perfect in her sequin garb, and the dress accentuated her figure perfectly with a one-shoulder strap.
Fans of Elizabeth love how her fashion has changed over the years and love to see her current style chronicled on her social media! Still, her latest post simply showed off her gorgeous, natural beauty with her recent accrual of over one million followers! As the holidays near closer, fans cannot wait to see what she will wear and post next!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kaia Gerber’s Hair Makeover: Model Chops Off Locks Into Her Shortest Bob Yet – Before & After Pics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kaia Gerber, 18, loves switching up her hair and the supermodel debuted yet another super short hairstyle when she took to Instagram on Sunday, Dec. 8. Kaia has been rocking a short bob for the past few months, but she chose to take her look to a whole new level when she chopped it off even shorter. She posted an Instagram story of her new look while she was shaking her hair in the mirror, and she captioned the video, “Can’t seem to keep my hair on my head.” Kaia’s new hair is a super short bob that ends at her jawline and frames her gorgeous face perfectly. Before chopping it shorter, Kaia’s hair was a short chin-length bob that she would wear down in waves and parted in the middle. Kaia’s new look is super sophisticated and chic and we love the way she looks.
Kaia isn’t the only one who has been switching up her hairstyle recently, in fact, tons of celebrities have been debuting hair makeovers lately. Pink, 40, just shaved her entire head when she posted her new buzzed look to Instagram on Dec. 5. Meanwhile, Nicole Scherzinger, 41, revealed a brand new short bob haircut which grazed her jawline, at the British Fashion Awards at Royal Albert Hall in London on Dec. 2. Kim Kardashian, 39, also just debuted a short black bob in LA on Dec. 2, after rocking chest-length hair to the People’s Choice Awards on November 10. Ashley Benson, 29, also debuted a gorgeous new bob when she shared photos of her haircut on Instagram on Dec. 1.
Another celeb to switch up their hair was Bella Hadid, 23, who showed off gorgeous long hair backstage at the Dior Men’s Pre-Fall 2020 Show in Miami on Tuesday, December 3. Bella rocked super long, dark brown hair which ended at her breasts and was parted in the middle in gorgeous tousled, undone waves.
There have been so many gorgeous celebrity hair makeovers this year and you can see them all when you click through the gallery above!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Is there anything that Beyonce, 38, can’t do? The singer just graced the January 2020 cover of Elle magazine, and she looks unbelievably sexy in a bunch of different outfits for the photoshoot. One of our favorite photos is the cover, which sees Bey rocking a burgundy track top bodysuit with a plunging V-neckline, as she chose to keep the top unzipped revealing braless cleavage. Both the one-piece and the harness bag are both from her IVY PARK x adidas collaboration. She accessorized her look with a pair of gold Lana Jewelry hoop earrings and dazzling Ofira rings. Throughout the entire shoot, Beyonce rocked super long tight braids which started all the way at her scalp and ended at her waist.
Aside from her bodysuit on the first cover, Bey looked even sexier on the second cover which sees her sitting down in nothing but a skintight burgundy IVY PARK x adidas dress which was zipped up all the way to her neck. On top of the mini, she threw on an oversized green plaid Gucci coat, which she chose to keep draped over her shoulders, revealing her bare toned legs. She kept her same gold Lana Jewelry hoops on for this cover.
As if Beyonce’s looks couldn’t get any better, another photo has Beyonce pictured sitting on top of a car in front of a laundromat, wearing an oversized deep red asymmetrical coat with orange stripes, 7/8 tights and super sleek 72 sneakers from IVY PARK x adidas. Underneath her coat, she rocked a cream Junya Watanabe trench dress with a long, flowy lace maxi skirt and she accessorized with an Hermès beret, Lana Jewelry earrings, a Lorraine Schwartz necklace and Ofira rings.
This was a super exciting shoot for Bey considering she launched a new adidas partnership for IVY PARK and officially owns IVY PARK completely. Throughout the entire shoot, she looks gorgeous in pieces from her collection, and we are absolutely obsessed with this spread! We can’t wait for the issue to hit newsstands on December 17.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kingsland, Soul Tree to form JV, UK set for bulk wine imports from India</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A joint venture between Kingsland Drinks and Indian wine producer Soul Tree will result in the very first shipment of bulk wine from India to the UK this month.
Soul Tree and Kingsland Drinks, one of the UK's independent drinks companies, are set to launch a duo of wines which will be available for the cheaper house wine market on Indian restaurant wine lists in Britain.
We believe there is a clear market opportunity for Indian wine, especially in the Indian restaurant sector, said Ed Baker, managing director at Kingsland Drinks.
Comprising of Soul Tree Red and Soul Tree White, the pair of wines are designed to drink alongside Indian food and join the brand's existing varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Ros and Cabernet Sauvignon. The new wines will be bottled, packed and distributed from Kingsland Drinks full-service site in Irlam, Greater Manchester.
The entire Soul Tree wine range will carry a brand-new look, designed by Kingsland's in-house design team in conjunction with Soul Tree, which it says builds on the brand's existing identity.
Adam Marshall, buying controller at Kingsland Drinks, told Retail Times': The Soul Tree range represents the very first Indian wine in our portfolio and a fresh segment for the category; India is now officially on the map as a bulk wine producer, and we're excited to lead the way by bringing Soul Tree wines in bulk directly to the UK on-trade.
Alok Mathur, co-founder and director of Soul Tree wines, added: We are really proud to put Indian wines on the bulk wine map, and the joint venture with Kingsland Drinks presents the opportunity to be part of one of the widest portfolios available to the UK market.
The collaboration builds on our existing varietal range and offers the opportunity to grow our footprint even more so in the UK.
The new Soul Tree wines are targetted at the house wine tier on restaurant wine lists in Britain and will be available through various wholesalers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebrate the Raspberry Pi’s 8th birthday at a Raspberry Jam</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On 29 February 2020, the Raspberry Pi Foundation will celebrate the eighth birthday of the Raspberry Pi computer (or its second birthday, depending on how strict you are about counting leap years).
Like any parent, we feel like time has flown by, and it’s remarkable to think how far we’ve come in such a short space of time.
Since launching the credit-card–sized $35 Raspberry Pi Model B, we have sold 30 million high-quality, low-cost computers worldwide. Raspberry Pi has become the third best-selling general-purpose computer ever, behind only the Mac and the PC.
Our latest model, Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, is still the size of a credit card and still costs $35, but it’s around 20 times faster, with more and speedier connectivity, as well as the neater board design that we introduced in 2014. Raspberry Pi computers are used everywhere from homes, schools, and factories to penguin colonies, volcanoes, and the International Space Station.
In many ways, what’s been even more remarkable than the success of the product is the amazing community that has formed around our tiny, low-cost computer. These are the makers, educators, hobbyists, and entrepreneurs from all walks of life and all corners of the globe who share our passion for inspiring the next generation of digital creators. You can often read about them on this blog and in the official community magazine, The MagPi. You can also meet them in person at a Raspberry Jam.
Raspberry Jams are community-led meetups that bring people together to share, connect, and learn from each other. The first one was held in Manchester in 2012, and so far Jams have been held in more than 70 countries — and that’s just the ones we know about.
While Jams take place throughout the year, there’s a special tradition of Jams celebrating the birthday of the Raspberry Pi computer. This year, there were over 130 Raspberry Jam events in 39 countries, attended by 8000 people. Now that’s a party!
Next year, because it’s a big birthday, we’ll be sending a special box of swag to any Jam that is taking place between Saturday 15 February and Sunday 15 March 2020.
It’s really simple to register your Birthday Jam: just fill in the Raspberry Jam submission form, including a valid event information URL linking to a webpage with more information about your event. (This is an excellent example of a Jam event listing.)
We’d prefer you to link to a public ticketing system (e.g. Eventbrite) if possible, but we know some libraries and community centres have restrictions that prevent them from doing this.
In order to ensure that your pack reaches you in time, we need you to register your Birthday Jam at least six weeks before your event.
As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask us via jam@raspberrypi.org.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pasty shop Malcolm Barnecutt opens in Plymouth city centre</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cornish pasty shop Malcolm Barnecutt has made its first move into Devon by opening a store in Plymouth city centre.
The pasty makers have taken on the former Early Learning Centre - ironically on Cornwall Street - with doors now open to the public ahead of Christmas.
Owner and son of Malcolm, James Barnecutt, said: "We're a fourth generation company and this is our 12th shop, our first one in Devon.
"It's going really well so far and we're really happy.
"We wanted to come to Devon because we fancied the challenge of trying a city.
"The towns in Cornwall are suffering a little bit because of the out of town supermarkets and the banks closing.
"I just thought it would be nice to get into a city where there is a massive footfall.
"We opened last Thursday and it's been 12 months in the planning. It took quite a while but we got there.
"We've got two or three shops that have got indoor seating but a lot of them are just takeaways.
"Because of the size of the shop we're able to do seating and we're doing really well with coffees and eat ins so that's great."
Malcolm’s grandfather Percy founded Barnecutts in 1930 in Liskeard. He also owned and ran a bakery in Bugle, before opening a shop and bakers in Trebetherick, still known today as Rock Bakery.
Malcolm Barnecutt has many shops throughout Cornwall and now Plymouth offering Cornish Pasties, Saffron Cakes, a wide range of mouth-watering confectionery, and several recipes handed down by Malcolm’s father and grandfather.
The lower floor of the premises is used as a food prep area with fridges and freezers, with the ground floor level featuring two seating areas with 17 tables, a servery, food prep area, a lounge seating area, toilets and dishwashing facilities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Family's fury over M&S Christmas tree that's getting scathing reviews</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mother has blasted Marks and Spencer after discovering her new fake Christmas tree looks like "a twig without any leaves".
Aniela Jasionowicz, 29, bought the £35 tree - which comes with a set of decorations - from the M&S website.
But she said the 6ft decoration looks nothing like the bushy tree on the website.
Aniela from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, said: “I was hugely disappointed because we put a lot of time and effort into putting the tree up.
“We took it down straight away because it looks awful.
“It looks like a twig without any leaves. I expected a quality product but that’s not what we got.
“The image on the website does not represent the product and I feel like we were sold short.”
Marks and Spencer advertises the tree as a “sparkling surprise” and comes with pre-lit lights and 59 separate decorations.
Personal assistant Aniela, who is married to Stefan 29, said the couple were especially excited to decorate their house for their daughter’s first Christmas.
Talia is six-months-old and Aniela wanted to make this Christmas extra special for her.
But with just over two weeks to go before Christmas the family are yet to find a replacement tree and have been given a refund by M&S following a complaint.
Aniela added: “The photo of it online looked great and I thought it’d look really nice.
“I thought I had got myself a great deal.
“But for me it is false advertising. I was really disappointed because it looks like a completely different tree altogether.”
Other less than impressed customers have left some equally scathing reviews about the product online.
One shopper gave the tree a one star rating, saying it is of "poor quality" and "not value for money".
Other people said: "The tree is very cheaply made and looks dead."
"We are so disappointed with this tree. It’s so sparse it looks awful. Thought we could rely on Marks for quality but seems that’s no longer true.
"The pictures online are completely different to the tree you get. A toilet brush has more branches.
"Tree is VERY sparse and really bare with the branches. Had to add extra lights, baubles, thin tinsel and beading to fill it out. Not impressed with quality at all."
M&S have given Aniela a full refund and a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. 
Marks and Spencer has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aldi is selling Prosecco for just £3.99 a bottle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christmas has just come early at Aldi - the budget supermarket has slashed the price of its Prosecco to just £3.99 a bottle.
Customers at the German budget supermarket, which has stores all over Devon and Cornwall, can pick up a bottle of Aldi's Prosecco for just £3.99 right now.
The supermarket cut the price of its festive fizz on Friday, December 6, so customers can now snap up a bottle of Costellore Prosecco Frizzante DOC  at a  bargain price, reports Birmingham Live.
It contains a 10.5% alcohol by volume (ABV) and comes in a 75cl bottle - which provides around six servings.
Whilst the Prosecco is currently sold out online, Aldi has more than 830 stores in the UK where you could potentially buy one - but we'd advise calling up your nearest store to check if it's available before making a trip.
The offer won't be around for long, though, so you'll need to be quick if you want to get your hands on a bottle in time for Christmas and New Year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Air Jordan 11 "Bred" Headlines This Week's Best Footwear Drops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">2019 is slowly but surely drawing to a close. However, footwear brands aren’t taking any time off to celebrate the holidays — they’re bringing plenty of new product to market before the calendar turns. The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is an optimal time to push out shoes of all styles, shapes and sizes, so there’s plenty of new goodness coming your way over these next five days. But before we take a look ahead, let’s recap everything that went down over the last seven days.
Without question, the biggest news of the week was the official unveiling of the Dior x Air Jordan 1. Showcased alongside Dior’s Fall 2020 collection at a Miami runway show, the shoe comes with ultra-high levels of hype to match its rumored $2,000 USD price point. That wasn’t the only piece of footwear news from Dior however as the brand also showed off a new iteration of its in-line B23, adorned with Sean Stussy’s recognizable artwork.
fragment frontman Hiroshi Fujiwara also caused quite a stir among AJ1 lovers and old-school Nike heads by taking to his Instagram to reveal an upcoming two-pack that features the first-ever Air Ship retro. Accompanied by an all-new Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG colorway, this significant style is set to release in 2020 and garnered considerable excitement. And as always, Kanye West and the adidas YEEZY line made some noise. Two silhouettes — the YEEZY 500 High “Slate” and YEEZY BOOST 700 “Carbon Blue” — were officially announced, while more releases for next year were teased as well, namely the YEEZY BOOST 700 MNVN “Phosphor” and YEEZY BOOST 350 v2 “Marsh.”
From a sustainable standpoint, Reebok announced the Floatride Forever Grow, a shoe constructed of plant-based material with tech purported to match the finest running shoes on the market today. On the political end of the spectrum, Nike backed legislation to battle counterfeit goods, aiming to block imports of fakes at the US border. And to end things on a more light-hearted note, Takashi Murakami and Post Malone provided smiles and free sneakers, respectively: the former wore a wild pair of Mr. Bailey kicks inspired by his “The Simple Things” sculpture from 2009, while the latter pulled up to Chicken Express — his onetime place of employment — to bless unsuspecting customers with free early pairs of his new Crocs collaboration.
Now that you’re all caught up, it’s time to dive into what’s coming your way over these next five days. See the best releases the week has to offer directly below, and let us know what your personal favorite pair that’s dropping is as well.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Très Bien and poster-sized publication SNEEZE Magazine have collaborated on a clothing and accessory capsule collection that aims to join Très Bien’s sportswear aesthetic with SNEEZE’s artistic eye. The capsule consists of pieces that take classic items a step further in material and design, from a leather anorak and bucket hat to a ruby shirt with bold, offset stripes. SNEEZE’s iconic outline logo graces many pieces in the collection, most unexpectedly on a pair of plaid wool trousers that come in either grey or navy.
Some of the more traditional offerings in the collection stand out based on their of-the-moment color palettes, including SNEEZE logo crewnecks in stone blue and oatmeal and a bold block rugby shirt with hints of a blue similar to Pantone’s Color of the Year 2020, Classic Blue. A navy fleece vest is also upgraded with a navy and orange oversized chest pouch pocket. Three different T-shirts, two with Très Bien’s logo and one with SNEEZE’s logo, round out the capsule.
The full SNEEZE x Très Bien capsule collection will be available over on Très Bien’s website and SNEEZE’s website beginning December 13. To celebrate the collection, a launch party will be taking place in London on December 11. RSVP information can be found in the Instagram post below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">adidas Football Throws It Back to 2002 With BOOST-Equipped Predator Mania Pack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">adidas Football has unveiled a pair of BOOST-indebted sneakers for both on and off the pitch dubbed the Predator Mania.
Kicking off the pack is the Predator Mania sneaker, a full-length BOOST-equipped off-field sneaker complete with a hardwearing Continental rubber outsole for optimum levels of traction. Aside from its technical sole unit, adidas has constructed the sneaker’s upper from premium K-leather and has incorporated curved forefoot pads, too.
It draws heavily upon the 2002 original while bringing an all-new colorway, implementing a faithfully recreated design complete with silver-toned Three Stripes and a tongue cover. Elsewhere, you’ll find a heel cup adorned with ultraBOOST branding, a classic adidas logo on the rear, and more Three Stripe branding at the heel.
The Firm Ground Cleat appears in a rarely-seen colorway of bright red and silver also made from premium K-leather, which sports the curved forefoot pads and a long fold-over tongue. This cleat combines a thin layer of BOOST in its midsole with the traditional studded outsole — that come with a hybridized twisting and traction-enhancing system as standard — as well as an innovative injection-molded Controlframe that helps stabilize fast movements.
The off-pitch sneaker will retail for $250 USD and the cleat will retail for $350 USD. To purchase either of the adidas Football Predator Manias, head over to adidas.com where they will release on December 11.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Golfing goods company Seamus Golf has teamed up with Nike for a shoe suitable for golf enthusiasts and sneakerheads alike. The result of the collaboration is the Seamus x Nike Golf Air Zoom Victory Tour, which mixes leather and wool for an updated take on classic golf style.
The shoe’s outer features brown leather with woodland camouflage waxed canvas on the upper and tongue, while the interior is lined with Pendleton® Tucson Black wool. The shoe also includes a foam sock liner and Nike’s signature Zoom Air unit for extra cushioning. To add even more grip and traction, the sneaker features removable spikes around the sides and heel.
The overall look of the shoe is meant to evoke the Pacific Northwest in homage to Seamus Golf’s Oregon roots, with its mix of materials and textures inspired by a custom golf bag from the company’s founder Akbar Chisti.
“We built our reputation by creating unique, made to order products of impeccable style and quality,” Chisti explains in a press release. “When you see the originality and character of our products in person, it elevates the ‘Wow’ factor to another level. This shoe is no exception. We’re humbled to have inspired this one of a kind golf shoe.”
The Seamus x Nike Golf Air Zoom Victory Tour will launch on Thursday, December 12 at 7 a.m. PST for $200 USD, and will be available from both Nike and Seamus Golf‘s online stores.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">END. Clothing and American sportswear giants New Balance have teamed up once again on a collaborative pair of sneakers, this time around delivering the 997 “Persian Rug.”
The 997 “Persian Rug” follows on from the duo’s recent technically-indebted 860 V2 and its sophisticated 878 “Grey Gull,” with END. taking a more traditional approach with a “Rumba Red” colorway contrasted by navy and cream panels. It’s constructed from suede, leather and mesh under New Balance’s premium Made in USA division, a detail so prominent that it has been embroidered atop of the sneaker’s tongue.
Throughout the sneaker, you’ll find no detail left unfinished. Inspired by the ornate nature of Persian rugs — which date back to the 5th Century BC — END. has complemented the original colors found on the sneaker with an insole printed with a traditional Middle Eastern pattern that also finds itself encompassing the box.
Rounding out this unique collaborative pair is New Balance’s legendary ENCAP technology in the sole unit, providing a supportive and comfort-enhancing wear, as well as insole branding. Take a look at the END. Clothing x New Balance 997 “Persian Rug” in the gallery above, and sign up online to be in with a chance of purchasing the pair for $225 USD when it releases on December 14.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re the type of person who strategically eats all your meat, veg and potatoes just to savour every last bite of your gravy-soaked Yorkshire pudding at the end of a roast, then I have some delicious news for you.
The ‘first ever’ Yorkshire pudding festival is coming to the UK, and you don’t even need to pay anything for the privilege.
Yorkie pudding lovers will unite at the Kirkgate Market in Leeds City Centre on February 1, 2020, to sample and buy from a delicious assortment of the batter-based delicacies.
One of the kitchens taking part in the eagerly anticipated festival is Kang’s Punjabi Box, who will be stuffing their puddings with authentic spice-laced Indian cuisine.
I’ll be honest, I’m not usually a huge fan of mixing dishes together, like the Sunday roast pizza for example, but a curry in a Yorkie sounds like the culinary combination I’ve been waiting for my entire life.
Meanwhile, the Nan’s Van & Kitchen will be dishing out fresh, fluffy Yorkshires from its 1970s converted Rice horse box.
Although the festival is free to attend, visitors will be able to purchase their Yorkshire pudding goodies from local and family businesses as well as independent food producers, meaning a cheeky visit will certainly be worth your while.
As per the festival’s Eventbrite description:
It is fittingly described as a ‘celebration’ of Yorkshire puddings, which is only fair for what they call ‘an essential part of the nation’s roast dinners’. You’re not wrong, you are not bloody wrong.
You can make your way down any time between 10am and 4pm.
Meanwhile, like I mentioned earlier, a restaurant has created a roast dinner pizza, complete with Yorkshire puddings and all the trimmings.
Zerodegrees brewery and restaurant created the personalised pizza, which comes with a topping of either chicken, lamb or pork, alongside a Yorkshire pudding, broccoli, roast potatoes and parsnips, topped with mint, apple or horseradish sauce and a boat of gravy on the side.
The almighty dish, for which the jury is most certainly still out, comes to around 700 calories, meaning you’d better be feeling hungry if you want to polish the whole thing off. After all, it is basically two different dishes all in one.
According to Zerodegrees brewery, the 23-inch pizza is currently only being served on Sundays and is the only roast dinner item on the menu, so they say it’s perfect for people who are trying to mix up their usual weekend tradition.
If you fancy having a go for yourself to find out what all the fuss is about, the twist on the classic is available at Zerodegrees restaurants in Bristol, Blackheath, Reading and Cardiff, and costs less than £15.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Devon winery to supply supermarket giants with sparkling wine for Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Devon winery is teaming up with Aldi to provide the supermarket giant with sparkling wine in time for Christmas.
Lyme Bay Winery is working on the English sparkling wine for the supermarket’s ‘Exquisite Collection’.
The ‘Lyme Block Sparkling Brut Reserve’ launches on December 9, in time for the vital Christmas and New Year period for sparkling wine sales.
The new wine follows on from the success of the ‘Lyme Block English Wine’, launched in March and then a ‘Lyme Block Bacchus’.
These wines remain the only collaboration to date with an English producer by Aldi and the only English wines the retailer has included in their ‘Exquisite Collection’.
The Lyme Block Sparkling Brut Reserve will be the first own label English Sparkling Wine to be recognised as part of their premium offer.
Lyme Bay Winery and the team at Aldi have delivered a dry, clean and vibrant wine with crisp acidity, bursting with lemon, apple and freshly cut grass.
It’s a fresh and fruity sparkler, making it the perfect drink for celebratory occasions whether matched with food or as an aperitif.
Julie Ashfield, Managing Director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: “Given the success of our Exquisite Collection Lyme Block English Wine and Lyme Block Bacchus, we are thrilled to be working again with Lyme Bay Winery.
“We are sure this elegant sparkling wine will be a hit with our customers this Christmas, especially as English Wines are gaining a reputation as some of the best in the world.”
The sparkling wine is made from a blend of Pinot Noir, Seyval Blanc, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay and Reichensteiner, all from English vineyards. Only the finest press cuts are used and, after an extended cold settle, the wine is fermented at cool temperatures to maintain the freshness of the grapes.
Sara Walters for Lyme Bay Winery commented: “We are thrilled to continue our collaboration with Aldi by extending the Lyme Block range. They are a retailer that has rightly earned a reputation for delivering excellent wines and to be part of that is a privilege for us.”
James Lambert, managing director at Lyme Bay Winery added: “We are very proud of this wine, it really delivers, balancing citrus and toasty flavours with a consistent vibrancy.
“It is an elegant and refined choice for anyone planning their festive celebrations.”
The wine is available online from  www.aldi.co.uk  from 9 December priced at £16.99.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first proper Wonder Woman 1984 trailer has dropped, and it’s a good’un.
The trailer, below, debuted today at CCXP Brazil. In it, you’ll get great glimpses of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Chris Pine as (surprise!) a returned-from-the-dead (?) Steve Trevor and a look at Kristen Wiig pre-Cheetah as Barbara Minerva.
As you’ll also be able to see (and hear), there’s a huge 80s vibe going down… and is that the same mall from Stranger Things or do they all seriously just look the same?
Wonder Woman 1984 heads to theatres in the northern hemisphere summer of 2020 (so winter here in Australia).

    <h5 class="mb-1">HP's Pocket Printer Is Let Down By Its Photo Quality And Location Data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The HP Sprocket Select is a pocket photo printer that prints sticker photos via a bluetooth phone app. It's adorable. Fun, even. But it's also a device you're likely to use a handful of times, and then hide away in a bedroom drawer until the end of time.
The Sprocket Select is easy to use and hooks up with a mobile app so you can print off any photos you might have lurking in the bowels of your phone memory. The Sprock app is great, and easily connects with the print and allows you to print off any photo saved to your camera reel. This was the part I liked most about it, because in our all-digital everything age, my mobile photos often stay on my phone and rarely see the light.
With the Sprocket Select, I could print out a few of my favourite memories on tiny 2.3 x 3.4-inch photo stickers and hang them around my room. It was nice, but the Sprocket is held back by a few key things.
First, I was briefly mystified when I got the Sprocket. It's a tiny printer! It's really cute, and you can print anything you want off it and turn it into stickers. But then I realised I could do the exact same thing on my home printer, and with far better and more reliable results. The photo quality of the stickers that the Sprocket prints isn't good.
Photos are compressed and small and the colours are muddy and plain. Images that popped on my screen printed out grainy and unsaturated, and the Sprocket printer had particular issues with greys and browns, making them look drab and washed out. It also pixelated and compressed every image I printed, making darker scenes look barely comprehensible.
While it's hard to exactly replicate the colour tones and contrast via a photo of a photo, the left image (a photo of the Sprocket photo) should give you an idea of how the Sprocket washes out colour and detail during printing. On the odd photo, it also completely panicked, washing out and smudging the bottom of images as the data arrived.
This was the seventh photo I printed, although I wasn't able to replicate the effect. For a printer designed to, y'know, print... that's not great.
There's also another issue, and it's a significant one. The Sprocket printers include a feature called 'Reveal' to imprint an invisible watermark on your printed photo that embeds certain data including the location the photo was taken. This data can be read by anyone who has the Sprocket app, and they can then access the Google Street View data of the location, if it's available. While this may not be such an issue if you're using the Sprocket to print photos of a trip to Japan, printing out a selfie you took from your bedroom could give people a direct line to your house.
It's definitely something to keep in mind when using the Reveal feature on the Sprocket. While it requires you to opt-in, those using the device should be careful about sharing this kind of data, even if it appears relatively harmless.
Thankfully, it's easy enough to avoid this feature.
Simply put, the Sprocket Select feels like a device that belongs in the 90s. While the photo stickers it prints are fun for scrapbookers or those looking for a neat memento of their travels, the poor quality of the printed photos holds the device back. For a $199 printer, I expected much better.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Think there are too many kinds of milk these days? Relate to the protagonists of Bon Jovi ballads with no sense of irony? Saddle up steel cowboy, and climb into this bitchin’ pickup truck with 770 HP and an interior to match your ill-fitting pleather jacket.
I love a hot street truck as much as the next Coors Light-crushing American–in fact, pour one on the pavement for the deceased SVT Lightning–but the Shelby F-150 Super Snake Sport here looks like a goofy Need For Speed: Underground reject. But if you were wondering how many nostrils is too many nostrils, I think, maybe, this many.
Somebody liked this idea enough to authorise 250 to be built, so, behold the fury of a 770-horsepower version of the Shelby Super Snake (now with optional four-wheel drive!) Hard tonneau covers I could go either way on, and I think we can appreciate the fact that this one is “different,” but the duckbill spoiler is wack and so is the wheel:brake size ratio. (That said, Shelby’s claiming a 0 to 100 to 0 mph time of 8.3 seconds).
This truck would be perfect for making loud and dangerous parking lot exits. Which, in fairness, is kind of what all street trucks are optimised for. It’s not how I’d spend $US93,385 ($136,521) but if you don’t mind slumming it with no supercharger and a paltry 395 HP, the base naturally aspirated ’Snake starts at $US86,085 ($125,849).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Local cuisine is a significant element of a country's essence that influences many aspects of its culture, lifestyle and people.Turkish cuisine is one of the most celebrated and promoted worldwide, and the Culture and Tourism Ministry has announced that 2020 will be celebrated as the "Year of Turkish Cuisine" with panel sessions, competitions, workshops and many other related events to be held around the globe.The culinary delights of Turkey are defined by its culture and history. Hailing from Central Asia, Turks brought their traditional food to Anatolia as well as adopting the already existing culinary traditions as their own.Anatolia is a melting pot of different cultures, which has most definitely been reflected in its cuisine. Everywhere you go, you can come across different recipes and ways of executing these recipes. For instance, while southern Turkey boasts kebabs and various dishes made with meat, western Turkey relies more on Mediterranean cuisine with its vegetables and olive oil.As a part of the celebrations, from seafood to kebabs, Turkish chefs will demonstrate their talent by promoting this diverse side of Turkish cuisine. If you have not tried Turkish food or believe that Turkish cuisine is only famous for its kebabs, get ready to be taken on a culinary journey to happy-belly heaven in 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart’s Santa Sweater Scandal (And The Challenges Of Marketplace Operation)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Generally speaking, if a retailer is issuing an apology during the holiday season that features the words “Santa Claus,” “cocaine” and “pants-free” it is safe to assume things have gone pretty badly off the rails somewhere.
And Walmart finds itself issuing just such an apology this week, though the actual circumstances are somewhat less dramatic than the various headlines on the topic.
According to reporting in the New York Post over the weekend, Walmart is officially apologizing to consumers for an adults-only Christmas sweater that by all appearances features Santa about to snort what looks to be cocaine, with the phrase “Let It Snow” plastered across the top. The item’s description on the page clarified that the image on the sweater was exactly what it looks like.
“We all know how snow works. It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America,” the description read. “That’s bad news for jolly old St. Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole. That’s why Santa really likes to savor the moment when he gets his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.”
On the upside, the item only seems to have appeared on Walmart Canada’s site and seems to have come care of a marketplace seller, not the main brand. Nonetheless, Walmart is very, very sorry.
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” a spokesperson told the outlet.” We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offense this may have caused.”
Walmart, for good measure, also removed some other Santa-themed sweaters of questionable appropriateness including one that featured a pants-less Santa roasting his “chestnuts” in front of a fireplace.
The lesson Walmart has learned? Marketplaces are a great way to create the endless aisles effect consumer have come to love. But endless aisles come with a price — if one doesn’t keep a close eye on those marketplace sellers and what exactly they are putting out there, it might mean apologizing to the world for the items that end up on the shelf.

    <h5 class="mb-1">American-style sweet shop opens up in Derby suburb</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Derby sweet shop has relocated, increased its line of products and introduced longer opening hours.
The store, which first started trading at Intu Derby in September, has seen some new improvements with a bigger and better menu, longer opening hours and a delivery service across Derby.
You can now find Captain Flavours, which specialises in sweets from America and imaginative candy creations, in Brighton Road, Alvaston.
Sweet-toothed shoppers can get their sugar fix late at night as the store's new opening hours are Thursday to Sunday, 1pm until 10pm.
Dan Khalifa, owner of the business, said from setting up on Instagram and turning his dreams into reality, he's since had an "amazing journey".
The 24-year-old said: "From starting to sell American snacks and drinks via Instagram and delivering them around Derby to then opening my first shop in the city centre.
"Now I've moved into a bigger and better shop. I couldn’t have done this without my followers and supporters continuously showing love."
Dan, who is in his second year of business studies at the University of Derby, started up his company from home last year.
He bought stock and shared his colourful creations on his growing Instagram page, which now has over 5,000 followers.
There are a plethora of sweet creations to explore and the store offers customers the opportunity to personalise their toppings.
The shop sells a range of treats from slush and soda floats, ice cream trays, to milkshakes and cookie dough trays.
Dan added: "Business and entrepreneurship is all about taking risks to create opportunities with the hope of prospering and that’s exactly what I did.
"I moved from the city centre because I took the opportunity to create something that would give my customers and the people of Derby an even better Captain Flavours experience. I now offer a more enhanced menu, easier accessibility, a delivery service and longer opening hours. "But, most importantly, I’m making people happy with what I do and that’s what I love.
"I want to thank the locals in Alvaston for giving me such a warm welcome into the community and I also want to thank the Derby Telegraph for giving me the opportunity to get my business and voice heard."The new location is 384 Brighton Road, DE24 8TF. Come down and explore your imagination.”
The store, which offers a taste of the United States, first opened its doors in Intu Derby on Thursday, September 19.
The new shop opened in Alvaston on Friday, December 6.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Dash Air Fryer Is Down To $69.99 Today</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day today, it is also discounting the Dash Air Fryer. It is now just $69.99, saving you $30 off of its regular price. This does bring it back down to its all-time lowest price. Making it a great time to pick one up.
As part of the Gold Box Deal of the Day, this price will only be on sale today, and will expire at midnight PST. So you're going to want to get before the end of the day, if you want it at $69.99.
The Dash Air Fryer is going to be a pretty popular gift this holiday season, primarily because air fryers are popular right now, and this one is fairly cheap.

This particular model is a three-quart model. So it's not going to hold a ton of food, but there's enough space in there for a good amount of fries or chicken to have fried.
There are also eight presets available on the Dash Air Fryer. So you can take the guess work out of your food prep. It'll always come out crispy and very tasty. And this all happens in less time than it takes to pre-heat your oven.
With the Dash Air Fryer, you're going to get healthier food too. Since you're not frying it in a pot full of oil, you're taking all of that fat out of the equation here. In fact, takes out about 70-80% of the fat out of french fries and fried chicken. Now that is pretty impressive, if you ask me. This means that you can still have your favorite fried foods, without clogging your arteries with all of that oil. That's a win/win for everyone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Every driver aspires to get the dream car of their own and fantasizes about having the perfect car for their own liking; however, should their dream be a reality?
Unfortunately, sometimes in the quest to making the perfect car, some mishaps can be made and the car of your dreams might be nightmare fuel for everyone else.
Maybe your cringeworthy modifications are better off staying in your imagination - not on the road. It is always good to double-check.
Modifications don't have to stop at adding engine sounds to your car too, there are people out there with their minds set on torturing defenseless pushbikes, pick-up trucks, and motorbikes. Not only some of these designs render the vehicles useless, but they are also just plain ridiculous.  
SEE ALSO: 11 SPECTACULAR VEHICLE DESIGNS DRAWN AND REIMAGINED BY CHILDREN
We have collected some of the worst car modification fails that can be found on the internet: from furry covering to Patrick wheels, here are 15 hilariously hideous Pimp My Ride attempts made by car-enthusiasts from everywhere in the world. 
Don't get us wrong, we love SpongeBob as much as the next guy. However, it seems that this driver took things a little bit too far. 
Also, call us racist but we won’t go into that car with Patrick on the wheel.
The furry trend expanded to fashion, and then, to your bedroom with your partner suddenly demanding you to wear a lion tail in bed. And now, apparently, the trend jumped to the highways.
At least the impact will be softer if you hit a distracted pedestrian.
Disclaimer: Don't hit a distracted pedestrian!
This car is from the R rated Cars movie that will never be made: the drunk car that always looks tired, steam is coming off from its hood, and the scene ends with its wheels giving out with x's over its eyes.
But in fashion, of course. 
This is how your morning commute looks like when you wanted to be a pirate but your parents made you study arrrchitecture.
We will see us out.
It appears that someone stole that giant toddler's toy car and we hope that he doesn't throw a tantrum when he sees this.
Also, this is the only car that goes vroom vroom and beep beep in this list.
The first glance tells you it is from a video game, the second lets you know it is the reality. We do admit it does kinda look sick; however, was it really necessary?
With this design, it won’t be your wingman that’s for sure.
We are going to assume that this car was designed to give you the best shoveling snow experience of your life. Otherwise, there is no explanation for that abomination.
This might be the car for all your Turkish bath needs. Just don't go too heavy on the soap and you will be just fine. 
The exterior of this car is screaming wealth, we can only hope that the interior is not. Sitting on coins is a happy thought that comes with instant butt pain.  
This car is not safe for work, job interviews, visiting your partner's parents, etc. In a nutshell, just don't use this car while going anywhere. 
This is the car you should get if you really don't trust your driving skills, like, at all. Or maybe, you want to make your love known to that special someone by Thelma and Louise'ing both of you down a cliff. 
Either way, don't do this design or we are calling the cops. 
This is the car a pope would have bought if he was the reincarnation of a pimp. It looks terrible, but at least it has a shower installed for after the deed is done.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Niall Horan explained the Irish tradition of the '12 Pubs of Christmas' while on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon
The 12 Pubs of Christmas is a favorite all around Ireland during December that sees groups of merrymakers visit a dozen pubs in one night.

It may sound like a recipe for disaster but thankfully, boyband member turned bona fide pop star Niall Horan explained to Jimmy Fallon that the celebration is more than just about drinking and that it's actually a great way to catch up with old friends.
Horan, who told Fallon he usually only gets back home to Ireland once or twice a year, says he's looking forward to going home for the holidays.
“We always do like … all my mates from school, there’s like 15 or 16 of us, and we do this thing called The 12 Pubs of Christmas.
“So basically there’s 26 pubs in one mile in my hometown, and there’s about 14,000 people, so it’s well spread you know? You’ve got room in the pub when you go in.
"So you just go round, and there’s rules, like between [pubs] four and five you have to link arms with one of your mates and walk backwards to the next pub, and you have a certain amount of time to drink.
“We should make it into a documentary. I would watch it.”
"It sounds like a Hallmark movie to me," said Fallon.

Horan also explained that the traditional Irish Christmas feast falls very much in line with the generic US version with turkey, ham and of course, “all the different types of potatoes.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Percy Pig Advent Calendars Are Filled With Chocolate and We Might as Well Just Give Up on Life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The legendary Percy Pig has a spiffy looking advent calendar that might as well be filled with nothing.
I can't imagine a worse affront that walking into your local M&S, spotting Percy's rosy face grinning at you from the front of his very own advent calendar of all things (no, YOU shut up!), grabbing a stack for the fam - because who doesn't want to gobble up his gummies - and opening door number one to find a piece of chocolate behind it.
What. The. Actual. Fuck. A Percy Pig advent calendar, with no Percy fucking Pigs in it? Has anything worse happened anywhere on this planet at any point in human history? No.
There's nothing left to do now but to rip all the doors off, scattering those putrid chocolates everywhere, and stuff handfuls of the numbered cardboard pieces down your throat to end your gummy-less misery. But what's this? Something else printed on the front, in large font, right next to Percy's rotund little body.
"24 festive milk chocolate shapes and a bag of Percy Pigs for Christmas day."
Even as you begin to slip away, the meaning of these words elude you. Because you're an absolute cretin.
Apparently this drama has been playing out (probably) in a number of homes across the country, and some poor social media manager over and Marks and Sparks is running our of palms and faces to smash together in the face of complaints from people whose Christmas is ruined because they can't figure out a workaround for their own idiocy - by, say, buying a bag of Percy Pigs - and won't cop up to the fact that they bought something with the contents clearly marked, failed to pay any attention to that whatsoever, and made it someone else's fault.
Metro has curated a fine selection of angry comments from customers who are still oblivious, even now. Just open door number 25, or go and buy another bag. Heck, go and buy a bag for every day of the month and save Christmas like some porcine gummy saint. Enjoy.

This staggering £15 max combi deal contains 150 separate items, with the suggested serving advice being that this preformed foodmass could feed a festive party of 15 joy-filled, party-popper-popping people, all genuinely happy to be there, and their lives unfolding like a TV advert as they wonder what might be in the next amazing crispy parcel. The content of the carry-out of shame is customisable too, with purchasers able to select the filling and overall flavor of the many and varied brown foodstuffs on offer. Branded colas and crisps of fine repute are also included.
Spring rolls may even be purchased for any vegetarians brave enough to attend outside gatherings, and if you choose flavours wisely some Pringles are even vegan. Something for everyone is therefore on offer here. [Iceland via Yahoo]

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Do You Justify This Super-Pricey Smart Mug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An average mug costs between £2 and £5, while a nice travel mug goes for around £10-£20, or maybe a little more if you’re feeling fancy. So how on earth does a company justify a smart mug that costs well over £100?
While it might sound outlandish, this question isn’t purely hypothetical, because thanks to the Ember’s second-gen Travel Mug, the value of a smart mug is something that actually needs to be examined. So what makes this travel mug so smart?
Like a normal travel mug, Ember’s smart mug features an insulated body that holds 12 ounces of liquid along with a leak-proof lid to prevent anything from spilling out during your commute. The lid has a springy push-button cap that you can push to open, and then push again to close. It’s a simple set up, but very effective, because even when I turned the mug upside down while it was full of water, not a single drop leaked out.
The rest of the mug’s exterior sports a really nice soft-touch finish, along with a hidden dot-matrix display for displaying things like temperature, battery status, and more. But the Travel Mug’s real smarts lie in a built-in heater that allows the mug to keep your drink piping hot (between about 50 and 62.5 degrees Celsius), unlike a normal travel mug that simply tries to keep heat from escaping.

The basic idea is that for people who have a long commute, you won’t have to worry about your coffee or tea getting icy. And thanks to a battery that lasts for about three hours on a charge, it’ll probably keep your beverage at the right temp for a while after that. And if you want to boost the temp of your drink a bit, you can do that do, with the Travel Mug generally taking around 10 to 15 minutes to raise the temp of your beverage by 5 degrees.
To expand on its heating capabilities, there’s also a free Ember app (available for Android and iOS) that connects to the Travel Mug via Bluetooth, which you can use to set the temp of the mug, give your mug a name (I named mine Spicy Mug), or select from a number of presets for various drinks like lattes, different types of tea, coffee and cappuccino. The app even has a tea timer to help you keep track of steeping times, and a handful of recipes for making drinks like a beet latte, golden turmeric milk, and others. That said, at the time of writing, there are only five total recipes in the app, which isn’t exactly a great selection.

Thankfully, all of the Travel Mug’s most important features can be adjusted without the app, simply by tapping the Ember logo to scroll through various settings or statuses, and then using touch controls to adjust the temperature of your drink if need be. The mug will also automatically turn itself off if you’re not using it, to help preserve battery life. And when you need to recharge the mug, you can simply place it on top of its wireless charging cradle (which comes included), so you can keep a drink warm indefinitely, or simply recharge the mug before your next commute.
All in all, the Travel Mug works almost exactly as advertised, it’s a simple straightforward device that keeps drinks hot for up to three hours (or a bit less when if you turn it on full blast) and makes sure your drink stays inside the mug and no on your shirt in case your commute gets a little bumpy. However, at the same time, the Travel Mug’s skill set is also what lets it down.
That’s because while the Travel Mug’s heater can totally keep a drink warm or increase its temp by 5 or 10 degrees, you’re still reliant on a kettle or some other hot water source to supply the mug with an initial reservoir of hot liquid. If you could use Ember’s Travel Mug to boil water anywhere to make tea or instant coffee, suddenly the mug’s $180 price tag would seem a lot less ridiculous.

The Travel Mug’s lid is surprisingly secure, but I still wouldn’t just toss the thing in a bag if it’s full of liquid. (Photo: Sam Rutherford/Gizmodo)
Unfortunately, while this might seem like a simple request, it’s hard to bend the rules of physics. Water just isn’t a very good conductor of heat, and it takes a lot of energy to heat water from room temp to boiling, especially the closer you get to 100 degrees. So if a company was to make some kind of portable kettle travel mug hybrid, it would need a battery so large the device probably wouldn’t be portable anymore. What a bummer.
My other issue with the Travel Mug is that, ideally, you need two charging coasters: one at home and another at the office. This way you can make sure the mug always has a full charge before you head out, while also taking full advantage of the Travel Mug’s all-day heating abilities, no matter where you are. But sadly, only one charging coaster comes in the box, and if you want a second one, it’ll cost you an additional $28 (£21). This pushes the Travel Mug’s total price to $208 (£158), which is a big ask even for coffee or tea fanatics who want to make sure their beverage tastes juuust right.
The Travel Mug will also let you know when your drink is cold, in case you didn’t already know. (Photo: Sam Rutherford/Gizmodo)
Thankfully, if you’re not concerned about keeping your drink warm during your commute, Ember also makes a regular heated smart mug without the extra insulation or leak-proof top that goes for £130, which if you only care about keeping your drinks warm, makes a lot more sense, both practically and financially.
It’s kind of weird when a product does exactly what it claims to do, and yet you’re still kinda of disappointed. The second-gen Ember Travel Mug is a well-built device that makes sipping coffee or tea just a bit more enjoyable, regardless of whether you’re sitting at home or on the way to work, but it’s also 10 times the price of a normal travel mug. Some people might say that’s a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a mug, and it is! But I’m not here to tell you how to spend your money. The mug is nice and it does its job, but for $180, I just wish the travel mug offered a bit more value.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that my MacBook can't even look at sideways with it it turning into a steaming slagheap of aluminum and silicon. The RPG, in it's PC and Mac iterations asks for too much for my poor laptop's increasingly outclassed 15 processor. Happily, I discovered that it's available for my Nintendo Switch, albeit with significantly scaled-down graphics (there'll be a review coming later.). I downloaded it the other night and, with the snow coming down hard enough here in west central Alberta's back country today, I spent around an 90 minutes playing the game.
I scarcely made any progress. It was lovely.
There's something about many modern games that gnaws at me. Even in open-world games, I feel like a fire's lit under my ass to get things done. Skin 15 whatzitbeasts. With minimal motivation, kill the outlaws camped on the outskirts of town of town (becasue the well armed local garrison can't handle them.) Go where you want to, but do these things. In. A. Timely. Manner. Even my favorite games of the past few years—Fallout 4 and Skyrim—which let you wander and do whatever, still do what they can to make you feel like there's shit that needs doing, yesterday. So far, and admittedly, it's early into the game, Divinity: Original Sin 2 hasn't made me feel this way. Perhaps it's that the narrative is slowed down by forcing gamers to read and consider their responses to NPCs. You have to consider your responses to everything, really: taking an NPC into your party when you're unsure of their motivations can change the course of the game. Arming your group with the wrong weapons and armor or using your resources with abandon can screw you down the road. Pause. Read. Think. Act. Or maybe say fuck it until later and learn how to craft something. This sensation of a lazy riverboat ride of a gaming experience is helped along by the fact that, on battery power, you can only play for two hours at a time. That's a pittance for a game that offers close to 200 hours of gameplay. So far, I haven't felt rushed. I don't want to keep playing all night. But I'm looking forward to coming back to the deep world building that the game's writer's have worked their asses off for and the enjoyable, liesurely pace that the game has offered me so far.
Slow, for me at least, is where it's at.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The bummers of adulthood are too many to count, but one of our least favorites is the inability to sit down and enjoy a nice bowl of cereal. When you've got a long commute ahead, let's face it: That extra time it takes to pour the milk and chow down is too precious to spare.
That's why we're putting the CrunchCup™ Portable Cereal Cup on our Christmas list this year.
The simple genius behind this thing is pretty impressive. It consists of two cups—one nested inside the other. You pour your milk into the bigger one, then your cereal of choice into the smaller one. Screw on the top, then take it on the road.
The cover on the lid gives you enough space for a hearty bite with every sip, and it combines the two on the way to your mouth. It might even be a better solution than the traditional bowl if you're the type of eater who likes to keep their cereal crispy.
The CrunchCup™ Portable Cereal Cup is on sale now for 33% off the original price, and you can knock an additional 20% off that by using the holiday coupon code GREENMONDAY20.

    <h5 class="mb-1">7 home trends from the 2010s that will disappear, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Yellow interior paint combined with yellow temperature lighting needs to stay in this decade,” the team from Transition State, a Los Angeles-based design label, told Insider.
“Since 2010, that style has evolved into a much lighter, airy feeling ranging from the weight of furniture pieces to the drapery and print,” Transition State said.
“I’m pretty sure that painted floors will not be returning,” Ashley Quinn, the vice president of creative marketing at Interior Marketing Group, told Insider of the trend.
You probably won’t see homes with “an overwhelming amount of plants” in the 2020s, according to Transition State.
While greenery will likely still be used as a decor piece, filling every corner of a home with plants probably won’t be commonplace again.
While barn doors did make for a cute addition to a space, they’re likely not going to be popular moving forward.
According to Apartment Therapy, barn doors aren’t functional, making them unappealing to people.
Mason jars entered the design sphere as an accent to the farmhouse aesthetic, particularly as wedding decor, but overuse of the trend has rendered them obsolete.
“We’re ready to leave that behind,” the Transition State team said of the trend.
Though it seemed like it would last forever, the millennial pink trend is over, according to Elle Decor.
Joe Berkowitz of Jab Design Group told Insider that neutral colors like gray, beige, and white will win out over bright, trendy hues.
“What used to be known as a pop in a room now tends to make a space feel unfinished and underwhelming,” the Transition State team said of accent walls.
“Everything comes back eventually,” Berkowitz said. “I have been in this industry for 30 years and I have witnessed that firsthand.”
For instance, wallpaper had a renaissance in the 2010s, which Berkowitz has loved. “The selection that has been made available to us is incredibly beautiful, varied, and creative.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you recently spent some quality time on the couch binge-watching the latest season of Netflix’s hit show “Stranger Things,” you’re not alone. And if you’re already missing the beloved Hawkins gang, you’re not alone either.
Thankfully, there’s plenty of super-cool merch for the “Stranger Things” superfan in your life (or for yourself – we won’t judge) to tide you over until the fourth season.
Help decorate their Christmas tree with a fun oversized ornament inspired by the show. It’s handmade and you can customize the color of the ball ornament to complement their tree. The seller also donates 10% of all sales to the Humane Society of the United States.
There are so many hidden details in these shoes that they won’t find everything for weeks. The sneakers also come in a shoebox lined with a copy of The Hawkins Post from July 3, 1985.
Creepy yet cool, the candle’s wax goes through Eleven’s nostrils as it melts.
Barb deserved more. For everyone who’s still mourning, this book is filled with Barb-isms like life advice, style tips, and more.
Send your friends to the Upside Down or bring them back to the Right Side Up with this fun game.
They’ll love the retro look of this handheld game, but don’t be surprised if they won’t share.
LEGO lovers can build their own “Stranger Things” scene with this 2,000+ piece set. The kit includes both the real-world and Upside Down version of the Byers home. Eight mini-figures are included – Eleven, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Will, Byers, Hopper, and the Demogorgon as well as a variety of accessories like Lucas’ slingshot, Dustin’s walkie-talkie, and yes, Eleven’s waffle.
This pool float is not for the faint of heart. This 6-foot long Demogorgon inflatable is a perfect pool centerpiece for those who aren’t scared of what lives in the Upside Down.
There has been a big uptick in interest in Dungeons and Dragons thanks to the kids in “Stranger Things” being such huge fans of the classic role-playing game. This set is an ideal way to start your own epic adventure. And yes, a Demogorgon is included.
Coke reformulated its classic drink to be sweeter in 1985, unofficially calling it New Coke. No one liked it (except Lucas), so the company reverted to its original formula just three months later and renamed it Coke II. It was officially pulled from shelves in 2002, but now, thanks to “Stranger Things,” it’s back for a limited time.
Make that pool time a bit more whimsical with these boat-shaped drink floats, an ode to the sailor hats at the ice cream shop Scoops Ahoy. Each set includes two floats.
Even though she hasn’t been around during the last two seasons, we still miss Barb. Nancy Wheeler’s best friend may have met her demise in the Upside Down during season one, but her memory is still alive on this Missing Milk Carton Beach Blanket.
If you are hungry for Dustin’s Roast Beef T-shirt as seen in “Stranger Things” season three, here’s a way to satisfy your cravings. This cotton shirt, inspired by one that Dustin wore, is a subtle way to show you’re a superfan.
Forget about capturing those moments on your iPhone, go old school with a Polaroid. This special version of the retro camera comes in a special color combo and camera text printed upside down, of course.
Pretend you’re at the Palace Arcade with this handheld retro game unit. This mini arcade, decorated includes 20 classic games from the ’80s like Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and more.
Baskin-Robbins created a few different flavors of ice cream as a tie-in with the new season and fictional ice cream parlor Scoops Ahoy. If you didn’t get a chance to scoop up a pint of the real deal, you can still get the Scoops Ahoy USS Butterscotch slime instead.
To celebrate the new season, Nike partnered with show to create a line of clothing and shoes. The line was wildly popular, especially the Tailwind 79 sneakers, and much of it has sold out immediately, but you can still score a few key pieces like this Hawkins school hoodie.
Chia Pets are always fun, but Chia Bets in the shape of fan-favorite Dustin is just epic. The terracotta planter features a smiling Dusty with his iconic baseball cap, and the greenery grows to become his trademark curly hair.
Mike, Will, Dustin, and Lucas take their bikes everywhere. It’s hard not to get jealous watching them peeling away, especially with such sweet rides. If you wanna hit the road like Lucas, you can with this Schwinn replica bike that even has a retro-style banana seat with a camo bandana just like Lucas wears.
There’s a whole bunch of Funko figures featuring the crew from “Stranger Things,” but this new one with Eleven in her super-’80s outfit is our favorite.
Or try a blind bag of one of the character. Half the fun is the mystery behind which character they’d get.
Levi’s went to its archives to create an ’80s-inspired collection paying homage to the era of “Stranger Things.” Most of the collection is already sold out, but you can grab a pair of the Dad Jeans featuring images of favorite “Stranger Things” characters and an upside down Levi’s patch.
Think you know “Stranger Things?” Test your knowledge about the show and the decade it takes place in with this special Trivial Pursuit Board game. This edition even has an Upside Down option where winners lose pie pieces if they get the answer wrong.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to Use a Camera to Measure Foot-Candles of Light for Houseplants</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Do you love both photography and houseplants? If so, did you know that you can easily use your camera to measure the intensity of the light falling on your plants?In the United States, optimal light intensity for houseplants is often discussed in foot-candles (and for those of you more familiar with lux, 1 foot-candle is about 10.76 lux).
If you don’t want to buy a dedicated light meter for your houseplants (and haven’t needed one for your photography), you can also gauge light intensity using just your camera (if it has a built-in light meter and manual controls) and a sheet of ordinary white paper.
First, set your camera’s mode to aperture priority (Av), sensitivity to ISO 100 and aperture to f/8.
Next, hold the sheet of white paper right in front of a plant’s leaves so that the light is hitting the sheet of paper instead of the plant. Hold the camera in front of the sheet of paper (not further than the width of the paper) while doing your best not to cast any shadows.
Now meter with your camera and see what it recommends as the shutter speed for correct exposure. Use the chart below to convert the result to foot-candles:
These numbers are based on a handy online calculator by the store First Rays. You can use the calculator if you’d like to figure out foot-candles for different combinations of ISO, aperture, and shutter speed.
There you have it: a quick way to measure foot-candles using the camera you already have. Happy houseplant growing (and photo shooting)!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gifts for musicians: affordable Christmas present ideas for music-makers (which they'll actually use)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Buying gifts for musicians can seem like an artform in itself. We musos are a paradoxical bunch: both indulging in the fantasy that we’re escaping the corporate world, while simultaneously getting very excited about shiny new things.
Similarly, the best musicians are masters of communication, however, ask us what we want for our next birthday or Christmas present and the responding jargon can sound like an alien language, especially once you get past the first instrument stage of the process. And even if you can handle the tech talk, the gear is often prohibitively expensive.
Essentially, we get it: we’re awkward. Let us extend an olive branch then, as we offer up some gift ideas that should have real appeal to the music-maker in your life. 
In this guide to the best gifts for musicians we've covered everything from guitar gifts, ideas for DJs, gifts for drummers and loads more.
Got a laptop? Got an instrument? This is what you need to get recording
High quality metal chassisRepresents excellent valueSimple, easy-to-use controls
Widely agreed to be one of the best entry-level audio interfaces (for non-musos: the thing that connects your instrument/microphone to your computer to record), the iD4 benefits from Audient’s excellent mic preamp and offers remarkable value for money. There are two inputs, meaning that it’s easy to simultaneously record vocals and guitar. This is a great way to get started in the recording world.

The mini amp that punches above its weight
Sounds way bigger than it looksLoads of tone shaping controlsAux-input
The mini amp market has grown incredibly competitive in recent years, but Boss’ Katana Mini still holds its own and would make the ideal gift for the guitarist in your life. It’s battery-powered, offers three channels (clean, brown and crunch) and a three-band EQ. Most importantly, it’s portable, affordable and sounds way better than any amp should at this price.
On a budget? These are the best guitar amps under £/$500
The go-to entry-level recording microphone
Solid buildExcellent valueA great all-rounder for home recording
Since it’s launch in 2006, the Audio Technica AT2020 Cardioid Condenser Microphone has become a firm fixture in home studios all over the world. At a time when home recording has been booming, few others have been able to rival its balance of sound, rock-solid construction and low price point. The latest model - AT2020USB+ - is a great option for quick and easy digital recording.

The indispensable tool for any vocalist
Gooseneck arm makes adjustments easyMetal mesh won’t tear
A pop shield? Yeah, it’s not the most glamorous piece of equipment, but when it comes to gifts for musician's, this is utterly essential if you want to produce decent vocal recordings (spoken or sung). It's lightweight, flexible and built to last. What’s more, even the most tooled-up musician will rarely begrudge having a spare to hand.
A bells and whistles controller keyboard
AffordableAssignable knobs and padsBundled software
The Akai MPK Mini MKII packs a wealth of control options into a portable package, ideal for desktop producers on-the-go. There are 25 velocity-sensitive keys, eight backlit pads and eight assignable knobs, plus it comes with SONiVOX Wobble and Hybrid 3  synths – making it a great companion if you need to quickly whip-up a backing track.
Something else in mind? These are the best MIDI keyboards you can buy
The best kept secret in studio recording
Great sound qualityRugged buildRecording pros love them
Headphones are big business now. It seems we’ll happily drop hundreds on the big, branded and Bluetooth, yet the chances are that those making the music you listen to on them did so wearing Sony’s MDR-7506s. They sound superb, are built to take a beating and they have a cool curly cable…
Explore more options in our guide to the best headphones for music making
An affordable way to add samples to your playing
Loads samples or use built-in libraryFaithful sample soundTune sounds and add reverb
The SamplePad 4 is a great gift for drummers looking to expand their setup, or any performer that wants any easy way to add percussive sounds, trigger samples or use backing tracks in their performances. There are 25 useful sounds preloaded, but an SD card slot allows you to load your own, massively expanding its utility.
E-drums more their bag? These are the best electronic drum sets around
Keeps guitars safe and rooms tidy
AGS (Auto Grip System) secures instrumentsWall-mountedFoam rubber prevents scratches
This handy wall mount will help the guitarist or bassist in your life to stow their instrument safely and securely, without sacrificing floor space. The clever AGS system closes over as you place the guitar on the hanger, meaning it can't fall forward, even if knocked. And when you're ready to play, just grab it and away you go.
Great guitar accessories and gear essentials for beginners
One of the best gifts for musicians out there
Good screen and processorVery lightCheaper than the iPad Pro
This lightweight Apple tablet hits a real sweet spot, offering a great balance between price and performance. Plus, it doesn't matter what kind of musician you are, the iPad is a great tool for everything from writing setlists and noting down lyric ideas, to recording guitar, laying down beats and editing your next vlog. In terms of spec, the 10.5-inch Retina display features Apple’s True Tone technology and an antireflective coating, while the dramatically named A12 Bionic processor should give you plenty of grunt, whatever you're using it for.

A micro classic guitar effects pedal
Almost every guitarist can find use for a Tube ScreamerEasy to fit on any pedalboardTrue bypass switching
The Tube Screamer is one of the most iconic and enduring guitar effects pedals ever produced. The TS Mini packs that tone into a tiny package at a friendly price point. Most players using an amp will happily find a home for a Tube Screamer.
The thing everyone owns but pretends not to
Tele-style headstockAffordableEasy to play
We’ll level with you, owning a ukulele in 2019 is unlikely to land you a gig. However, they remain a highly satisfying and inspiring little addition to the 'cupboard of cables and random noise-makers’ that every self-respecting musician keeps. The tiny frets can also aid technique development, as a guitar neck feels positively luxurious in comparison.

Eye-catching cable that won’t get lost at gigs
Neon designLifetime warrantyDurable build
How excited does anyone get about cables, you ask? Well, ‘surprisingly so’, is the answer when you’re talking about musicians. We love these 1/4” instrument cables from Ernie Ball. They won’t tangle, are really sturdily constructed and they come in both straight or angled options. They look great, too, with 12 eye-catching colour options.

Know a guitarist who travels a lot? Here’s a guitar that can go with them
Full size neck and scale-lengthSolid wood buildIncludes gig bag
Yeah, this guitar’s build has - quite literally - gone pear-shaped. However, the Washburn Rover is a fantastic option for the traveling guitar player who wants a quieter instrument, but doesn’t want to risk cramping-up on a smaller neck. Getting a mahogany back and sides and a spruce top on a guitar at this price is a real boon, too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to create a classic old-school Reese bass sound</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Though the Reese bass sound first appeared on Kevin Saunderson’s 1988 song, Just Want Another Chance, (released under the name Reese), it was Ray Keith who picked up the baton with his 1994 Renegade track, Terrorist. Played back via a sampler, the sound’s wobbling sped up and slowed down, adding urgency to the  sound. 
Here we look at how to recreate the classic bass patch with Plugin Boutique’s VirtualCZ. 
Click here to download the files you need to complete this tutorial.
Step 1: Kevin Saunderson’s iconic Reese bass was originally made with a Casio CZ synth. Let’s recreate one using Plugin Boutique’s software emulation, VirtualCZ. Create a new 117bpm project in your DAW and import Beat.wav and Melody.wav. Load an initialised VirtualCZ and trigger it with Reese.mid to get started.
Step 2: It’s easier to program in ADSR mode, so click that button first. Next, set the oscillators in Line 1 to A pulse and B square. Change the Polyphony mode from Polyphonic to Monophonic, which is a more suitable playback mode for a bass patch like this.
Step 3: Let’s shape amplitude. Up the Amp Env’s Decay to around 3.75, Sustain to about 85% and Release to 100ms. The DCW Envelope acts like a filter – bring its Decay to around 130ms, Sustain to 75% and Release to 425 ms. Bring the Depth down to 10%, but turn the Oscillator section’s DCW knob to about 40%.
Step 4: It’s a good sound, but we’re not there yet. Head over to the Pitch Envelope section and make sure Depth is cranked right up. Raise the Velocity to around 2 and then bring up the Sustain slider to about 5%. You should hear the sound’s pitch move up at the end. 
Step 5: Now for the final touches. Change the oscillator mix to Line1 + Line1’ to bring out harmonics. Turn up the Fine detune amount – we like it at about 30 (50 cents). Play with the DCW envelope’s Depth, and dial in velocity and key follow for variation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Home of the Week: Getting creative in Clarence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Buffalo native Alycia Ripley has a lot of nice things to say about the home that her mother, Maria Rizzo, has created in Clarence.
Among her mother’s many DIY projects: installing the faux-tin ceiling. Recycling an old damaged mantel and buffet and refinishing them. Crackle painting the breakfast buffet. Performing a plaster treatment on the kitchen and foyer walls before hand glazing them. Landscaping.
Rizzo, a retired nurse, said she has personalized her previous homes – but not on such a large scale.
“Everywhere I have lived I have looked at a space and been able to envision it differently without knocking down a lot of walls and doing major construction,” said Rizzo, whose other interests include architecture and Buffalo history.
Here is how Ripley – an author, actress and social media consultant (@talentedmsripley) – described the family residence for today’s Buffalo News’ “Home of the Week” online feature:
“I was born and raised in Buffalo but because of my work I have lived in New York City and Los Angeles but always love coming back to the family home I share with my mother. It is really special to me and to friends,” wrote Ripley, who graduated from Buffalo Seminary, Syracuse University and New York University.
“It would be difficult to separate the idea of my mother and me from our family home in Clarence. I’ll bet our friends would say the same. When she told me back in 2005 when I was living in Manhattan that she’d be moving from Eggertsville to a house in Clarence, I couldn’t wait to see it. It has been such a journey of personalization and memories.
“What I love most is that it was a basic shell upon her moving in and she customized it due to her self-taught design skill that brings an entire room together with scope and sale.
“She hand-crackled a breakfast cabinet and white-stained the dark wood kitchen cabinets and matching fridge surface (an incredibly challenging technique). She took a photo of our side garden, had it printed on large poster sheets which she attached to adhesive sheets of tiles and created a mural so that we could always see sunshine during the winter.
“We’ve had such fun times in the house, yard and pool – throwing theme parties for friends, such as an homage to ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘Breaking Bad’ and ‘Hot Tub Time Machine.’
“Some of my contributions are the Funko pop characters strategically placed around the house in unexpected places (i.e. John McClane from the “Die Hard” film series, Baby from “Dirty Dancing”).
“Our home has become such an important place in our lives. ... It’s more than a home to us and I’m so proud of all the work, creativity and time she has put into it to make it something special for us and all who come visit.
“It’s truly such a happy place to be. No wonder people now want her help bringing more of a personalized vision to their homes as well,” Ripley wrote.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(WSVN) - December’s full moon is often referred to as the Cold Moon. No, that doesn’t mean it’ll change colors or guarantee cold temperatures.
Some Native American tribes gave it the name because it lands around the start of the winter season.
This month’s moon will enter its full phase on Dec. 12 at 12:12 a.m. EST, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.

The deal, which is an online exclusive, comes with plenty of choices - including three types of party foods, two platters, a large pack of Pringles and up to three litres of Coke!
Burp!
The party foods - which are usually £1 each - include chicken goujons, mozzarella sticks, chicken tikka bites, duck spring rolls, mini beef pasties, vegetable spring rolls, hot and spicy prawns, an Indian snack selection, mini Belgian chocolate eclairs and filo prawns.
Platters - usually around £5 each - include a choice of a buffet platter, crispy chicken, dessert, Indian or oriental vegetable.

Desserts include mini chocolate eclairs and brownies, while crisps - usually £1.25 each - and drinks complete the selection.
We reckon the party pack would be great for a Christmas Eve party, or a lazy Boxing Day feast.

Earlier today, ED! told you that Asda has launched a toffee apple flavoured cheddar cheese, which promises to be tangy and sweet...
It's a limited edition for the festive period, and each 180g pack costs £1.75.
Asda is also selling a cranberry-infused Wensleydale cheese, and a Wensleydale and apricot cheese, too. Now where's those crackers?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Headphones Deals for Christmas 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's a great time buy some new headphones. Here, we bring you top tips and the best deals we've seen on headphones so that you're fully primed for Christmas, Boxing Day and beyond. We've found the biggest discounts on Sony, Beats, Bose and more
We'd recommend looking for a good deal on more expensive headphones, rather than buying a pair that's cheap all year round. Not only is the build quality likely to be quite poor on headphones with an RRP of £30 or less, but they'll also offer a bad audio experience that we're sure you'll want to avoid. There are still some decent cheap pairs from the likes of Sony and Philips though.
There are thousands of headphones deals out there and only more to follow when the sales seasons fully hit, so it can be tricky to know which are true bargains and which are worth buying. Here, we bring you our pick of the best ones to save you the trouble.
See the best deals we've found and check out our deals site for even more discounts on headphones and keep an eye on all the Best Christmas tech deals.

Headphones can cost anywhere from £5 to £500+ depending on your needs and budget. Whatever you’re listening to is the same but spending a bit more can drastically improve the comfort and quality of your listening experience.
Whether on-ear, in-ear or over-ear, there are some great audio bargains to be had. Though remember that headphones are discounted all year, so make sure you don’t buy just for the sake of it.
Make sure you do a bit of research and pick out what you’d like to save money on, particularly with Beats; there are so many different models that what looks like a good deal could be a lower priced item with not much money off its normal, lower RRP.
We've picked out our top ten for this article but if you want to see even more deals from various different retailers, we'd recommend checking out the following online stores:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Electric bikes are more expensive than regular bikes, but right now you can save money and avoid paying full price.
We’ve rounded up the best deals we can find, offering hundreds – if not thousands – of pounds of the usual prices.

There are lots of different types of electric bikes, including mountain, road, hybrid, folding and more. Plus, there are various places the motor can live: the front or rear wheel, or by the cranks.
More importantly is whether the motor uses a simple motion sensor or a more advanced torque sensor to decide how much power to apply. In short, it’s best to get a bike with a torque sensor – if you can afford the higher prices they command.
You'll find more buying advice in our roundup of the best electric bikes.
If you don’t like the look of any of the bike deals here, then shop around and see if you can find any deals we’ve missed.
The best places to look are
However, if you’re willing to accept a shop demo bike or one with slight cosmetic damage, there are discounts to be had from sites such as Fully Charged. 
From: HalfordsWas: £499Now: £398  (£101 off) View Deal
Even at the higher price, this is one of the cheapest electric bikes available in the UK, and this is a good discount of that. It's basic, there's no doubt of that, but if you want an electric bike on a tight budget without importing it from China, this is a good option.
From: Rutland CyclineWas: £1299Now: £749  (£550 off) View Deal
A great big 42% off the original price of this electric mountain bike makes the Focus Whistler2 a very good deal. The spec isn't what we'd call high end, and it wouldn't be great value at £1299, but at this price, you can probably live with Shimano Altus gears. 
Like Gtech's Sport bike, this one has no buttons or display on the handlebars: you simply turn it on and go.
There's a choice of small, medium and large frames, with the latter two having 29in wheels and the small one coming with 27.5in. Note that none come with pedals!
Even so, it's a lot of electric bike for the money.
From: Cycle RepublicWas: £3899Now: £2299  (£1600 off) View Deal
A high-end electric mountain bike, the Aspect e10 comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a Bosch CX system with a Purion display. Pedals aren't included with this model, but you can save an extra £150 of this price until 18 November using the code SAVE150 at the checkout.
From: HalfordsWas: £1799Now: £1619  (£180 off) View Deal
Using the Bosch Active Line crank-driven motor and torque sensor, the Felix is a well-equipped touring or commuting bike with 700c wheels. Despite the 300Wh battery, range is up to 60 miles. 
The discount isn't massive, but it's still worth having.
From: HalfordsWas: £1599Now: £1099  (£500 off) View Deal
The Ebco is a mid-range mountain bike with a large-capacity 400Wh battery that's good for 35-55 miles between charges. It comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a mid-mounted motor.
It's also good to see Tektro hydraulic disc brakes for good stopping power.
It's a fine deal at this price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best GHD Deals for Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over in the US GHD is celebrating 'Green Monday', in which it is offering up to 20% off selected gift sets. Here in the UK, or for standalone products, look to Amazon's Christmas Sale, which is now live. It's offering discounts on the original IV styler, plus GHD Gold, Max and Platinum+.
Note that if you want to personalise your GHDs you will need to buy direct. You can add up to 18 characters for an extra £10. Students will also get 10% off with Uni Days when they buy direct.
Here are the best GHD deals right now. Prices are updated daily.
The classic GHD straightening iron and suitable for all hair types, the Original IV is the most commonly discounted GHD product. These can reach a temperature of 185ºC, and feature 1in ceramic plates for fast styling. In common with all GHD styling products there is universal voltage, auto shut-off, a 2.7m cable and a two-year warranty. Note that you do not get the heat-resistant plate guard and wishbone hinge found further up the range. The retail price is £109.
Much like the Original IV, thanks to its 1in ceramic plates that can heat up to 185ºC, the more recent Gold stylers add dual-zone technology. By offering two heated zones rather than one, they can offer more consistent and faster styling. These irons are also suitable for all hair types, but arguably the best choice for frequent styling. The Gold model also looks a bit fancier and comes with a plastic plate guard for easier storage after use.
The retail price is £149. Read our full GHD Gold review.
 
Another pair of GHD straighteners, still with 1in ceramic plates and a max temp of 185ºC, but here with a unique wishbone hinge. The unique draw of the GHD Platinum+ is the smart tech inside, with a matrix of sensors hidden below the 1in ceramic plates constantly measuring temperature (250 times a second). The ultra-zone predictive tech intelligently adapts to your styling technique, adjusting the power to ensure an optimum temperature at all times for healthier hair (with 70% less breakage and double the colour protection) and faster, better results. This is single-stroke styling at its best, suitable for all hair types. You'll get a bundled plate guard and a three-year warranty.
The retail price is £189. Read our full GHD Platinum+ review.
 
Best for shorter hair, the GHD Mini has 1.5in ceramic plates and, as with the rest of the range, can heat up to 185ºC. This design has a rounded barrel that makes it easier to get up close to the root, and the Mini also comes with the protective plate guard. The retail price is £119. 
If the GHD Mini Styler is best suited to short hair, the GHD Max Styler is best suited to long hair. Aside from the 2in ceramic plates, which are the thickest in the range, it is otherwise very similar with a rounded barrel, 2.7m power cable, protective plate guard and max temp of 185ºC.
The retail price is £149, which ties it with the GHD Gold, but remember that the Gold also has dual-zone heating technology.
 
Said to be twice as fast as a regular hairdryer, the GHD Air has a place in the hearts of all GHD fans. This 2,100W hairdryer has a removable air filter, and advance ionic tech to reduce frizz and flyaways. You can adjust the heat and power, and there's a cool shot button for setting your style. The GHD Air retails at £99. Read our full GHD Air review.
 
GHD has four variations on its Curve Tong, each with ultra-zone tech that heats up to 185ºC consistently across the ceramic barrel in just 25 seconds.
Two have a metallic clamp, with the key difference between the Soft Curl Tong and Classic Curl Tong being the size of the barrel: 32mm vs 26mm, making the Classic Curl Tong more suitable for shorter styles.
Meanwhile, the Creative Curl Wand and Classic Wave Wand are differentiated by the shape of their barrel, with the oval-shaped Creative Curl Wand best for creating 'Beach Waves', and the tapered Classic Wave Wand best for 'Hollywood Waves'.
All four retail at £129, but you will find cheaper deals online.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ROADTEST: I tried 7 size 14 black swimmers from Aussie retailers. This is what I found.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I’m just an average young woman really; I’m not overly tall or short, I’m a size 14-16 with size DD cup, and I have the “you look so familiar” face.
For someone who fits comfortably in the average, I wondered how easy it would be to find a pair of black swimmers to wear on the beach this summer. Considering lots of Aussie women are around my size, it shouldn’t be that hard to find a good fit…right?
Wrong.
I decided to head to my local shopping centre and check out some of the places that stock a decent size range. One thing I don’t enjoy is having to spend hours getting dressed and undressed in tiny change rooms while sweating it out like Kramer in the sauna in that Seinfeld episode.
For the sake of my search, I stuck to trying on size 14 bathers the whole time to see how vast the difference was between stores. Behold, my findings.
My journey began at Surf, Dive N’ Ski; you’d hope a shop based on water itself would have a range of sizes to suit ALL beach bodies, but alas, they only stock up to 14.
In their Seafolly bikini my boobs were about to concave on me it was so tight. Also what is this one piece low-back trend? Do people want to see my crack? My ass is already on display as it is.
Cost: $$$
Variety: Not much for 14+
Fit: Small
Next was Bras N’ Things. I felt confident going in as I knew their swimwear would reflect their accuracy in the bra department, but why does everything have push up in it?
Their range was vast in colour and style and I like that I was approached right away by staff.
These styles were cute but I knew tan lines would be odd in the bikini set, and the one-piece wasn’t my cup of tea. Both fit well as a 14 and the change room lighting was decent.
Cost: $$.
Variety: Good for 14+
Fit: True to size
My oh Myer.
I had to approach a staff member to find the tiny swimwear section and that was my only encounter with a salesperson there.
I grabbed another Seafolly bikini which to my surprise fit really well, and I fell in love with this Piper one piece that looks like it belongs on the Amalfi Coast.
Prices were a little steep and the customer service was non-existent, so I left without a trace. P.S: Myer, please add locks to your change room doors.
Cost: $$$
Variety: Good style variety for 14+.
Fit: True.
Cotton On, just bring the Curve range in-store already.
I managed to ruffle through hundreds of bathers to find only one black pair in size XL – fit like a glove but again with the low back?
The cupping wasn’t fantastic as it felt a bit flimsy, so I tried on a strapless one-piece in L and it was too big at the top. The sizing inconsistency was surprising and annoying but sales staff were attentive.
Cost: $
Variety: mainly online for 14+
Fit: Inconsistent
Ah Target, you had the BEST change room lighting of the day but your shelves were harder to control than my hair after a night out.
I managed to scrounge through and find two bikinis, the first pair fit alright but the top was slightly tight, while the second top basically turned my boobs into what resembled a roll of cookie dough.
Cost: $$
Variety: Okay for 14+ if you have time to find it.
Fit: Small
City Chic, I was disappointed at the small range of sizes in your store compared to online.
There were only two styles in black, so I tried the XS (14) one-piece which fit well in the body but my DD boobs didn’t fill it in. The bikini wasn’t doing things for me and I didn’t want another weird tan line.
Change rooms had the worst lighting of the day as you can tell.
Cost: $$$.
Variety: Great for sizes 14+ online.
Fit: Generous.
And finally, old faithful Kmart. I wanted to end my day on a high whether I walked away with bathers or unnecessary Christmas decorations...I knew I’d be leaving in a good mood.
Much like Target, the swim area was a mess, but their range of styles, colour and sizing was vast. I had plenty to choose from in black bathers, the one-piece was the most comfortable of the day with nice coverage, while the bikini set was comfortable. A little sexy but not too revealing – exactly what I had been looking for.
Their sizing was consistent and good quality for the price.
Cost: $
Variety: Good for sizes 14+, just a little messy to navigate.
Fit: True
If you’re more of an online shopper like me, I have found brands such as Artesands and Youswim offer a lovely variety of styles and colours with a great true-to-size fit.
At the end of my shopping day, I walked away with two Kmart bikini sets for just $42, a kilo lost in sweat alone and a couple of thousand steps on my watch ticked off for the day.
I hope this series of unfortunate shopping events doubles as a guide for any women who hate retail shopping as much as I do, but need swimmers for the hotter days ahead!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kim Kardashian has shared her 'whimsical' Christmas decorations and we have many questions.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There’s nothing quite like getting your Christmas tree out of its box (or purchasing a real one), popping on some Mariah Carey and decorating your home with twinkling lights and brightly coloured baubles.
Unless you’re Kim Kardashian West, in which case a traditional green tree with tinsel would totally ruin your very, very minimalist decor (and by decor we mean… empty space).
Kim gave her Instagram followers a look at her Christmas decorations over the weekend, and the biggest question was… What are those?
“I love these. They’re so whimsical, like Whoville, but all white,” she narrated videos on her Instagram stories, while showing us these:
Sure, it could be Whoville, the colourful, festive town from Dr. Seuss' The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. If Whoville has been ravaged by bleach.
Now, naturally, Kim's interesting interpretation of 'festive' has raised a number of questions for well, everyone. Let's see...
They look like the sorts of toilet paper dresses we make a bachelorette parties.
They also could be constructed from q-tips or cotton balls, and actually... do you know what else is often made from cotton?
I see no difference.
There's no doubt North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm West will get some sweet Christmas gifts, but having seen Kim's decorations we have to wonder, where the heck do they put them?
(Side note: What would KKW Christmas wrapping paper look like?)
Besides the tampon forest, Kim and Kanye also have this - again, all white - Christmas tree. But there's a problem.
Usually, Christmas trees have just trunk or base at the bottom so there's room to fit delightfully wrapped toys and Cadbury Favourites boxes at the bottom. We... don't see one here.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kim and Kanye love beige, and white, and cream. We're not sure if those are colours or just shades, but either way Kimye are big fans.
The one or two items of furniture in their house fit this colour (or non-colour) scheme, and now so do their 'decorations' but... it's Christmas.
Just buy the coloured baubles.
The decorations look remarkably like the creepy egg sacks spiders lay which means in two to three weeks time, Kim's home looks like it will be infested.
We're hoping she doesn't share follow up videos of when that happens.
A selection of vox pop answers from around the Mamamia office:
If you still haven't got around to putting up your own decorations, maybe you can take some inspiration from the Wests.
Besides, it's probably a good money saver: All you need is toilet paper.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Commonwealth Bank Christmas Consumer Spending Study has compiled transaction data from previous Decembers to show the quietest and busiest shopping periods over the month. If you still haven't done your Christmas shopping, this graph can help you to avoid the Christmas rush. (And if you work in retail, use it to prepare for the coming storm...)
It seems Australians like to procrastinate when it comes to Christmas shopping - the busiest periods are the weekends just before the big date and the proceeding Thursdays and Saturdays.
On the whole, Sundays are the least busy shopping days of the week, so if you hate Christmas crowds, this is the best time to shop.
The graph below is from 2015, but given season shopping trends don't change, it still gives a good indication of the best and worst shopping dates. (Click the graph below to enlarge.)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Growing up, most males are never given a rundown on how or what they should do to keep their penis clean. Beyond washing it with water, is there anything else you need to be doing?
It’s a shame some people think talking about cleaning and caring for our genitals is embarrassing or taboo. We probably know more about hair care than penis care.
The penis is simply another part of our anatomy, so cleaning should be relatively straight forward.
If you’ve been circumcised, where your foreskin was removed soon after birth, your penis will look something like the one in the diagram (below, right), with the head (or glans) always exposed.
But if you have a foreskin (below left and centre), there are some extra things to think about when washing, which we’ll get to soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dan Murphy's looks to Netflix, Spotify for algorithm advice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Walking into a Dan Murphy’s is not entirely unlike browsing Netflix on a Friday night - after endlessly perusing a huge array of options, quite often you’ll just settle for a rerun of something that you know you like.
While there’s nothing wrong with sticking to what you know in the vast and nebulous realm of wine tasting terms, it leaves little wriggle room for Dan’s to upsell its customers.
Dan's, now part of Woolworths Group's spin-out to be Endeavour, knows that most Australians aren't drinking more, and they are getting fussier. So nudging customers up a price bracket is imperative.
Fashionable moderation front of mind,  Dan Murphy's recently launched a new Discovery Engine to score its 3.8 million customers against the 5000 wines it has on offer every week, recommending the top product each person hasn’t previously bought.
Andy Sutton, head of data and personalisation at Dan Murphy’s parent organisation Endeavour Drinks, said that the plonk purveyor reached out to two of the world’s streaming media giants to find out how they successfully nudge new things to users.
“Netflix doesn’t recommend you the same stuff over and over again. If you’ve watched the film, you don’t get it recommended, you get something like it,” Sutton said.
“You essentially see [recommendations] that are similar but not the same as products, films you’ve seen before, whether those are the same actors, same genre, same colours… there are multiple ways you can classifying this as being the same.”
Speaking at the Oracle Modern Cloud Day event in Sydney, Sutton volunteered the example of watermelon cider (why anyone buys it, the discerning Briton doesn’t know), as a relatively simple example.
Dan Murphy’s has tagged the pink packaging, sweet flavour, and buyer demographics so that if you buy the watermelon cider, you would receive recommendations for strawberry and lime cider or something with sweet blackberry flavours as something to try in future purchases.
However, Sutton said that Dan’s is still on the journey to developing a capability as robust as Netflix and Spotify’s, especially in regard to wines.
He brought up his mother-in-law’s wine purchasing history as an example, which included a mixture of pinot grigios and sauvignon blancs across a number of different price points - typically between $10 and $20.
“If you wanted to, you could just recommend within that quite niche set of products. So, ok, offer me a $15 bottle of sauvignon blanc, it’s fairly simple to do,” he said.
“What we’ve tried to do with recent items we’ve built in is look at what’s similar to a pinot grigio from a grape perspective, from a region perspective, from a taste perspective and brings those attributes into our model.
“Then you end up with wines no one’s ever heard of like albarino, petit chablis, gruner veltliner - wines that relate back to pinot grigio and sauvignon blanc but actually they bring a much wider range of grape varieties to customers.”
A quick search shows each of those varietals sit at the top end of his mother-in-law's typical spending range, or just above.
It also has the added benefit of “wallet stickiness,” Sutton said, as customers buy more of their alcohol from Dan’s.
While the Discovery Engine doesn’t operate in real-time (befitting of liquor it's still batched) Sutton believes it could one day be ramped up from weekly email recommendations to in-app offers that get sent to customers through the Dan Murphy’s app when they enter a shop.
Having a more nuanced understanding of customer’s tastes and spending habits could have wide-ranging benefits across the larger, vertically integrated Endeavour Drinks group which includes Cellarmasters, BWS, delivery service Jimmy Brings, and the ALH Group of 323 licensed venues and 537 retail liquor outlets.
Completing the vineyard to doorstop experience is Pinnacle Drinks, which operates a number of brands that produce alcohol exclusively for sale through Endeavour’s retail outlets.
By tapping data from Dan’s as to what trends are building - or not, in the case of bubbly - Endeavour could scale its alcohol production accordingly to meet growing demand ahead of other producers.
However, those capabilities will take time to mature in the same way it takes Netflix a while to adapt to new markets.
“We had a call last week with some guys from Netflix, and they had the same problem when they started, which was that it was very good with repeat viewers but when you go to a new country or you’ve got a brand new customer on board, it’s up to six weeks to get a view of what you should be promoting to them.
“They’ve now got that down to three days.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It can feel like the holiday toy-buying gets a little out of hand this time of year. We want to see our kids’ faces light up on Christmas morning, but we don’t want to drown in a sea of plastic to make it happen. That’s why adding a couple of STEM toys into the mix can be such a great middle ground. Kids are naturally curious little beings who like to dabble in science, technology, engineering and maths; parents like to feel as though at least some of their toys have educational value.
So I did some digging to pull together a few classic STEM toys, as well as newer arrivals that will bring out the curious learner in any child on your holiday list this year.
I see no reason not to start teaching chemistry to your baby when we’ve got a book like Organic Chemistry for Babies at our disposal to introduce “the structure of organic, carbon-containing compounds and materials.”
Of course, as they get older, a beginner’s science experiment kit is also a must-have and there are lots of variations out there. You can’t go wrong with Fat Brain’s version, the Disgusting Science Kit, which encourages both scientific learning and potty humour.
Also, crystals. Kids love to grow some crystals, and this Mega Crystal Growing Lab from National Geographic will teach kids about crystal formation and it gives them a nightlight base to display five of their favourite crystals in their bedroom when they’re all done. It’ll be the beginning of their rock collection, because childhood is not childhood without a rock collection.
Another staple for every young scientist is a microscope, and Educational Insights has a couple of good options: The GeoSafari Jr. My First Microscope for preschoolers and the GeoSafari Jr. Talking Microscope for young elementary-aged kids. (Their Kidnoculars are pretty great, too.)
You’re already teaching your baby organic chemistry, so you might as well also grab a copy of Robotics for Babies; it’s never too early to learn these concepts.
Then, by the time your kid is around four years old, it’s time to learn a little coding! You can start to introduce the basic concepts of coding with this 22-piece “Coding Critter” play set. Or, for a more classic robotic look, you might try the Code ‘n Learn Kinderbot, which is also good for ages 3 to 6.
There are coding robots for older kids, too, like the Anki Cozmo, which has an easy-to-use interface that Good Housekeeping says allows kids to “explore and build programs from basic to more advanced.” It’s recommended for kids ages 8 and older.
I have to start this section with one of my all-time favourite building toys: Magna-Tiles.
At $90 for a starter set of 37 pieces, they’re a little pricey (and there are cheaper versions of the same idea out there), but they’re incredibly sturdy. My son got his first set when he was four years old and just the other day, I came downstairs to find he had pulled them out from under the couch and was building some kind of structure to go along with other toys he was playing with. He’s nine years old now. We’ve built everything from simple ice cream cones to elaborate castles with these things, and every kid should have a set.
Runners-up for fun building toys:
For more magnetic fun, the 51-piece GeoSmart Mars Explorer vehicle set is another solid option for kids who want to practice their engineering skills. It comes with four how-to designs, but kids can also create their own.
There’s also the ABCs of Engineering book for the littlest ones. A is for Amplifier, B is for Battery, C is for Carnot Engine. This book will give your infant a solid engineering foundation.
You should, of course, start with the Bayesian Probability for Babies book. (I can’t help myself; I love these so much.)
As they reach preschool age, the Monkey Maths game comes recommended from a couple of parents in our Offspring Facebook Group as a hands-on way to introduce simple addition to young kids. I also like the Super Sorting Pie, which includes 60 counters (seven fruits in five different colours).
Maths Dice Jr. is a good option for kids around six years old—it helps them practice addition and subtraction quickly in their head (and it’s small, so it would make a great stocking stuffer). For a more mathematically advanced child, you might try Maths for Love’s Prime Climb, which utilises addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to move around the board.
For a mix of new STEM activities, you might consider a subscription-based option like KiwiCo, which sends out “crates” of science-, engineering- and art-based projects each month. You can select a membership by age—starting as young as 0-24 months old for the “panda” line and up to a variety of options for teenagers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Lazy Man's Guide To Losing Fat And Building Muscle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Like most guys of a certain vintage, I have mixed feelings about my body. Staying lean and not surrendering to the siren’s call of the dreaded 'Dadbod' is a key concern. But then so is building and maintaining enough muscle so that I can keep up with the young bucks on the soccer field or in the gym.
One of the main keys to success is your diet. You need a meal plan that's high in healthy carbs, fats and proteins. More importantly, it needs to be easy to prepare and affordable - so you'll actually stick to it.
There's no shortage of tips that deal with actual exercise on Lifehacker - instead, this guide focuses on the fuel you should be preparing to build muscle and reduce body fat.
Part anabolic diet, part ketogenic diet and part dopamine diet, this all-rounder is perfect for anyone looking to stay on the health train. It's a super-simple diet protocol that provides everything we need to train, grow, recover and sleep, with minimum disruption to our lives and, critically, not sacrificing taste or enjoyment.
Consider it a dietary form of GPP (General Physical Preparedness). With bodily GPP I want to be able to achieve a number of feats or accomplishments at any given time with no specific training.
For nutritional general preparedness, we’re:
Is it boring to eat this way? Or a chore? Not really. The healthy fats in this diet provide both satiety and sufficient hits of dopamine to keep cravings at bay. Permanently.
Can you eat this way if you have kids? Yes, absolutely. A few variations for Junior and you’re there.
Most supplements are stuffed with all kinds of chemicals that you can't pronounce. It’s a multi-billion-dollar industry that promises silver-bullets yet delivers (mostly) damp squibs.
However, as a guy in a hurry, I need fuel after workouts and to kick-start the day. Sleep is catabolic, meaning it depletes your muscles. That's not good, especially if you're on the lean side to begin with (what's known in the trade as a 'hard-gainer'.)
A sound guiding principle is to start the day with 30g of protein if you're serious about building muscle.
A brown-rice based, all-natural protein is probably a little less effective than some of the other stuff but it helps get me to my macros and I feel somewhat better about it, especially as I'm going to be drinking three of these a day.
A more elaborate 'one-pan keto-feast’' could include sausages, green vegetables, smoked salmon but that will take more time than we have to play with. The omelette is super-speedy.
Variations on this theme could be to include a bowl of porridge and stirring through some protein powder to make 'chocolate protein oats'. The only ingredients for this are milk, water, oats and your protein - in less than 7 minutes you’ll be fuelling up for the day ahead.
In terms of bang-for-your-buck and downright convenience, you can't go past this combination - the Holy Trinity of lunchtime goodness.
Try Sirena tuna, whose label reassures that it's line caught and sustainable etc. Basil oil flavour is especially tasty. Add a tin of Edgells 4 Bean Mix and 90 Second microwave brown rice.
Throw grated cheese over the top of this for more fat, and because, well, cheese makes everything taste better.
Total cost per meal: $5.35
You could roast / bake a tray of vegetables and chuck some chicken breast in the other side of the tray (covered in a little foil tent for half the cooking time (usually 30-35 mins) to stop it drying out.
The beauty of this is that once you've tossed it in the oven, you can go and workout for a bit or play with junior.
However, if you can get yourself a microwave steamer, your whole whole world will change.
Here's how.
Chop up your veg and layer it in the steamer according to how long it takes to cook. Then steam it for about 4 minutes. [Note: sweet potato can handle around 3 mins on its own before you add the greens for the remaining 4 mins. This depends on the power of your microwave so play around with it.]
This could be the end of the story. You serve up your greens with your meat (which you've pan-fried and rested under foil and out of the pan for 5 minutes - this is crucial.)
You'll probably want some seasoning with this though.
Or take things to a completely different level with only a modicum of extra effort.
Drain the veggies, blanche under cold water to stop the cooking process, throw a decent knob of butter into the meat pan and then mix the greens through the butter.
In a restaurant this would be called something like 'twice-cooked greens, keto-style,' or something equally grand, and, as with a lot of the cooking here, it depends on your approach to fats and what your nutritional objectives are.
Additional fats, especially those that have traditionally been considered unhealthy, is
But, if you still want flavour and satiety, then it's worth trying because it makes them taste delicious.
This plan works for busy guys (and gals) for a few key reasons:
Is it perfect? Nope.
Could it be made healthier? Yep, pretty easily. Sub in celery sticks dipped in almond butter for one of the snacks would be an easy tweak.
But bang-for-your-buck simplicity, economy and taste it’s right on the money.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apples do a lot of heavy lifting around the holidays. We bake them in pies, drink their fermented juice, and sip on spiced cider. Apple brandy is my favourite vehicle for this particular flavour, and when paired with Bénédictine liqueur, it makes a drink that tastes like a more alcoholic version of your favourite seasonal hard cider.
You can use a fancy apple brandy—like the French Calvados—but I prefer the more apple-forward (and sweeter) Applejack. Honey-sweetened Bénédictine brings some citrus notes, along with nutmeg, cedar, and a little sage. It’s like eating a slice of apple pie under a Christmas tree, and it is delicious. To make it, you will need:
Add everything to a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake until the shaker gets too cold to hold comfortably. Strain into a coupe glass and garnish with a strip of lemon zest.

In news that would make literally anybody but your makeup-hating cousin who only ever uses lip balm cringe: nine out of 10 beauty products (and tools) you use every day are likely contaminated with "potentially life-threatening" superbugs, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. Researchers at Aston University's School of Life and Health Sciences looked at used cosmetics across multiple categories — from lipstick to eyeliner to mascara — and found high levels of bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus in all of them. The biggest offender? The beauty sponges you use to blend in your foundation or contour.
Despite the fact that these sponges, like makeup brushes, are usually left damp with liquid or cream after use — making them particularly sexy for things like E. coli to breed — approximately 93 percent of people admitted they had never washed theirs. (For the uninitiated, these types of bacteria can lead to unwanted breakouts and skin infections, let alone a hospital visit if entered into the bloodstream, so . . . not ideal.)
Not only do these findings shed light on the need for more regulation on product packaging in the cosmetics industry — with Dr. Amreen Bashir, who led the study, adding that brands should outline clear instructions because "more needs to be done to help educate consumers and the makeup industry as a whole about the need to wash beauty blenders regularly and dry them thoroughly" — but they also prove just how important it is to hold yourself accountable for your own health.
That means putting in the time to wash your beauty sponges (there are plenty of tools ahead that make it easy) and sanitize your lipsticks and liners once a week, if not more. We can assure you: those extra few minutes are a lot less of an imposition than an unexpected trip to the ER.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I Never Liked New Year's Eve . . . Until My Family Started Celebrating With a Memory Jar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'd never been a huge fan of New Year's Eve. The expectations were always too great, and I'd always end up feeling disappointed. It wasn't until I was married and had kids that I accidentally stumbled upon the best way to spend it. As a family, we've formed our own special New Year's Eve tradition that all four of us now look forward to all year long.
When our daughters were very young, we did nothing. My husband and I barely made it to midnight ourselves; we were just too tired. We joked with our friends that the way we celebrated was to give ourselves a great night's sleep, but with two toddlers, even that was stretching the truth. But as they got older, we focused on establishing holiday traditions as a family that would make our kids want to spend the holidays with us — especially the ones that had a happy or merry attachment to them — so that they too could avoid that feeling of pressure to party in the perfect way.
One day, when I was scrolling through social media, I stumbled upon the idea of the Memory Jar, and I immediately knew I'd found our lifelong New Year's Eve tradition. What we do is this: as we experience things throughout the year, we jot down our happy memories on little pieces of paper and put them in a big mason jar labeled with that year. Periodically, we set aside time to think about the past few months — our vacations, our new friends, our work and school achievements, and so on. We sit and write down our memories. We do this a few times during the year and smile with excitement as the jar gets fuller and fuller.
On New Year's Eve, it's always bitterly cold where we live. We have dinner as a family like usual, and we bake cookies or cupcakes together. We light a fire, and we all put on the brand new pajamas we all got the week before for Christmas. Then we spread out on pillows and blankets on the floor, and while we eat the cookies or cupcakes we made, we dump out all the pieces of paper that have accumulated in the jar and read them out loud, one by one. We take turns reading them, we pause to remember, and we spend a few minutes reminiscing over each special memory.
When we've gone through the whole jar, we think about the year ahead, and then it's time for the girls to go to bed. Once they're asleep, my husband and I get back in front of the fire, play our favorite music from the year, and recall some of the more grown-up moments of the year that didn't make their way into the family-focused Memory Jar. We talk about the best parts of watching our children grow up, and when midnight strikes, I kiss my favorite person. Then we seal up the jar and get next year's jar ready to receive new memories.
There's no New Year's Eve pressure anymore. I'm in my favorite outfit (pajamas), my midnight kiss is perfect, and I happily sip tea instead of Champagne. I'm in my favorite place with my favorite people, feeling grateful for the wonderful life we've created for ourselves and our children, remembering our best memories, and best of all, making new ones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dietitians Say to Meal Prep These 3 Plant-Based Proteins on Sunday to Lose Weight All Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After enjoying your weekend chilling or being adventurous (or a little of both!), it's time to get ready for your healthy week ahead, and that means it's meal prep time! If you're not into making complete meals, registered dietitian Rachel Stahl, MS, CDN, CDE, of Rachel Stahl Nutrition says to food prep a few plant-based protein sources so you can add them to meals throughout the week.
Protein is key if you want to feel satiated at meals to prevent overeating and to help with weight-loss goals, and it also helps build muscle. If you don't have a ton of time to meal prep, these are the top three plant-based protein sources you should make.
"I recommend clients cut tofu into slices or cubes and bake," Rachel said. Store cooled baked tofu in the fridge so you can easily add a serving to salads, stir-fries, and lettuce wraps or burritos for the week.
You can even make a couple batches of tofu that are marinated with different flavors to give more variety to your meals. Prepping scrambled tofu is also a great option for busy mornings or quick dinners.
"Beans and lentils contain fiber, which helps with weight management. All are packed with protein, which aids in satiety," Rachel said. Cooking beans from scratch may take a lot more time than using canned beans, but it's cheaper and the flavor and texture is way better. You also have more variety than just your basic black beans or chickpeas.
You can presoak your beans overnight to speed up the cooking process, and then simmer them on the stove for about two hours (time depends on the type of beans and how soft you like them). You can also cook dry beans in your slow cooker.
If you don't have hours to spend cooking beans, lentils are another great protein option since they only take about 20 minutes to cook.
Add cooked beans and lentils to burritos, soups, or smoothies, mash them into overnight oats or potatoes, or use them in grain bowls tossed with rice or quinoa for an extra fiber and protein boost. If you're prepping chickpeas, you can also marinate or roast them to add to fresh salads.
Of course to save time Rachel said you can buy canned beans, just make sure to choose low-sodium beans. Drain and rinse a few varieties and keep them in the fridge so you can quickly grab them to add to meals.
Packed with hunger-satiating protein and fiber to keep you feeling full and energized, registered dietitian Leslie Langevin, MS, author of The Anti-Inflammatory Kitchen Cookbook said that having whole grains on hand to eat on their own or to add to salads, stir-fries, and soups can help you reach your weight-loss goals.
Cook up steel-cut oatmeal in your slow-cooker or Instant Pot. Or make a big batch of brown rice, quinoa, barley, millet, or farro on the stove; depending on the whole grains you choose, they can take about 20 to 45 minutes too cook.
Store cooked grains in half-cup glass containers in the fridge, or freeze them for later — we love these oatmeal freezer cups. Or if you're a fan of overnight oats, make a week's worth all at once and store them in the fridge. You can use rolled oats or try these high-protein steel-cut overnight oats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Body Shop's Cleansing Butter Has Nearly 300 5-Star Reviews and Costs Less Than $10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When you find a product good enough to repurchase three times and counting, there's only one thing to do: rave about it, which is exactly what I'm going to do when it comes to The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter ($10). I've tried many a gel, balm, and oil cleanser in my time, and this is by far my favorite cleansing balm, and best of all, it only costs $10. The balm doesn't boast a solid five-star rating for nothing, and it's been a favorite of skincare expert Caroline Hirons for six years. It delivers what it says on the tin: "Cleanses and nourishes the skin without leaving a trace of makeup."
Before delving into the details, a bit about my skin: I have a mostly dry skin type but am prone to both hormonal breakouts and blocked pores, which can lead to small pimples and the occasional big spot. I like to use oils rather than foaming cleansers, and (when possible) I try to avoid anything with alcohol or essential oils.
For my evening cleanse, I use about a quarter-size amount of The Body Shop's cleansing butter for my entire face and neck, massaging onto dry skin for about 30 seconds. I then wash this off gently using lukewarm water and a soft muslin cloth. I follow this with a second cleanse, typically with something slightly creamier, such as Kate Somerville Goat Milk Moisturizing Cleanser ($38). Once my makeup is completely removed, my skin doesn't feel dry or tight, which is a must for my skin type.
The key ingredients include ethylhexyl palmitate, an emollient that gives the product its buttery texture (OK for dry skin types but not ideal for oily skin types), followed by PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, which gives the cleanser its oily texture without leaving any greasy residue on the skin. Additionally, the product contains plenty of oils, including olive and sunflower, plus chamomile, which helps to soothe irritated skin. I find that the combination of ingredients doesn't irritate my skin at all. One thing to note is that it does contain fragrance, so if you know you're sensitive to perfumes, it might be something to patch test before introducing into your routine.
I love this cleanser because it doesn't feel greasy (most balms take a hot minute to remove and can leave a slippery feeling on the skin), it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, it doesn't clog my pores (even though I'm prone to this), and it removes all my makeup (however, I do prefer to use micellar water for the days I wear heavy eye makeup). The product also lasts a really long time — about four to five months for me because a little goes a long way. And finally — true to The Body Shop values — the packaging is totally sustainable. It comes in a medium-size tin, which is made from aluminum so it's fully recyclable (or reusable if you're in need of a handy tin).
All in all, if you're looking for a no-fuss, nonirritating cleansing balm (for dry and combination skin) to remove makeup effectively, and you don't want to spend a lot of money, The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter is a great option.

Lorena wore a seriously plunging bikini top at the beach.
Victoria’s Secret model Lorena Rae showed some serious skin in a very plunging bikini in a seriously hot new shot recently shared to Instagram. The beauty – who walked her first Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show last year – wowed her followers in the gorgeous new photo as she soaked up the sun in the Sunshine State and showcased her flawless all-over tan.
The photo showed the 25-year-old beauty as she hit the beach at Soho Beach House on the Miami coast.
Lorena stunned in her revealing electric blue bikini top that featured very thin strings that crisscrossed across her chest to hold together the piece of material which stretched around her back.
She paired the unique top with a pair of equally skimpy bottoms. Rather than opting for a matching blue pair, she instead switched things up with bottoms featuring a yellow pattern with different shapes.
The bottoms sat well below her bellybutton to flash even more skin and perfectly highlighted her flat, toned torso and mile-long legs with a high-cut design that stretched almost all the way up to her waist.
Lorena lay on her back as she did a little tanning in Florida. She was snapped relaxing on a blue and white striped towel on the beach, while the gorgeous blue ocean was just visible behind her.
The German model posed with her right hand up as she brushed her hair away from her face and looked off into the distance. She had her light brown locks straight and flowing down her back.
Lorena glowed as she enjoyed a day at the coast and rocked a pair of small gold hoop earrings in her ears and several bracelets on both wrists. She also kept an eye on the time with a rose gold watch and a light blue ribbon on her left wrist.
The beauty also kept things tropical as she sipped on a coconut during her sunny beach day. The model stuck a blue and white straw – which perfectly matched her beach towel – straight into the drupe.
The comments section of the hot bikini upload was overrun with praise from her 1.7 million followers.
One fan called her a “beach babe” with two eye heart emoji.
Another Instagram user said, “beautiful” with eye heart, fire, and kissing emoji.
Loading...
“Wowwwwwww,” a third commented.
The sizzling bikini shot has already received more than 133,000 likes.
But this certainly isn’t the first time Lorena has been spotted on social media in her swimwear.
The stunner was recently photographed alongside fellow Victoria’s Secret model Devon Windsor as the two slipped into a red bikini and a red swimsuit for a recent photo shoot to promote her swimwear line, Devon Windsor Swim.

Miranda Lambert is killing the fashion game once again in her most recent social media share. As those who follow the country superstar on Instagram know, Lambert regularly takes to her page to share photos and videos from her music career as well as her new fashion line, Idyllwind, which is exactly what she did in a post earlier today.
In the gorgeous new Instagram post, the 36-year-old can be seen standing in front of a plain, white wall. She put both of her hands behind her head in the shot, looking straight into the camera with a serious look on her face. The beauty looked nothing short of stunning, wearing her long, blond locks down and curled in addition to a gorgeous application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and matte lipstick.
The tattoo on her right wrist was visible in the shot as was the country singer’s killer figure. On top, Lambert rocked a tight fitting black v-neck that dipped low into her chest, showing off plenty of cleavage. The sleeves had fringe falling down the sleeves and she paired the look with a funky gold belt with blue stones. In the caption of the shot, she told her fans to trust their wings and fly while also telling them where they can purchase items from her line.
The post has only been live on her page for a few short hours but it’s earning her plenty of attention from her fans already with over 54,000 likes in addition to nearly 400 comments. Some of the singer’s fans commented on the photo to let Miranda know that she looks flawless while countless others dropped a line about her outfit, telling her that they are going to shop her clothing line. A few others simply commented by using emoji.
“I just bought a box full of goodies from your line! It was my Christmas present to myself!,” one follower wrote, adding a series of heart emoji to the end of the comment.

“Miranda, you are a very beautiful woman!!,” another added.
“Couldn’t love this anymore!!! You are stunning,” a third social media user chimed in.
Previously, The Inquisitr shared that the 36-year-old stunned in another sexy look, this time one that was a little more laid-back. In the photo, Lambert snapped a selfie with a furry friend by her side, wearing her long locks slicked back in a ponytail and covering up with a trucker hat. She appeared to be wearing minimal makeup in the shot but still looked stunning. That post racked up over 66,000 likes.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019

The supermodel has a long history with St. Nick.
Christie Brinkley gave Santa Claus a thrill this holiday season. One week after posing for a Thanksgiving photo with her family, the 65-year-old supermodel hammed it up with St. Nick at luxury New York City department store Bergdorf Goodman. Fans are just grateful she didn’t sit on his lap.
In new photos posted to Instagram, Christie is glowing in a cozy cable-knit sweater with a festive red and white plaid scarf draped around her neck. The modeling legend wears brown leather pants as she poses with her arm around the perfect department store Santa. A second photo shows the two giving the peace sign.
In the caption to the post, Christie joked that she and Santa have to “stop meeting like this.” And fans seemed to agree. In the comments section, Christie’s followers warned the sizzling superstar not to get too close to St. Nick for fear for his health.
One fan referenced Christie’s ex-husband Billy Joel’s 1977 hit song, “Movin’ Out” as he told the star to keep standing.
“Don’t sit on his lap, he’ll have a heart attack ack ack ack ack, you oughta know by now!” the fan joked of Santa.
“Don’t sit on his lap! It could be dangerous,” another added.
Others noted how “lucky” Santa Claus is.
“Christie I think you made Santa’s Christmas wish list. Very beautiful and breathtaking,” one fan wrote.
“It’s no wonder Santa has a smile on,” another added.

Christie’s new Christmas photo comes on the same day that she posted a throwback holiday pic that had her posing with a different Santa. In the vintage snap posted to Instagram, Christie is wearing a billowing purple gown as a decidedly creepier looking Santa holds out his goodie bag. In the caption to the post, Christie reminded fans to keep the spirit of the holiday season with them year-round.
“Wouldn’t it be great if we would carry the wonderful spirit of Christmas in our hearts the whole year long? Love and joy, peace on earth, goodwill to all! That would really jingle my bells! Seasons Greetings Winter Spring Summer and Fall my Friends!” the mom of three wrote.
Of course, fans know that Christie Brinkley has some inside connections when it comes to Santa Claus. The Sports Illustrated icon has been known to accompany the famous Christmas figure to holiday events, most notably the Annual New York Stock Exchange Christmas Tree Lighting in New York City. Christie has been photographed multiple times with Santa over the years, so it’s a pretty good bet she’s not on his “naughty” list.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chrissy Teigen Poured A Gallon Of Tea About Celebrity Life In Her Latest Twitter Q&A</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christine Diane Teigen is a godsend. She also has an uncanny sense of understanding when us common folk thirst for some tea about celebrity life.
Today, she jumped on Twitter, asking the web to tweet her questions about “being a super huge A list celebrity”. From the perks of fame to public transport and award shows, Chrissy subsequently provided a rather candid glimpse into her life as an A-lister. There’s literally hours of tweets in the Q&A, but we picked out the juicy ones (you’re so damn welcome). So please, sit back and a envision a day when you, too, will miss going to the grocery store.
First up: the tweet that started it all.
Aaaaaaand let’s dive straight into all things Tinseltown, courtesy of queen Chrissy.
From not taking public transport in 10 years, to paying for a whole other private airport terminal, Chrissy’s life sure seems otherworldly, doesn’t it? I’m also sobbing at the mental image of John making pancakes for the kids in the morning. This family can certainly do no wrong.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kim Kardashians Christmas Decorations Aren’t Impressing Anyone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kim Kardashian West is known for creating fashion and beauty trends but, somehow that has not translated into her interior design skills. Kim took to her Instagram story to show fans her new holiday decor. What she thought to be a whimsical winter wonderland turned out to be a boring beige display. The video shows Kim and Kanye’s $60 million home decorated with all white cotton wool Christmas trees. With the pretty much empty hallways and bland color scheme of the mansion, it doesnt scream holiday cheer.
Fans were quick to call them out noticing the lack of tinsel, ornaments, or color other than white.
Kim later showed more of the house showing a Christmas tree with white lights adding a little more to her decorations. But fans still cannot get over the cotton trees.
You’d think that with a $60 million mansion there would be more money for decorations but, if we know anything about Kim Kardashian its that she does what she wants no matter the controversy. According to Kim’s Instagram video posted on December 5th, she sees nothing wrong with her decorations. She says “I love these. They’re so whimsical, like Whoville, but all white.” Apparently the trees were recycled from the 2018 Kardashian Christmas party so, despite being boring at least the decorations are a bit sustainable.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you've got the kind of sweet tooth that only a chocolate carbonite-coated Han Solo, TARDIS-shaped bon bon or Poké Ball truffle can satisfy, your hour has come: A nerdy-themed cafe is opening in the heart of Queen West later this week.
Joining The Lockhart, The Sidekick, Storm Crow Manor and See-Scape in the local nerdy dining establishment pantheon, The Grand Order of Divine Sweets (also known as The GOoDS) is about to open at 1162 Queen West (at Beaconsfield) on December 12.
The business – the brainchild of Samantha Lapointe, the owner of now-shuttered bakery Cakes Cove, and Meridith Braun, a gaming industry veteran – offers a wide variety of "fandom-inspired desserts", from Hoth chocolate to Xenomorph mint eggs.
To kick things off, The GOoDS is hosting a promo called 12 Days of Geekmas, which will see a new slate of nerdy specials every day starting on opening day. December 14, meanwhile, is their grand opening event, which promises cosplay appearances, a Baby Yoda* cake, and "a chance to eat the universe". (We're listening...)
*NOTE: Character's name may not actually be Baby Yoda.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tacos on pizza in one delicious, high-protein dish? Plus, it's grain-free and keto-approved (!!!). It sounds too good to be true.
While you can get creative with the toppings on your chicken crust taco pizza (wow, that is quite literally a mouthful), each bite is sure to have a kick of that seasoned taco flavor.
Whether you make this recipe for your next holiday get-together or for a dinner to devour all on your own, you'll have a balanced, healthy meal that somehow incorporates three courses into one.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snow turns Sedona into winter wonderland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sedona, Arizona, is known for its beautiful red rocks, steep canyon walls and pine forests.
It's the perfect place to go hiking or camping for anyone looking for a nature-focused getaway.
So, it might come as a surprise to see the red rocks and trees covered in a beautiful layer of snow.
A snowstorm that blew through town transformed Sedona into a winter wonderland, as you can see in the video.
Sedona is known to reach temperatures over 100 degrees during the summer. But in the winter, temperatures fall below freezing for long enough for the snow to stick.
This is one of those videos that goes well with a cup of coffee, as the calmness of the drive through the snow generates a holiday warmth of its own.

    <h5 class="mb-1">QOTD: Hello, Winter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We don’t know about the rest of you lot, but the vast majority of us who toil at this august publication reside well within the snow belt. Starting around this time of year, shovelling, bundling up, and generally cursing at cold weather is a daily occurrence for most of the masthead.
Modern cars are virtually maintenance-free these days — save for vital fluids, of course — especially compared to the Bad Old Days when one had to gap plugs and set points in order to get to church on time. Despite this, are there any particular ways in which you prepare your car for winter?
Winter tires (four of them, please) are a must around these parts. They aren’t legally required like they are in La Belle Province, but to do without rubber bearing that three-peak mountain snowflake is only inviting disaster when the mercury falls. (Your author had a falling Mercury one time, but that was thanks to sagging springs on a Grand Marquis.)
Underneath the back seat of a 2018 GMC Sierra, for which I dole a monthly stipend to GM Financial, resides all manner of winter-ready gear from jumper cables to a blanket to energy bars. Seriously. As we knock on the door of 2020, I am 99-and-a-bunch-more-nines-percent positive I will never need any of that, but their presence stems from a childhood filled with tall snowdrifts and stalled cars and maternal warnings ringing in my ears about perishing on a Newfoundland roadside while a vicious winter storm covers my car. These days, the chance of that is minuscule; yet, I still cart around all that crap.
What do you pile on or aboard your rig — necessary or not — once the snow starts to fly?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Dubai’s Greatest Hellmann’s Burgers Episode 7</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Could we really talk about some of the best eats in Dubai without heading to one of its most famous locations?
In a very wet episode 7, we brave the rain to head to Atlantis The Palm’s brand-new beachside burger joint Beach Buns, and get our hands on some enormous burgers (as well as a couple of even more enormous freakshakes).
From the Cheese Injection burger (guess what that includes), to the veggie option of The Italian Job and its pure-mozzarella patty, we try some of the most insane burgers yet.
And you can win a meal for four at Beach Buns by guessing where we’re heading to next on our hunt for Dubai’s Greatest Hellmann’s Burger. Just comment on the below video via YouTube and let us know, and you could win.
You can watch the entire series so far now, right here (don’t forget to subscribe and click the bell so you never miss an episode).
Throughout the series Time Out Dubai’s Darragh and Reema search high and low across the city to bring you the biggest, cheesiest, juiciest burgers – both meat and vegetarian.
From one of the biggest malls in the world, to one of the smallest restaurants in Dubai, from giant cheeseburgers to entirely vegan burgers, we’re going to be picking out the very best burgers, and telling you where you can get them.
The entire series will be released on the Time Out GCC YouTube channel, and the winner will be announced in a special ninth episode, the season finale – and that’s where you come in, literally.
On Wednesday December 18, the winning restaurant will be hosting a special celebration evening, where you can get a free burger in exchange for a bottle of Hellmann’s. More details on that to come.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">#OnionPrices: Bollywood is an absolutely amazing source for memes and people never miss the opportunity to make the best of it. Stars like Alia Bhatt, Ananya Panday, Anushka Sharma, Ranveer Singh have always been a target of these funny memes but today the internet is flooded with meme on onions that you cannot miss.
Netizens gave a Bollywood twist and created some really hilarious memes out of it. From a scene from Shahid Kapoor to Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s famous dialogue from Sacred games, we came across many funny memes. While the prices of onion would make you cry, these memes will surely lighten up your day.
While the memes are hilarious, the prices of onion are increasing day by day. It is said that the price has hiked to 200 rupees. Well, this is a sad news and we hope this get resolved soon.
Apparently, due to delay in the arrival of new crops and damage in the harvested ones because of unseasonal rains, onions have witnessed a rapid rise in its price for a few months.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Creating a gift using a photograph can be one of the easiest yet most personal ways to honour someone.
Using a hand-selected frame to bring out the best in the photo can transform an image that might otherwise have languished on a person’s computer into art that can brighten up a room or provide a beautiful accent.
And if you’re not quite sure how best to display that great photo, getting advice from an expert can make the process a lot easier and more enjoyable, says Andrea Hatch, owner-operator of Cabinet of Curiosities , a framing and art supplies dealer in Stettler.
“Getting a special photo done up like this is a great gift idea,” says Hatch, a trained art conservator with years of experience making great pictures come alive through her custom and in-stock framing work. “There’s a real trend these days toward giving more personalized Christmas gifts, as opposed to mass-produced items.”
Here’s some other ways to get creative with your gift-giving:
Once you’ve settled on your purchase at Cabinet of Curiosities, you can do your part to help local charities. A series of tiny Christmas stockings, each designated for a different charitable organization in Stettler, is located near the checkout counter.
If you’ve got questions, you can also call 403-742-5170, or email artcuriosities@gmail.com.

    <h5 class="mb-1">London offers winter warmers with a festive flavour</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - Mulled wine, warm spiced cider and hot toddies have long been British staples during winter.
Whiskey expert Ross Dennis at Dewar’s Aberfeldy Distillery explains that the hot toddy comes from Scotland.
“The first mention of what we now think of as a hot toddy comes about in the 1780s. We think the name hot toddy comes from the Todian Well … an ancient water source in Edinburgh,” he says.
The traditional recipe mixes honey and hot water with a shot of whiskey, a squeeze of lemon, and a cinnamon stick and orange slice to finish.
“In the 18th century, it would have been a very common thing to mix whiskeys with other ingredients to make it more palatable. They didn’t have the same cask management that we have today,” Dennis says.
While the hot toddy remains popular, many cocktail bars now offer their own seasonal winter warmer.
Here are five examples from London’s cocktail scene, with tips for the home mixologist:
___
BAD SANTA
Rewind to a ‘70s Christmas at the kitsch seasonal pop-up ``Miracle,” transported from New York to the Henrietta hotel in Covent Garden. Surrounded by garish festive cheer, you can enjoy a ``Bad Santa’’ served in a winking Santa mug.
"It's based on rum,” bar manager Nico Brulin explains. “There's a bit of Arak, which is kind of like a variation of sugar cane. We do a date-infused oat milk and spiced vanilla syrup, and also some black chai tea. So it's like totally Christmas vibes, all the flavours you can find in one drink."
The smell of the spices, he adds, will have you ``feeling like a kid again.”
___
WASSAIL
For a more sophisticated tipple, head to Manetta, the atmospheric, art deco basement bar at the Fleming hotel in Mayfair. The hotel was established in the 19th century, and the bar became a glamorous hangout for arts and literary figures in the ‘30s.
Bar manager Pasquale Ferrillo makes an upmarket and extravagant version of wassail, a hot mulled cider drunk at Christmastime in medieval England in hopes of a good harvest the following year.
“I use cinnamon, fresh ginger, cloves. They bring some nice Christmas atmosphere and some sweetness to the cocktail,’’ says Ferrillo. ``Plus, of course, we use apple juice … and we serve it in combination with cognac.”
___
WARM WINTER BISHOP
Soho cocktail bar Swift is serving a mulled wine with a difference this season.
“We thought we'd do a bit more of a richer, more alcohol-full one with bourbon, chestnut, orange and red wine. We added a little bit of chocolate as well,’’ says senior bartender Sam Ameye.
He uses a Malbec red wine, and says bourbon enhances the flavours.
“It’s that kind of spirit that, because it has such rich, caramel, grainy flavours, works really well being heated,’’ Ameye says. Its nutty taste also goes well with the chestnut, he says.
___
SNOWPLOW ESPRESSO
Back in Covent Garden, at Sushisamba’s latest outpost, bar manager Daniele Ziaco has created this wintery espresso martini. He starts by combining vodka with a hot double espresso and a dash of sugar, adds a measure of amaretto for a nutty taste, and then adds coconut and pistachio foam.
The top is garnished with marshmallows, pistachios and coconut.
Grey Goose brand ambassador Ambre Morin says vodka’s versatility makes it ideal for modern takes on the hot cocktail. Her advice for home cocktail makers: Be creative.
“Just try to do it step by step and add things,’’ she says. ``I would take inspiration from mulled wine, for example. Play around with that, try to twist your hot coffee or your hot chocolate. And think about flavours such as, we know that chocolate and orange match. If we think about mulled wine and pear, that's great. I would play around with flavours a lot, and spices.”
___
HOT BUTTERED RUM WITH FUDGE
Finally, over in East London at the Queen of Hoxton’s rooftop bar, head bartender Chris McGovern agrees it’s all about experimentation, but adds, “I'd stick to the spices that a lot of people recognize. So, your festive spices like cinnamon, clove, star anise. But then do experiment with totally new flavours like maybe pineapple, or play around with gins like hot gin and tonics. Things that you can recognize, but then give it a festive twist.”
This winter, McGovern has created a new version of his hot buttered rum punch, adding fudge for an even creamier texture.
“Our hot buttered rum has always been a firm favourite with our customers. The spices we use — cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, peppercorns — it's automatically the beginning of the festive season,’’ he says. ``We add a bit of spiced rum, calorific amounts of butter, and it's just a real winter warmer … almost like a soothing jacket going into the festive season.”
He melts the butter and fudge in a pan with all the spices and an apple juice base, adding the rum at the end before pouring the mix into a tin mug.
McGovern’s top tip for home mixologists making hot serves is never rush it.
“You get the most flavour when you let it mull for maybe up to one hour, up to six hours,’’ he says. ``I always like to add the alcohol at the end so you get all that flavour and you don't lose anything.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: Kylie Minogue at Dubai Rugby Sevens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to the Dubai Rugby Sevens – the longest running sports event in the Middle East for very good reason – it doesn’t take much to get crowds excited. There for the rugby? You were in for a brilliant few days of short but sweet matches. Showing off a hilarious costume? Plenty of squads were there to join you.Whatever you were there for, one thing’s for sure – we were all there for Kylie, and she finished off the Friday (December 6) in grand style.“We love you Kylie!” was a fairly standard chant echoing throughout The Sevens stadium, a perfect venue with plenty of space for crowds to boogie the Kylie Minogue way. And why wouldn’t we? With big hits including Can’t Get You Out Of My Head, Get Outta My Way, and a brilliant merge between Shocked and Step Back In Time, crowds definitely had their nostalgia quota.Kylie wasn’t just stellar to listen to though, as she came out with costume changes and interacted with the crowd throughout the show, pulling off a slick performance.That, along with her array of brilliant dancers in throwback costumes that perfectly fit the 1970s theme of this year's Dubai Rugby Sevens, meant the crowd was having a ball of a time. She knows how to talk to her fans, too, getting everyone hyped for an upcoming tune or simply saying hello to a few young ‘uns in the crowd.Getting out was less smooth, with nearly 20,000 people to take home near the same time, it wasn't the fastest process, but those staying were rewarded with top tunes.As a fun event all-round, Kylie was a highlight of the whole thing. We’ll be feeling the locomotion for days to come.For plenty more gigs coming up in Dubai and beyond, click here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Junkyard Find: 1974 Toyota Corona Station Wagon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since my first car was a very beige 1969 Toyota Corona sedan and I now own a heavily customized lowrider 1969 Toyota Corona coupe, I’m always on the lookout for Coronas in junkyards. Just prior to a California trip I took a week ago, I received a Row52 notification about a 1974 Corona at an East Bay self-service yard.
Here’s what I found.
Obviously, some Bay Area fifth-generation Corona owner had been waiting for just such a parts bonanza to show up in a local U-Wrench yard, and this person yanked much of the good stuff from this RT118 wagon before I got there. I’ve done the same thing to a junkyard ’41 Plymouth, so I know the glory of such a discovery.
The engine and transmission no longer reside in this car, but it started life with an 18R-C 2.0-liter four-cylinder rated at 97 horsepower and a four- or five-speed manual gearbox. The 18R evolved into the legendary 20R and 22R of Toyota War fame.
The list price on this car was $3,129, or about $17,250 in 2019 dollars. The 1974 Ford Pinto wagon cost $2,771, but had just 86 horsepower and a more primitive interior than the semi-luxurious Corona wagon.
Corona sales in the United States started in the 1965 model year and continued through 1982, after which the all-new front-wheel-drive Camry shoved the rear-wheel-drive Corona aside in North America. I’ve photographed every Corona I have seen in wrecking yards over the past 12 years, including this ’66 sedan, this ’68 sedan, this ’70 sedan, this ’70 coupe, this ’79 sedan, this ’80 sedan, this ’81 wagon, this ’81 wagon, and this ’82 sedan. Since I hadn’t found a Corona from the middle 1970s until now, this is an especially satisfying Junkyard Find.
One of the final owners of this car plastered much of the interior with stickers (and, maybe, applied the rattle-can blue paint job over the car’s original yellow paint).
We can assume this car was not babied during its final years.
With a five-digit odometer, we can’t know how many miles this car ended up turning during its 45 years of life. The 18R engine and Coronas in general tended to hold together better than just about any car of the era (other than a diesel Mercedes-Benz), so this could be a 469,325-mile car.
Delivered right to your bedroom!

    <h5 class="mb-1">4 not so Popular Ski Runs in Bulgaria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The winter sports season is already in full swing and we are sure that many of you are eager to get into the snowy adventures.
We decided to pick some not so popular places for you to practice winter sports.
Here they are:
1. Tsigov Chark
If you are a beginner skier or snowboarder, Tsigov Chark is the place for you. The ski run is tucked away in the Rhodope mountains. Batak and Velingrad are located very close to the resort of the same name, so you can combine skiing along with a tour in the two cities and sightseeing nearby. We also recommend stopping by the Batak Dam, which is fabulous during the winter season.
2. The ski run at the Hotel Complex Zdravets complex
Less than 30km from Plovdiv there is a true ski kingdom - the ski run at the Hotel Complex Zdravets. Besides being very close to the city and in the heart of the Rhodope Mountains, the ski run also offers an opportunity for night skiing. The place is extremely convenient, so after the ride you can indulge in rest and delicious meals in the complex.
3. Kartala
The little known area Kartala is located near Blagoevgrad and is suitable for both children and adults, as well as experienced and beginners. The cable car to the ski run and the two tow-lifts allow you to spend all day on the slopes of Rila Mountain. It's definitely worth a visit if you haven't already.
4. Beklemeto
Beklemeto Ski Resort is located near the town of Troyan and is in the heart of the Balkan Mountains. The location is more than good, there are also some winter sports competitions in the surroundings. There are many places when you can to stay near the three ski runs at the resort - from small and cozy villas to hotel spas. In other words, there is something for everyone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For decades, automakers have been finding ways to make their cars greener not only in terms of emissions and economy, but also in the way they build them. Ford has come up with a new way to make parts, and they've collaborated with McDonalds to help them out.
Yes, that McDonald's. So, how does this work out?
See, McDonald's throws out millions of kilograms worth of coffee chaff (or grounds), which is the dry skin of the bean. Instead of throwing it out, McDonald's will be providing Ford with the chaffs and they will make parts out of that.
Ford will be mixing the chaffs with plastic then melt it down, mold it, then install the parts on the car. That way, Ford uses less plastic materials and, at the same time, do their part in recycling and reducing waste. Ford even claims that the coffee-plastic material is actually more durable and heat resistant than conventional plastic moldings. It's also lighter too, which helps keep the cars from ballooning to heavy curb weights.
So what parts will be infused with these coffee grounds? The American automaker says they will use these for headlight housings, select interior panels, and even some under the hood components such as the box for the air filter. Making parts out of coffee grounds also helps Ford save on power bills, as they claim it takes 25 percent less energy to make these parts as well.
While the idea of making car parts out of coffee leaves some scratching their heads, it's actually a sound idea. There's less waste being dumped around and it lessens the dependency on plastic in the automotive sector. It will be interesting what other materials automakers will use to make their cars greener to build.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sunday, December - John G O'Dwyer led the 29th annual Holly Walk in a lovely loop walk in Clogheen.
The group of 52 gathered in Clogheen before the walk started. Despite the forecast the weather was ideal as the group made their way around the forest tracks to Bay Lough.
Midway seasonal refreshments were enjoyed by the group. Thanks very much to Dan, Eoin, Donal and Tom. A most enjoyable Holly Walk finished in Allen's public house in Clogheen with people catching up and reminiscing on a most successful year of walking.
Thanks to everyone who helped make the Holly Walk such a great experience. A number of the group enjoyed a lovely meal in the Horse and Jockey hotel to finish a lovely day with Mid Tipp Hillwalkers.
This coming Sunday (December 15) A and B walks leave from opposite the fire station in Cashel at 10am. Upperchurch annual night hike takes place next Sunday 15/12/19 in Upperchurch village.
With the winter upon us and the ever-changing weather on the hills, the club recommends walkers to come prepared by bringing the correct clothing/gear for the walks on a Sunday.
The following is a minimum list of essentials to have with you on a day's hill walk: hiking boots with good grip, waterproof jacket and leggings, warm clothing, hat and gloves and spares, torch, food and water, walking poles, whistle and charged mobile phone.
A change of clothes and particularly footwear for after the walk is also strongly advised. There's a choice of walks each Sunday, so there's something to suit everyone.
The full programme of walks is now on our website at www.midtipphillwalkers.ie. For further information visit the website or facebook or call Denise Laffan at (087) 925 3049 for any query.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buk Buk Southern Hot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">1/254 Grange Road Flinders Park 5025
What started as a habitual scroll through Instagram one day turned into a web-wide deep dive into Nashville hot chicken for Kieren and Emily Mykyta, the couple behind new Flinders Park chicken joint Buk Buk. “Places like Belles Hot Chicken in Melbourne inspired us,” says Kieren. “It didn’t really feel like anyone was doing it here [in Adelaide].”
The new concept came after the Mykytas had taken a year off from work (they sold their old burger shop, 127 Days, to new owners), travelled Europe and had their second child. Originally conceived as a trailer for events (Buk Buk first emerged at this year’s Beer & BBQ Festival), with the help of business partner at the time Angus Fisher-Marks, the couple decided to return to their roots and open a brick-and-mortar when they found the Flinders Park digs.
The Mykytas haven’t been to Nashville, but it’s on their to-do list. They were interested in the rise of Southern fried chicken – and its mouth-burning sub-genre hot chicken – across the whole of the US, and particularly the sharp increase of food trucks in places such as California. The menu is compact and straight to the point: there are boneless pieces, wings and tenders, served as spicy as you want (“It gets hot,” Emily says of the heat levels, which range from the mild “Mom & Pop” to the sweat-inducing “All Money In”), and sides such as waffle fries, macaroni and cheese and slaw.
The super crunchy chicken is marinated in a buttermilk-hot sauce, put through a seasoned flour dredge, and then into the fryers. Then it’s brushed with a cayenne pepper or other spice mix, and served on a slice of white bread (“Texas Toast”, Kieran calls it) with slices of pickles on top. “That’s the quintessential Nashville hot chicken, versus other styles like [in] New Orleans,” says Kieren. “But there are similarities throughout the South. We called ours ‘Southern Hot Chicken’ so we could have a bit more versatility, but Nashville is the style we’re going for.”
The fit-out has a DIY, sentimental feel. An old church pew has been repurposed as a bench; the branding was designed by Kieren, and almost all of the framed photographs on the walls were either taken by the couple themselves or pulled from their family photo albums. Gelato is supplied by the Mykyta’s friends at Ecco Gelato.
As for the drinks, there’s Pirate Life and Balter on tap plus Little Bang tinnies and boutique wines and spirits.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Meet the ladies who kept the fashion quotient high and those who turned off the heat
 Katrina Kaif was spotted at the private airport with Salman Khan as the duo landed in the city. Vedhika Kumar was out for the promotions of her film, The Body, with Emraan Hashmi. Alia Bhatt's pictures dressed in all ethnic wear, made way to the Internet while Janhvi Kapoor was papped as she headed towards her car. 
Sunny Leone looked pleasant as she waved to the shutterbugs in the city. So, let's find out who were the stunners and bummers of the day: 
KATRINA KAIF- STUNNER- Kaif's latex pants with a loose black top is quite sexy, especially the high ponytail. 
VEDHIKA KUMAR- BUMMER- Vedhika has got the look wrong in that short frilly frock. 
SUNNY LEONE- STUNNER- Sunny keeps it casual and cool in green tee and loose denims.
ALIA BHATT- BUMMER- Alia's polka dotted green Sabyasachi suit is way too much polka dots in the eye. The jewellery is also non-flattery.
JANHVI KAPOOR- STUNNER- Janvhi rocks the short white dress.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star Screen Awards 2019: From Shahid Kapoor To Kiara Advani – Best & Worst Dressed Of The Night!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another much anticipated glamour event of the year, Star Screen Awards 2019, took place in the city yesterday. From Ananya Panday, Sara Ali Khan, to Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Shahid Kapoor, Ranveer Singh amongst others, celebs put their best fashion foot forward. But did their fashion choices really work out as they expected them to? Let’s find out.
From Sara Ali Khan’s glittery attire to Shahid Kapoor’s funky look – below are the Best and the Worst dressed of Star Screen Awards 2019:
Sara Ali Khan
No matter what she wears, her grace just makes everything look better. Sara opted for a Paule Ka black and white outfit, which had a bow at the back, leading to a long trail. She complimented the look with no makeup look, heart shaped earrings and studded stilettos. We only wish if the Simmba actress could have been a bit more experimental with her hair.
Ananya Panday
One thing we really like, is that Kiara’s been experimental with every look of her this year, and well this one has worked out really well too! The deep-neck Gauri & Nainika gown looked really well on the actress, and the hairdo just made her look more chic. A total thumbs up!
Deepika Padukone
Just when you’ll feel you’d have enough, Deepika Padukone is here to impress you with another outfit and leave you mesmerised. DP opted for a body fitted gown (without any thigh slits, thank god because clearly, we’ve had enough of that). The one-sided sleeve of the Alex Perry outfit, alongwith the long trail was perfectly complimented with her new short hair, and as always, take notes you guys!
Shahid Kapoor
Black and white, really seem to be Shahid’s colour. The actress after his recent appearance in a black and white printed suit, is back to impress you. This time decked up in a zebra print, Shahid Kapoor’s dapper attitude is what compliments his looks the best. This one just is another saga of it!
Kiara Advani
Kiara Advani’s latest fashion choices have left her massive fan base stunned lately. However, this time we’re left confused. From the floral print, to the sheer gown, with the thigh slit and the bow on one sided shoulder – there was too much in the single piece that we were left confused to what we should focus on. Honestly, we felt this wasn’t really ‘the Kiara level’.
Kartik Aaryan:
Kartik Aaryan hosted the Star Screen Awards in a deep blue blazer, and a well fitted pants of the same colour. The white shirt and striped bow, we feel, were too low for the glamour vibe. Aaryan should have adopted a little more stylish avatar, dodging the usuals.
Ranveer Singh:
Ranveer Singh has always left us in awe with his unique fashion statements. Remember the recent 80s look which clearly seemed to have taken over his ‘Satuday night fever’? That’s what we were expecting from him, rather than this usual embroidered silver suit. Clearly, the expectations from the actor are wayyyy high, blame it on him!
Ayushmann Khurrana:
We love how Ayushmann’s been trying to move ahead of the usuals and come up with something worth our while. While his complete white look at the Filmfare Glamour awards seemed to be a total trend setter, he seems to have gone a little overboard with the silver embroidery on the blazer.
Bhumi Pednekar
No offence, but we really feel Bhumi needs to change her stylist. While her recent appearances during the Pati Patni Aur Woh promotions grabbed eyeballs, the golden gown didn’t really suit her, specially the colour. Bhumi has posted another picture with a little different shade (thanks to the filters), and honestly just the change in colour seems to have made so much difference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Ford Ranger is dressed up in carbon fiber</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever since the T6 Ford Ranger made its debut back in 2011, owners have been busy tricking it out, as well as dressing it up with countless modifications. From making them into 4x4 rigs, to classy road-going machines, it goes to show how customizable the Blue Oval's pick-up truck is.
But what if you preferred to completely deck out your own Ford Ranger with a plethora of carbon fiber trim? Then why not take a look at what Motion R has available for the T6 Ranger. Based in the United Kingdom, Motion R decided to extensively use carbon fiber reinforced plastic to decorate the pick-up truck.
From the front bumper, front wings, rear quarter panels, as well as the rear bumper; Motion R decked out the Ranger with the lightweight composite. This gives the pick-up truck a cool and an unmistakable look. Further complementing the Ranger's sleek carbon fiber appearance are the LED daytime running lights on the bumper, the huge carbon fiber hood, 'Motion R' carbon fiber front grill, and the 20-inch 'OR21' concave alloy wheels.
Aside from the carbon fiber upgrade, Motion R also installed several aerodynamic upgrades. These include a front splitter, a rear bumper upgrade with an integrated diffuser, and a tailgate spoiler for good measure.
Interior photos were not provided by Motion R. However, they did mention that also put carbon fiber dashboard trim that is available in either 2x2 weave or forged carbon. There's even a flat-bottomed steering wheel with perforated leather. Finally, an optional full nappa leather interior can be specified for the Ford Ranger.
Want to have your Ford Ranger fitted with plenty of carbon fiber goodies? You better cough up GBP 39,995 or about Php 2.670 million to have it done, and that doesn't come with the full nappa leather upholstery. Expensive, yes. But is it worth it? Chime in your comments below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Over-egg-cited! Restaurant diner tries her hand at egg flipping trick - and brings the ceiling crashing down</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hilarious footage shows a woman bring down a restaurant ceiling - with an egg. 
The customer was invited to try a trick at the teppanyaki restaurant Hanahana in Newcastle, which involved flipping an egg into the chef's hat she was wearing. 
However, call centre worker Claire Logan, 30, manages to propel the egg straight into the ceiling causing a metal panel to fall down.
As part of the ceiling lands on top of the griddle, she and the chef are showered in debris and egg much to the amusement of the other diners sitting nearby.
Summer Sharp, 19, from Hartlepool, County Durham, was filming the high jinks at the Japanese restaurant where food is cooked on a hot plate in front of customers.
Ms Sharp, who works with Ms Logan, captioned her post: 'Can't cope with Claire trying to flip and egg and bringing the full ceiling down hahahahaha.'
Ms Logan can be seen preparing to toss a whole egg in the air using a spatula and, hopefully, catching it in her chef's hat.
The teppanyaki chef shows her the theatrics surrounding the trick, telling her she needs to hit her spatula off the griddle before tossing the egg up.
Ms Logan then gets counted down by other customers.
When the countdown ends, she tosses the egg up into the air using the spatula.
Unfortunately however, she tosses it too hard. This results in the egg exploding off the ceiling, sending egg everywhere and bringing down a section of the ceiling in the process.
The silver panel hits the griddle in front of the customers, thankfully avoiding everyone.
Ms Sharp and other customers are heard laughing hysterically as the video ends.
Speaking today, Ms Sharp said: 'Before the egg flip, everyone else flipped their own egg and caught it in their hats.
'Then Claire flipped hers, missed her hat completely, hit the roof and it came down. 
'After that the people who worked in Hanahana put the roof back up somehow and we all carried on eating and drinking.' 
Since posting the video, the clip has attracted four million views and over 300,000 likes. 
@griseldanegra responded: 'I laughed embarrassingly and shamefully hard at this.' 
@isthatmike03 said: 'All it took was an egg to touch that ceiling for it to fall?!! Tf was it held by?!'
@_thatgirlmary also said: 'Like how strong was that egg.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blackpool butcher helps the homeless</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thanks to generous donors like butcher Andy the Meat Man, The Blackpool Salvation Army can make this possible for the local people in need.
Andy and his team, since opening three years ago, have always helped the homeless at the centre by providing the meat for the Christmas lunches, and this year will be providing turkeys for two homeless shelters, the other being The Next Chapter soup kitchen on Lytham Road.
Matthew also explained that The Next Chapter makes their Christmas lunches on alternate days to the Salvation Army, due to it being so popular and wanting to give everyone a chance to have a meal over the holidays. Homeless people can experience some festive joy and enjoy a hot dinner on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day at the soup kitchen and at Salvation Army on Christmas Day.
The popular butchers at Unit 25 Arkwright Court, are also taking donations for the Salvation Army food bank, where anyone, customers or not can donate any tins or long-lasting food for the charity. Over the years people have donated food whilst picking up their meat with just a couple of donations last year equating to a £20-£30 food shop.
From October to December Andy, Matthew and the others advertise the need to help these food banks by displaying it in their shop and sharing it on their social media. These food banks will be used all year round to help feed the homeless.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some people just can't help wanting to keep up with the Joneses, and if you're eager to take stock of your social standing, Tatler has produced a list of the new must-have status symbols. 
The society bible noted the 2020s will do away with FOMO - the fear of missing out - and usher in JOMO - the joy of missing out. 
The upper echelons will stand out, not because of what they do, but thanks to what they don't do, such as not driving, not drinking, not going out and not working. 
According to the list, going to bed early is one of the truest symbols of wealth, because only the super rich can afford to sleep for eight hours at night. 
Other status symbols include owning several passports - including a mandatory EU one - a pug, and a Big Green Egg BBQ.  
Never carrying cash 
Sleeping 
Not wearing make-up 
Being a contributing editor to a magazine
Silver Cross prams
Speaking at economic forums
Trophy husband 
Crying
Big Green Egg BBQs
Having lots of children
Having those children be models
Being sober
Small parties
Owning your own train
Owning a marine charity  
Rewilding
Serving meat
Brooches
Owning a vineyard
Not working
Not owning a phone
Protesting
Twins
Puffer jackets
Pugs
A provisional license
An European passport
A bronze of your head
Old Master painting
Cardigans

    <h5 class="mb-1">How many friends are enough and do you want or need more?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GO mBEANNAÍ Dia daoibh and welcome to an exceptionally friendly Bluffer’s Guide to Irish.
This is the time of year when we get a little bit closer to family but also to cairde - friends.
Of course, there are many kinds of friend.
Dlúthchara is a close friend as is cara mór.
A nice phrase, if you are addressing someone you are very close to, is 
a chara na gcarad - dearest friend. 
Cara cléibh is a bosom friend and cara rúin - a confidante.
Of course, not all friendships are that close. We all have superficial friendships - with comhghleacaithe - colleagues at work or people we meet in the street or ex-classmates for example.
The Bluffer is the kind of person who always likes to make new friendships. 
Some people say “I have enough friends” but how many is enough?
How many close friendships do you have, dear reader? Is that enough.
Tá mó sháith cairde agam - I have enough friends and to be honest two to six good friends is probably all you would need, but, hey, the more the merrier.
You might only consider people taobh amuigh den teaghlach - outside the family as friends but some families are very close and members could be considered as friends in that case.
We, of course, are hurtling towards the season of cóisireacha Nollag - Christmas parties which fill some of you with orgasmic delight while put the fear of God into others.
Ní maith liom cóisireacha nuair nach bhfuil aithne agam ar dhuine ar bith - I don’t like parties where I don’t know anyone is a sentence for all you wallflowers out there.
Other people of course are dab hands at having conversations with anyone they meet. 
“Is breá liom cóisireacha ar a bhfuil cuid mhór daoine - I love parties where there are lots of people.
Work outings can be hit or miss. Sometimes, colleagues find they have nothing to talk about seachas - apart from work and the chat inevitably gets round to how awful the boss is, while others stare into their turkey and ham and the bubbles die in their prosecco.
Or worse, they manoeuvre you into a corner to tell you about their recent bout of deir - shingles or how Greta Thunberg is really the Anti-Christ or how their spouses are ar mire le héad - madly jealous and rarely let them out of the house – as they place their hand in your thigh. 
So maybe a better option is for you to organise a party in your own home – by invitation only to people who are guaranteed fantastic craic and company.
Whichever you choose, hopefully friendships will be cemented and new ones formed over this festive period and beyond. Friends aren’t just for Christmas, you  know.
The Bluffer is blessed with a small number of but close friends and family members,, others aren’t so lucky.
Real friendships rarely die so, if you have seanchairde - old friends that you haven’t seen in a while, why not give them a buzz, send them a text and ask them out for a coffee and a catch-up.
It’s always good to talk.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Finding your loved ones that perfect Christmas gift is never easy.
Do you buy them something practical or sentimental? Is it best to go funny or thoughtful?
With so much choice available festive shopping can often be a nightmare, especially if you've left it last minute.
If you're stuck for ideas this Christmas, and a pair of socks just won't cut it, then why not go for something personalised.
Find unique gifts under one roof with a huge range of new and exclusive personalisation services at intu Trafford Centre .
From bespoke KitKats to Harry Potter wands you’re bound to find something extra special and truly personal for even the trickiest of recipients.
After hunting out those special presents why not treat yourself to a Yorkshire pudding wrap or mug of hot chocolate in the centre's Alpine Village .
Alison Niven, centre director at intu Trafford Centre, said: "A personalised present instantly adds more heart to the simplest of gifts.
"So if you’re on the hunt for something with a personal touch to make your loved one smile on Christmas Day, you’ll find plenty of unique gifts at intu Trafford Centre."
Avoid unwanted presents this Christmas with these eight fantastic personalised gift ideas.
Here's one for the chocoholics in your life.
You may have heard of a personalised chocolate bar but how about a personalised KitKat?
Lovers of this classic bar can go to town designing a bespoke eight-finger KitKat bar. Choose from milk, white, dark or ruby chocolate and add a whole range of ingredients, from rose petals to salted caramel chunks.
Once you've made your selection, in-house chocolatiers will get to work creating your bespoke treat.
Alternatively, pick and mix eight individual KitKat fingers from a selection of flavours, which will then be packed into a personalised box.
Create your own eight-finger KitKat for £14.
Do you have a friend that appreciates the finer things in life?
If you know someone with a taste for champagne, gifting it in a personalised tin will be a thoughtful touch.
Veuve Clicquot champagne is a popular classic but this personalised tin makes it extra special.
Go the extra mile by personalising it with your hometown, a special city or the name of your favourite person for a gift to treasure long after the bubbles have popped.
A bottle of Veuve Clicquot with a personalised tin costs £59.
New and exclusive for 2019 Harry Potter fans will love Debenham's new personalisation service.
Everyone's favourite wizard is still as popular now as he ever was, even years after the last film was released.
With wands, money boxes, mugs, clothing, water bottles and drinking glasses, you'll find a personalised gift for any Harry Potter fan, no matter what age.
You know it's Christmas when the tins of Quality Street and Roses start hitting the shelves and they're often a staple over the festive period.
Come January you can always tell which flavours went down well with a tin of empty wrappers and stash of orange cremes or coconut eclairs.
But not only can you personalise the tin, you can also fill it with your favourite chocolates too.
Another fantastic gift for those with a sweet tooth. The tin will probably stick around much longer than the chocolates.
A personalised tin filled with your favourites will cost you £15. If you have your tin from last year, you can fill it up for £10.
A gift that will be truly unique, is there anything better than receiving a stunning piece of jewellery on Christmas Day?
Littlesmith is dedicated to helping you get your message across in the most stylish way possible.
Each piece is hand-stamped using the old-fashioned method of lettering, meaning that no two pieces of jewellery are the same.
Personalise your necklace with wording, letters and different shapes.
Forget a silly hat and a lame joke in your stocking, with this fantastic Christmas gift you'll find gin.
Choose from eight ‘perfect pairing’ cracker combinations from a variety of iconic gin brands including Edinburgh Gin and Tanqueray.
These are teamed with Fever Tree's six tonic flavours including the Clementine winter limited edition to create the perfect gin inspired gift.
Prices start from £8.
Lashing of chocolate spread on toast, it's the breakfast of dreams.
Christmas is the perfect time for a little indulgence so if starting your day with chocolate isn't acceptable at Christmas, then when is it?
With large and small jars available, personalise a delicious jar of Nutella with a name of your choice on the front.
Personalised jars are available in either 400g or 1kg and cost £4 or £7.
Gone are the days when your stocking would contain a piece of coal as now you can fill it to the brim with gifts and treats.
At Selfridges, you can even make a tailor-made stocking or gift box packed with miniature versions of their favourite beauty must-haves.
If you're buying for someone who loves to be pampered, they will love this stocking.
