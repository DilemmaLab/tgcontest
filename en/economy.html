    <h5 class="mb-1">EU approves 3.2 billion euro state aid for battery research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission approved on Monday 3.2 billion euros ($3.53 billion) of state aid from seven European Union countries for research and innovation in battery technology.
The approval is for projects in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden to support research and innovation in the common European priority area of batteries.
The 3.2 billion euro in public funding, is expected to unlock an additional 5 billion euro in private investments. The completion of the overall project is planned for 2031.
“Battery production in Europe is of strategic interest for our economy and society because of its potential in terms of clean mobility and energy, job creation, sustainability and competitiveness,” said Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President responsible for competition.
“The approved aid will ensure that this important project can go ahead without unduly distorting competition,” she said.
The Commission said the project involved “ambitious and risky” research and development across the batteries value chain, from mining and processing the raw materials, production of advanced chemical materials, the design of battery cells and modules and their integration into smart systems, to the recycling and repurposing of used batteries.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EU unveils €3bn research fund to develop batteries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The EU has approved a €3.2bn fund to promote the research and development of batteries as it targets strategic areas in which to help European companies develop new technology to keep up with global competition.
Seven EU countries — Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden — will provide funding of up to €3.2bn for the project, set to be completed by 2031. The European Commission said it expected a further €5bn in private investment.
Announcing the initiative on Monday, Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of promoting technology in Europe and the EU’s competition commissioner, said: “Battery production in Europe is of strategic interest for our economy and society because of its potential in terms of clean mobility and energy, job creation, sustainability and competitiveness.”
She added: “The approved aid will ensure that this important project can go ahead without unduly distorting competition.”
Maros Sefcovic, vice-president for interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: “Thanks to intensive efforts by seven member states, industry and the commission, Europe’s first major pan-European battery ecosystem is emerging, with lead projects in all segments of this strategic value chain.”
The plan will involve 17 direct participants, mostly industrial actors, including small and medium-sized businesses, the commission said. Representatives from the member states will monitor the project.
Peter Altmaier, Germany’s economic affairs minister, called it “a big success for Germany and Europe as a destination for investments in the auto industry”.
He added: “We want to produce the most innovative and sustainable batteries in Germany and Europe and so secure added value and jobs in Europe. That is why we are pursuing a comprehensive approach with our concept, from material to production to recycling. Now it’s up to us to get concrete projects off the ground.”

Mr Altmaier said German companies BASF, BMW, Opel, and Varta were involved in the initiative, which he called “the first success of an ambitious European industrial policy”.
Chemicals group BASF will contribute battery materials. BMW will be involved in developing the chemical composition, cell mechanism, cell designs and the production process.
Carmaker Opel will set up a joint venture with its French parent PSA and the French battery producer Saft to produce innovative battery cells in Kaiserslautern in south-west Germany.
The plan is for Germany to produce battery cells on an industrial scale by the mid-2020s at the latest.
Separately, Ms Vestager said EU regulators would review 20-year-old rules defining market power for companies to take into account advances in technology and a more globalised economy.
Speaking at the Chillin Competition Conference in Brussels, she said: “Changes like globalisation and digitisation mean that many markets work rather differently from the way they did 22 years ago.
“So the time has come to review the market definition notice. We want to be sure that the guidance it gives is accurate and up to date, and sets out a clear and consistent approach to both antitrust and merger cases across different industries, in a way that’s easily accessible,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jeff Bezos says employee activists are wrong and Silicon Valley firms should feel comfortable doing business with the US military</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos threw his weight behind the US Department of Defense on Friday, saying that unless big tech companies collaborated with the US military, "this country is in trouble."
Bezos was being interviewed at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in California, and he discussed employee movements within big tech companies to block contracts with the US military.
"One of the things that's happening inside technology companies is there are groups of employees who for example think that technology companies should not work with the Department of Defense," Bezos said.
The most notable example of this was Google's military drone contract Project Maven, which the company abandoned after intense employee backlash.
"I think it's a really important issue, and people are entitled to their opinions, but it is the job of a senior leadership team to say no," Bezos said.
"It's the senior leadership's team to say to people: 'Look, I understand these are emotional issues, that's OK and we don't have to agree on everything, but this is how we're going to do it. We are going to support the Department of Defense.' This country is important," he added.
Amazon has also had its fair share of employee outrage for its work with government agencies. Amazon employees have petitioned the company's leadership to end its relationship with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So far these efforts have been unsuccessful.
Bezos framed big tech's involvement with the military as a national security issue. "My view is if big tech is going to turn their backs on the Department of Defense, this country is in trouble. That just can't happen," Bezos said.
"We are the good guys," he added. "I really believe that. And I know it's complicated, but do you want a strong national defense or don't you? I think you do."
Amazon is protesting a decision by the Pentagon to award a $10 billion cloud contract, known as JEDI, to Microsoft. Amazon had been expected to get the contract, and court documents unsealed last week show Amazon is alleging bias against it on the part of President Donald Trump.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Swelling U.S. IPO backlog points to crowded 2020 field</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - More and more companies are putting plans for U.S. initial public offerings (IPO) on ice this year because of investor pushback against their valuations, creating a backlog that could make stock market debuts more challenging in 2020.
While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs, investor sentiment quickly soured. Shares of high-profile startups such as Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) languished in the months following their listings, culminating in office-sharing startup WeWork cancelling its IPO in September.
This has led to companies’ postponing listing plans. Some 44 companies withdrew their IPO registration in 2019 as of Dec. 3, up almost 50% on 2018 and the highest level since 2016, according to IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.
Proceeds from new U.S. listings in 2019 through to November are down 7% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv data. Last month was the third-slowest November for U.S. IPOs in the last 10 years.
Online mattress retailer Casper, clothing company Madewell, cybersecurity firm McAfee and Reynolds Consumer Products are among a growing number of companies putting plans for a U.S. stock market debut on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.
Casper, McAfee, Reynolds and J. Crew Group Inc, which owns Madewell, declined to comment.
Companies eyeing a 2020 listing will have to grapple not just with a busy runway but with potential market volatility fueled by the heated political rhetoric of the U.S. presidential election.
“Everybody is assuming a lot of unpredictability because of the elections next year, so there is likely to be a much bigger chilling effect than anything that has happened with companies until this point with valuations or performance,” said Kenneth Guernsey, a capital markets partner at law firm Cooley LLP.
A stock market rally that has pushed corporate valuations to historic highs should have supported many of these IPOs this year. However, the shares of many newly listed companies, which in many cases have yet to turn a profit, traded poorly, causing investors to fret that they overpaid in their IPOs.
“It’s very hard for normal investors to determine the actual value of these companies, because most of them don’t go public with profits,” said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.
To be sure, some companies have indicated a willingness to press on with IPO plans, despite the challenging conditions, with the likes of payments platform Bill.com Holdings and XP Inc, Brazil’s largest digital broker, slated to complete public listings in New York next week.
But in the absence of easy access to public markets, some companies are debating whether to go back to private market investors for fresh funding, given that many venture capital and private equity investors are searching for deals.
“The private market is currently flushed with trillions of dollars of dry powder to continue funding private companies,” said Rashaun Williams, general partner of the All-Star Fund at Manhattan Venture Partners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tighter climate policies could erase $2.3 trillion in companies value: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Tighter government climate regulations by 2025 could wipe up to $2.3 trillion off the value of companies in industries ranging from fossil fuel producers to agriculture and car makers, an investor group warned in a report.
Rules aimed at lowering carbon emissions are expected to accelerate in the coming years as countries scramble to meet obligations under the 2015 Paris climate agreement limiting global warming.
Any abrupt policy shifts risk severely disrupting current investment strategies, U.N.-backed Principles of Responsible Investing (PRI), a group representing investors with $86 trillion of assets under management, said in a report.
“As the realities of climate change catch up, social pressure mounts, and low carbon solutions get cheaper, it’s highly improbable that governments will be allowed to let the world sleep-walk into greater rises in temperature without being compelled into forceful action sooner,” PRI Chief Executive Fiona Reynolds said.
“This poses huge threats for assets and for the wider system.”
Most exposed is the fossil fuel sector which could lose one third of its current value, the report said. Fossil fuels account for around two thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Coal firms could lose as much as 44% in value, while the world’s top oil and gas companies risk losing up to 31% of their current market share, according the report which forecasts oil demand peaking around 2027.
The analysis showed that broad index-based funds such as the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI.O) could lose up to 4.5% or $2.3 trillion in its value under the most extreme scenario.
The shift would nevertheless also lead to winners.
Auto makers heavily invested in electric vehicles and electric utility firms using low-carbon power could more than double their values, the report said.
The report came out as world leaders meet in Madrid for the 2019 United Nations climate change conference, known as COP25.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Subprime lender Amigo’s chief executive and chairman quit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The chief executive and chairman of Amigo, Britain’s dominant provider of guarantor loans, have resigned in the latest sign of tumult at the high-cost credit provider that once commanded a stock market valuation of more than £1bn.
James Benamor, a self-confessed former petty criminal who founded Amigo in his twenties and briefly became an on-paper billionaire after its initial public offering, reasserted control of the business.
Chief executive Hamish Paton announced his resignation on Monday, less than two weeks after he declared the company was making good progress in its turnround efforts. Chairman Stephan Wilcke will also step down ahead of the company’s next annual meeting, and Clare Salmon — chair of the remuneration committee — will leave “at the first suitable opportunity”.
One person close to the company said the resignations followed a disagreement about strategy.
John Cronin, analyst at Goodbody, said: “The chair and CEO shared a view on Amigo’s strategic direction and there seems to be some disagreement with the founder.”
He added that Mr Benamor was “clearly unhappy with the share price performance in recent months and feels he needs to take more control”.
Amigo’s shares have lost about three-quarters of their value since the company went public in June 2018, but rose 13 per cent on Monday to 68.2p. The company’s market capitalisation has fallen from £1.3bn at its IPO to £325m.
Amigo and Richmond Group, Mr Benamor’s investment vehicle, declined to comment.
Mr Benamor, who owns 61 per cent of Amigo, quit the board shortly after the IPO, but will rejoin as a non-executive director immediately, subject to the completion of legal formalities. Kelly Black, an executive at Mr Benamor’s investment vehicle Richmond Group, will also join Amigo as a non-executive director.
Amigo lends to borrowers with bad credit histories if they have a friend or family member who can step in if they fail to repay. It controls the vast majority of the guarantor lending market and has grown rapidly in recent years due in part to a clampdown on alternatives such as payday loans. However, the FCA has questioned whether guarantors fully understand the risks they take on, whether the lender’s 49.9 per cent interest rates are too high, and whether it traps customers into persistent debt.
Mr Paton said shortly after he became chief executive that the company would overhaul its model to reduce its reliance on repeat borrowers and tighten its credit checking policies. The announcement, in August, caused Amigo’s share price to halve in a single day, but Mr Paton said the changes were essential to put the company on “firmer foundations”.
Amigo had also been considering further changes such as reducing interest rates for borrowers who have more creditworthy guarantors.
Speaking after the group reported its interim results last month, Mr Paton said Amigo was in a “better place in terms of clarity and business going forward”, but cautioned that “the FCA are continuing to look at a number of different areas across the alternative finance space”.
Mr Benamor’s Richmond Group declined to comment. Amigo said Mr Wilcke decided it would be “more appropriate” for the company to have a new chair, but declined to comment further on the reasons for the departures. Mr Paton declined to comment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tullow Oil, a British oil company, tanked on Monday morning after the company announced the resignation of its CEO and exploration director as well as cutting its production guidance. Tullow’s board also suspended its dividend.
As of Friday’s close, Tullow Oil was worth just under $1.2 billion (£890 million). The stock tanked 60% in the first hour of trading in London, wiping over $700 million (£534 million) from its market cap.
The oil company announced on Monday that its CEO, Paul McDade, and Angus McCoss, exploration director resigned with immediate effect, and the firm will cut production guidance for this year and 2020.
“We are taking decisive action to restore performance, reduce our cost base and deliver sustainable free cash flow,” the company said in a statement announcing the changes.
“A number of factors have been identified that have caused this reduction in production guidance,” including “significantly reduced offtake of gas by the Ghana National Gas Company,” as well as “increased water cut on some wells, and lower facility uptime,” the company said in the statement.
Dorothy Thompson will now move to the executive chair on a temporary basis among as part of other moves at the top of the company.
Thompson added that the board was disappointed with the financial performance of the company and was reviewing operations.
“A full financial and operational update will be provided at Tullow’s Full Year Results on 12 February 2020, with an update on progress to be given in the Group’s Trading Statement on 15 January 2020.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India climbed one spot to 129 among 189 countries in the 2019 human development index (HDI), according to a report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
In India, 27.1 crore people were lifted out of poverty from 2005-06 to 2015-16, UNDP India resident representative Shoko Noda said.
India was ranked 130 last year. The steady progress was due to nearly three decades of rapid development, which saw a dramatic reduction in absolute poverty, along with gains in life expectancy, education, and access to health care, she said.
As per the HDI, no other region had experienced such rapid human development progress.
South Asia was the fastest growing region witnessing 46% growth during 1990-2018, followed by East Asia and the Pacific at 43%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Payday firms offer loans @ 500%</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: They are banned in 15 states in the US, China has capped the interest they can charge and consumer groups in European countries are fighting to get them banned. But in India, payday loans are flourishing unchecked, with more than a dozen lenders having started operations in the past two years.
A payday loan is an ultra short-term borrowing meant to help the individual tide over a temporary crunch. Think of it as a personal loan for 7-30 days which has to be paid in full along with interest when you get your next salary. An estimated Rs 400 crore is disbursed by payday loan companies every month.
However, these loans are prohibitively costly, charging an interest between 1% and 1.5% per day. On an annualised basis, this works out to 365-540%. Credit cards, which charge 2-3% per month for rollover (or 24-36% per annum) appear cheap in comparison.
The upside is that payday loan companies don’t mind sullied credit histories or low credit scores. In fact, it helps them charge high rates. Payday borrowers are typically subprime customers who desperately need cash but have exhausted all other options including the credit cards.
Minimum paperwork required
Payday loans require minimum documentation and are disbursed quickly. A borrower just has to upload a few documents (Aadhaar, PAN card, latest salary slip and 3-month bank statement) and hand over a post-dated cheque of the amount payable at the end of the tenure. The post-dated cheque is the security the lender needs. If it bounces, the issuer can be prosecuted under the Negotiable Instruments Act.
According to Consumer Finance Protection Bureau of the US government, over 80% of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days. One out of two borrowers end up taking at least 10 more loans before they are debt-free. In many cases, the borrower only digs himself a bigger hole. This is why payday loans have been banned in most US states and are under the scanner in other countries. In China, the maximum interest that can be charged on payday loans is 36%.
The high interest rate is not the only cost for the borrower. There is also a processing fee that can be as high as 7% of the loan amount. If the cheque bounces or you want to extend the repayment date, you are slapped with penal charges of Rs 500-1,000.
Payday loan or advance?
Not all lenders charge a bomb. Earlysalary CEO and co-founder Akshay Mehrotra draws a distinction between his company and payday lenders. “Our objective is to help the borrower manage his cash flow by giving him a loan he can repay in three monthly instalments.”
Earlysalary gives loans of up to 50% of the salary and charges 2-2.5% per month. the company disburses loans worth ₹150 crore every month.
Some payday loan companies warn the borrowers upfront about the high interest rates. Loanwalle charges 1% per day on the loan, but discourages repeat borrowers by hiking to rate by 1 bps everytime a borrower comes back for more. “One should take these loans only for emergencies. An emergency can’t come up every month. If you take these loans repeatedly, very soon you’ll go bust,” says Abhijit Banerjee, director of Loanwalle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vistara signs codeshare agreement with Lufthansa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Vistara has entered into a codeshare pact with German airline Lufthansa, the sixth such agreement with an international airline as the domestic full service carrier seeks to expand its overseas network.
As part of the agreement, Lufthansa will add its 'LH' designator code to nearly 18 Vistara-operated flights every day covering ten Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.
The two carriers already have an interline partnership. Vistara is the second airline after Air India to have a codeshare agreement with Lufthansa.
In a release on Monday, Vistara said the two airlines are planning to soon expand scope of the agreement, enabling frequent fliers of both airlines to earn miles/ points when travelling on each other's networks and enjoy other benefits.
Codesharing allows an airline to book its passengers on its partner carriers and provide seamless travel to destinations where it has no presence. An interline arrangement refers to a pact to issue and accept tickets for flights that are operated by the partner airline.
Apart from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the codeshare agreement with Lufthansa will cover Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Goa, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Kochi and Pune.
"Sales under the codeshare agreement progressively open today on all channels and major GDS systems for flights starting December 16, 2019," the release said.
Vinod Kannan, Vistara's Chief Strategy Officer, said as a growing global carrier, one of its key goals is to offer an extended international network to customers through such strategic associations.
Vistara and Lufthansa already have an interline/ Through Check-in agreement, using which customers can seamlessly connect from Vistara-operated domestic flights in India to Lufthansa-operated flights to both of its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich and beyond.
Using the Through Check-in facility, customers get their boarding passes at the first point of departure for all the travel sectors, both domestic and international, with their baggage checked through to the final destination, as per the release.
Vistara, which began services in January 2015, now has codeshare agreements with six airlines -- Lufthansa, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, United Airlines and Japan Airlines.
It also has around 27 interline partnerships with various airlines.
Lufthansa said it has entered into a "comprehensive codeshare agreement" Vistara.
"As part of the new agreement customers benefit from 126 weekly flights connecting ten key Indian cities to the Lufthansa Group network via Delhi / Lufthansa and Vistara in final stages on enabling customers being able to earn miles flying with both airlines," the German carrier said in a release.
This would be in addition to Lufthansa's current schedule of 56 weekly international flights to and from the major Indian hubs of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.
"It is planned to subsequently add more destinations of Vistara's network under the umbrella of the codeshare agreement in 2020 and beyond," the release said.
Vistara operates over 200 flights daily connecting 34 destinations. It has a fleet of 27 Airbus 320 and 9 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. The carrier is a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines.
Lufthansa Group airlines serve 270 destinations in 105 countries on four continents, offering 11,000 weekly frequencies.

Text description provided by the architects. 111 East Grand is the first multi-story office building in North America to employ dowel laminated timber (DLT), a mass timber system relying on a friction-fit bond between softwood dimensional lumber and hardwood dowels. The 65,000-sf building occupies a high-visibility 265’ x 65’ urban site.
Retail spaces activate the street level with three floors of office space above. Spruce glulam beams and columns frame the 40’-0” x 6’-8” DLT panels that serve as floor and roof decks. The system facilitated a quick erection time and a smaller site crew, minimizing disturbance to the neighborhood during construction. A precast concrete service core buttresses the south of the building functionally and structurally.
The wood construction’s refined aesthetics enable the structure to remain exposed as an interior finish. This minimizes tenant improvement work and the potential for chemically impregnated finishes while providing visual, tactile, and olfactive stimulation to its occupants. Operable windows within each structural bay allow natural ventilation. Balconies on the west take advantage of downtown views. Natural Accoya wood soffits and columns complement the exposed wood interior. Black Zalmag panel rain screen clad the east, north, and west elevations.
St. Kilda Surf & Turf, a polished-casual dining establishment located on the ground level, anchors the building’s northwest corner. The restaurant’s north and west walls are fully glazed, expanding the dining experience out to the penumbra of the overhanging office floors above. The electrical conduit has been tamed to fit between the exposed structural wood panels. Edison bulbs suspended from multi-colored pendants round out the holistic, soft-industrial aesthetic.
Variously configured dining areas gravitate to a full-service bar sheltered under a volume of slatted wood and diaphanous steel. Preparation activity has been located front and center, showcasing artisanal performance with a comfortable informality. Adjustable illumination sets the assembly aglow, allowing the restaurant to strike different moods throughout the evening. 111 East Grand is innovative in both design and project delivery.
The core design team of architects, civil engineers, and structural engineers collaborated closely with the mass timber engineers and general contractors from the onset. This relationship enabled the project to push the boundaries and convey the unconventional appeal of a sensible material.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US raked in a record $7.2 billion in tariffs in October, new data shows</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US government collected a record amount in tariffs in October as a trade dispute between the Trump administration and China escalated, according to new data released Monday.
Revenue from import taxes jumped to $7.2 billion that month, the free-trade advocacy groups Tariffs Hurt the Heartland and The Trade Partnership said. That was the most in history and a $1 billion rise from the same time a year earlier.
President Donald Trump slapped steep duties on an additional $111 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1, hitting far more consumer products than in previous tranches. He is scheduled to further escalate tariffs this Sunday as the two sides struggle to hammer out the details of an interim trade agreement.
"Even when faced with this staggering number, it's still unclear whether the president will follow through with his threat to raise taxes yet again," said Jonathan Gold, a representative for Americans for Free Trade. "This trade war has lasted long enough and done enough damage."
While the White House has often asserted that foreign exporters pay tariffs, there's evidence that those costs largely fall on domestic business and consumers. Roughly $42 billion in additional tariffs were paid from February 2018 to October 2019, according to the data.
Trade-dependent sectors like manufacturing have been hit particularly hard by the trade dispute. The free-trade groups said that seven swing states — Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — had paid an additional $7.66 billion in import tariffs over the past year and a half.
China has retaliated against the Trump administration with tariffs of its own on American imports, particularly on politically sensitive agricultural goods. Chinese tariffs on US exports have totaled $12 billion since the start of the trade war, the free-trade groups said, and topped $1.3 billion in October.
Trump has sought to placate farmers through a more than $28 billion bailout program. The Department of Agriculture has projected that for 2019 more than a third of farm income will come from government subsidies.

Despite India’s progress, it accounts for 28 per cent of the 1.3 billion multidimensional poor, the report said. (Representational Image)
Making a marginal improvement, India climbed one spot to be placed at 129 among 189 countries in the 2019 Human Development Index (HDI) report released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on Monday. Last year, India ranked 130 in the index.
In India, 27.1 crore people were lifted out of poverty from 2005-06 to 2015-16, UNDP India representative Shoko Noda said. The steady progress was due to nearly three decades of rapid development, which had seen a dramatic reduction in absolute poverty, along with gains in life expectancy, education, and access to health care, she said.
The report further stated that India’s HDI value increased by 50 per cent, from 0.431 to 0.647 per cent, placing it above the average for countries in the medium human development group (0.634) and above the average for other south Asian countries (0.642).
The HDI is measured in three basic dimensions of human development for assessing long-term progress — a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living.
The report shows that from 1990-2018 life expectancy increased by 11.6 years and per capita income rose by 250 per cent.
Despite India’s progress, it accounts for 28 per cent of the 1.3 billion multidimensional poor, the report said. The report also noted that despite the slight progress, gender-based inequalities still persisted in the country, affecting women.
India ranks at a low 122 among 162 countries on the Gender Development Index. “For countries like India, which have shown great success in reducing absolute poverty, we hope that 2019 Human Development Report sheds light on inequalities and deprivations that go beyond income,” said Shoko Noda.
“India’s development initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (for financial inclusion) and Ayushman Bharat (for universal health care) are crucial in ensuring that we meet our promise to leave no one behind and fulfil the Prime Minister’s vision of development for all,” she further said.
The three basic dimensions of human development are measured in different ways. A long and healthy life is measured by life expectancy.
Knowledge level is measured by mean years of schooling among the adult population — which is the average number of years of schooling received in a life-time by people aged 25 years and older — and access to learning and knowledge by expected years of schooling for children of school-entry age — which is the total number of years of schooling a child of school-entry age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates stay the same throughout the child’s life.
Standard of living is measured by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita expressed in constant 2011 international dollars converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Struggling to Find the Perfect Job Candidate? How to Overcome the Vicious Circle of 'Experience Inflation'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even though STEM programs have grown increasingly popular, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there are than 700,000 unfilled IT jobs in the U.S.
Partly that's because over 60 percent of entry-level jobs require more than 3 years of experience. The resulting "experience inflation" creates a vicious circle: New college graduates need experience in order to get hired... but without getting hired, they can't get the experience necessary to qualify.
That's a problem Talent Path is working to solve.
Talent Path hires STEM grads who are struggling to land their first gig, identifies the gaps on their resumes, and connects them with technology and IT organizations so they can gain work experience.
But they don't work for free; during the "consulting" phase grads are paid a salary by Talent Path -- and naturally, since the consulting phase is in effect a really long interview, are often hired by the tech company they are working for.
The Talent Path approach is a clever solution to a widespread problem. So I spoke with Jeff Frey, the Managing Director at Talent Path, to find out more -- and to learn how you might apply a similar approach to your business.
I've worked with staffing companies before, but they always sent resumes for people they felt were "ready." The idea of helping develop a potential candidate wasn't on the table.
For higher level positions, that makes sense. But while there is a huge client demand for entry-level talent, there is also a real shortage in terms of what employers look for.
Education only goes so far: Many bright students get bounced out of the hiring process simply because they don't have experience.
So we're in the middle: We find those individuals, hire them directly, and pay their full salary and benefits. Then their job is to learn: First we take them through our training program, then place them with a client... and then we stay in their lives for at least six months while we continue to mentor them. 
Just throwing them into the pool after some lessons, and hoping they will swim, wouldn't be such a great idea.
Mentoring is crucial. We can help them navigate workplace dynamics, develop any other skills they need... 
Companies love it, if only because it's extremely low risk: If for some reason they don't fall in love with one of our folks, they can swap them out. And if they do fall in love with the person they can hire them directly.
It's very low risk with a potentially high reward.
Explain the business model.
Sometimes the people we train are coming out of school, sometimes they're career-changers or military veterans. We pay their full salary and benefits at a competitive rate, give them a laptop, provide training... basically, we go into debt. (Laughs.)
Then, when we place them with a firm, we charge the company a bill rate that is slightly more than what we pay the individual. If the client keeps that person long enough to reach the break-even point they can hire them directly. If they hire them earlier, we calculate the difference.
In short, we're a for-profit company, but we feel a lot like a non-profit. We get to help people launch their careers, and help companies find the talent they need. 
But I suppose I could bring in a consultant; then I wouldn't -- at least in theory -- have to worry about the learning curve.
Keep in mind the average consultant often makes twice as much as an employee. And if you like that person, their agreement with their consulting firm precludes you from hiring them. 
In effect, a company can bring in two of our people for the same cost, invest in their development... and then hire them if they choose. 
Clearly it works: Over 90 percent of the companies who take in an individual later ask for at least one more. Nearly every company we work with is a "repeat buyer." 
Also keep in mind many companies aren't well equipped to deal with entry-level talent, and to help them embrace the company's culture. Our job is to find the right cultural fit, the right skills, provide the right training to bridge any gaps... that's something tech and IT organizations, especially smaller ones, may not have the skills -- or the time -- to effectively do.
Which means your training has to be both core and bespoke.
True. Fortunately we have enough client feedback, we know enough about the marketplace and trends and skills required... we know the foundational skills and attributes.
But then you have to look at what a company considers its ideal candidate: Tech skills, business acumen, soft skills, and emotional intelligence. 
All of that creates a clear line of sight from who we get, to what we do, to how we place.
Is emotional intelligence a major gap?
Emotional intelligence is huge. Sometimes that means helping people adapt to the interpersonal dynamics of a particular workplace.  And sometiems that means helping people understand their own wants and needs and how to adapt to a workplace.
I literally just had someone in my office today say, "This is my first real job, and this is what it's like..." we often provide a shoulder to cry on or a little tough love. (Laughs.)
Plenty of longitudinal studies show emotional intelligence creates better outcomes for a business. So that is definitely part of our curriculum, both for the benefit of the company and the employee. 
Unfortunately, none of that gets taught in school. So we place people in different situations so they don't just learn about it... but can experience it, too.
So if I'm a company that struggles to find entry-level employees?
Find ways to bridge the gap between what candidates can currently offer and what you need. 
That's not a new problem; it's one staffing and placement agencies constantly struggle with. Sourcing may find an amazing individual... but that person may not align on the client side.  
How do you bridge the gap between your needs and employee suitability? In most cases, those gaps won't be skills-based. Determine what is missing: presentation skills, basic leadership skills, basic business acumen... and create a training plan to provide those skills.
That way you can hire great people who possess the talent you must have -- and develop the ancillary skills they also need.
In effect, that's what you already do -- so make it a part of how you run your business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NTMA to borrow less next year as repayments in focus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said on Monday it plans to raise between €10 billion and €14 billion in the bond markets next year, less than in 2019, as it focuses on repaying debt as the Government forecasts a broadly balanced budget.
The agency sold €15.4 billion of long-term bonds this year, at the lower end of its full-year target of €14 billion to €18 billion.
“The NTMA’s pre-funding strategy has given us significant flexibility entering 2020,” said Frank O’Connor, the NTMA’s director of funding and debt management. “Our opening cash balance is projected to be in excess of €15 billion, which means that despite facing redemptions totalling almost €20 billion, our funding requirement is lower than in previous years.”
The biggest single bond maturity is €10.6 billion of debt that falls through in April. A further €6.5 billion falls due in October.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, whose government faces a general election next year, said last week that he is aiming to run a budget surplus over the coming years, rising to 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) or 1.7 per cent of the underlying economy by 2022.The State finances returned to a modest surplus last year for the first time since 2007.
Bond redemptions are set to fall after 2020. “This follows our programme of extending the average maturity of Irish government bonds, which has increased to close to 10 years and is now one of the longest average maturities in Europe, ” said Mr O’Connor.
The NTMA typically starts the year as one of the first European sovereigns to come out with a benchmark, multi-billion bond sale. Market observers expect the agency to follow this pattern in early January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Benefit claimants hit out at 'patronising' £10 Christmas bonus that hasn't gone up for 40 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You'd think that everyone would love the thought of a Christmas bonus in their December pay packet.
Even benefit claimants get a little extra at this time of year.
But those receiving the annual bonus from the Department for Work and Pensions don't seem to be feeling the joy.
The DWP pays out £10 every year to those in receipt of specific benefits - find out here if you're eligible for the payment
And there are quite a few who aren't happy about it at all.
Many believe it's a paltry sum that isn't worth the effort as it hasn't kept up with inflation. One man remembers receiving the exact same amount in 1982, meaning it has not gone up for four decades.
One wrote on Twitter: "Got my £10 xmas DLA bonus 2day! Cld'nt help thinking that most wld happily give that up in exchange 4 being left in peace the rest of the yr."
Another replied, saying: "I did too. how bloody generous of them. and yes. I'd exchange it."
Paul Mcginley said: "If you have a job that pays well enough and you can cover everything you have to pay then you are extremely lucky.
"Nobody should be on a benefit level so low it barely makes a dent in what you need to just survive. Christmas bonus on my DLA was £10 on top of £185 a month."
StarlightMcKenzie commented: "I get DLA for son. Every Christmas I receive a brown envelope informing me of £10 bonus/extra. I wish they’d keep both. The effect on my stress levels of the envelope is not worth £10."
Shannon Murray wrote: "Any other DLA/PIP recipients leaping for joy with their £10 Christmas bonus? I started receiving it back in 1991. In 2019 it’s still £10, so much for inflation."
She added: "And I appreciate that for some people that £10 bonus will make a difference to their week, but it’s insane that it hasn’t risen in over 30/40 years.
Replying to Shannon, Mark Naylor said: "It would be £56.49 if it kept up with inflation. It's supposed to be a "bonus"; £56.49 would buy me a nice meal and some drinks to socialise with friends afterwards. £10 Might just buy me a pizza, medium sized, no extra toppings, when it's on promotion."
Owen Hamilton added: "Yeah I'm having a spending spree, lol!"
Mandy Altoft said: "I cranked the heating up to 25 for 3 minutes, made sure I used the whole £10!"
Andree wrote: "It must be getting to the point where it costs more than £10 to print, envelope & post the letters and to process the one-off payments."
Liz MacKenzie said: "I honestly don’t know why it’s given; feels patronising. I’d rather there were good social care services and a brilliant NHS where funds aren’t cut, cut, cut."
Rusty Shackleford chipped in: "Look on the bright side, I'm on ESA and I get diddly squat for a Christmas bonus!"
To get a Christmas Bonus you must be present or usually resident in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, any European Economic Area (EEA) country, or Switzerland during the qualifying week.
The European Economic Area consists of the EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
You must also get at least one of these benefits in the 'qualifying week - this is normally the first full week of December.
The DWP said it would not be giving a comment in response to the criticism but provided Birmingham Live with some background material.
It explained that the Christmas bonus payment was established by the Pensioners and Family Income Supplement Payments Act 1972 as a one-off payment which was repeated by the Heath government in 1973 and 1974.
It adds: "The bonus is a tax-free £10 payment made each year to claimants who receive a qualifying benefit in a qualifying week, which is the first week in December
"Qualifying benefits have an order of precedence for payment of the bonus  with the higher rated benefit attracting the payment.
"But only one payment of the bonus will be made."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Northumbrian Water-an energy mix that delivers for the planet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORTHUMBRIAN Water has set itself environmental objectives including zero avoidable waste by 2025 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027.
The company has already reduced operational emissions by 46% since 2009 and is working with the rest of the water industry to meet the sector’s own ambition for net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
Work to create a sustainable energy mix has already included a significant commitment to solar and wind energy, with hydro power being generated at reservoir sites, industry-leading “Power From Poo” operations and explorations of a move towards electric vehicles.
Earlier this year, Northumbrian Water signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Danish company Orsted in the first deal of its type in the UK. The 10-year deal builds upon an existing renewable energy supply agreement between the companies and will deliver approximately 100GWh per year of renewable electricity from the Race Bank offshore wind farm, amounting to 1TWh over the agreed term.
In real terms, this means Northumbrian Water will source 30% of its energy directly from the wind farm.
Power From Poo is the colloquial description of Advanced Anaerobic Digestion, a process carried out at the company’s two largest sewage treatment plants, in Howdon on Tyneside and at Bran Sands on Teesside. This involves treating the sludge at high temperature, and then feeding the sludge to bugs, this releases methane which can either be used used for sewage treatment or injected into the National Grid to be used by other people.
Any dry solids remaining from this process are inert and used as environmentally-friendly fertiliser for agriculture.
At the Bran Sands Regional Effluent Treatment Works, near Redcar, Northumbrian Water has also installed a 943-panel solar array as part of work to make the site entirely energy self-sufficient. The panels are part of a 20-year agreement with solar developer Lightsource, with the potential to deliver savings of £386,000 over 20 years.
The site also benefits from energy generated by a new £3 million hydro turbine at Grassholme Reservoir in Teesdale. The site, near Mickleton, isn’t Northumbrian Water’s first move into hydro power, as Kielder Reservoir in Northumberland – Northern Europe’s largest man made lake – is also home to two hydro electric generators. Built into the operational facilities at the reservoir’s dam, the turbines are capable of taking the natural energy from the water released into the North Tyne and turning it into enough power to illuminate a town the size of Hexham, which has a population of around 11,000.
In terms of achieving zero avoidable waste, Northumbrian Water’s Innovation Festival in 2018 and 2019, which took place at Newcastle Racecourse, were used as a testing ground for a wide range of activities. This included bans on single-use plastics, and lanyards made from recycled plastic bottles and which were unbranded, so they can be re-used for other events.
The company’s fourth Innovation Festival, in July 2020, will continue the development of these ideas and take the subject further than ever before.
Graham Southall, Group Commercial Director at Northumbrian Water, said: “We’re already the only UK water company to use 100% of its sewage sludge to produce green power, and we have an agreement in place to power all 1,858 of our sites with renewable electricity eliminating the equivalent of 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum.
“The hydroelectric plant at our Kielder Reservoir is the largest of its kind in England and one of a number of hydro turbines at our sites, and it’s within the power of our industry to embrace a mix of energy sources that can make a big difference to our environment. Our company and sector is in a really strong position – and has a responsibility to be flagbearers for a zero carbon future.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inheritance Tax rules could be changing. Here's 10 facts you need to know...</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">INHERITANCE Tax (IHT) dates back as far as 1694, when it was a duty on probate.
It then took a number of forms, including the Estate Duty introduced in 1894, until it was named Inheritance Tax in the Finance Act of 1986. At its highest, the marginal rate of tax was a hefty 85% of estates in excess of £750,000, with the duty being limited to 80% of the value of the estate.
Originally IHT was a tax on the wealthiest estates in the UK. However, in recent years, many people’s wealth has increased through rising house prices, while the nil rate band has been frozen since 2009, which means more and more people are seeing the value of their estates exceed the nil rate band threshold. With an upcoming election, it is important to appreciate that once more the regulations regarding IHT could be about to change.
Inheritance tax rules could be about to change – again –any carefully devised wealth succession plans may need an overhaul. Without forward thinking people can find their estates are caught in the IHT net. Independent Financial Advice can help mitigate the effect of IHT on an estate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Catalyst Pharmaceuticals: A Potential Double In 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
General Background
Founded in 2002, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX) specializes in obtaining treatments for rare diseases, many of which have no FDA-approved treatment options. Much of this article focuses on the current status of the company, with particular emphasis on the many catalysts for this upcoming year. There are also many references to important statements made by management during the November, 13, 2019 conference call. Overall, with the stock trading at $4.50-4.75 and with the company projected to become profitable this year, Catalyst is likely a great value play. Cantor Fitzgerald has a price target of $10-12 and SunTrust Banks have a price target of $11.
2019 Firdapse Launch and Financials
Firdapse (amifampridine), approved in November 2018, was Catalyst’s first FDA-approved product in the United States for adults with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). There are an estimated 3,000 people with LEMS in the US. To have a successful launch of Firdapse in 2019, Catalyst had to transition hundreds of patients from its FDA study to insurance-covered patients. According to Catalyst during its November 13, 2019 conference call, the “average co-pay across all patients in September stood at $1.66 per month,” which equates to less than $20 per year.
Catalyst earned $12 million in 1Q, $29 million in 2Q, $31 million in 3Q, and it is estimated that Q4 should be around $33 million. As such, the company will be earning over $100 million in 2019, making it a profitable company. According to an Oppenheimer analyst, Catalyst should report earnings of $1.04 per share for 2019.
At the current price of $4.50 with 103 million shares outstanding, Catalyst has a market cap of approximately $463 million. With the projected $100 million+ in earnings for 2019, it has a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 4.6. By comparison, many biotech companies have P/E ratios over 15, which means Catalyst stock price is low by comparison.
Firdapse Sales for LEMS in 2020
Some controversy arose earlier this year when the FDA approved Jacobus Pharmaceutical’s drug, Ruzurgi (amifampridine), for pediatric patients. Jacobus used Ruzurgi during its “compassionate use study” for LEMS. Compassionate use programs assist patients in obtaining investigational drugs that are not FDA-approved. The market became concerned that approval of Ruzurgi could potentially hurt Catalyst sales in the event physicians write off label prescriptions for adults, and the stock price declined sharply. Catalyst filed suit against the FDA because the company was promised orphan drug status with 7 years' exclusivity.
During the November 13, 2019, Catalyst conference call, management stated that there was a small group of patients that switched to Ruzurgi. However, virtually all of those patients had a prior relationship with Jacobus during its compassionate use study.
Despite the Ruzurgi approval, Catalyst's earnings thus far are only slightly less than what was originally forecasted for 2019. Management has publicly stated that Catalyst worked with hundreds of LEMS patients during the trials, so it developed a relationship with those patients, and the company is actively involved in the LEMS community. Catalyst has also publicly stated that it now contributes to 4 LEMS charitable foundations.
During the November 13, 2019 conference call, Catalyst stated that it did a 280-patient survey of its patients on Firdapse, and the patients gave a 4.8 out of 5 approval rating. The company also stated that 95% of its LEMS patients get insurance approval within 7-14 days. One can reasonably surmise that patients switching to Ruzurgi is not a formidable threat to Catalyst. The market’s concerns about Ruzurgi’s approval most likely was overblown. A new, in-development version of Firdapse, discussed below, may even give them less reason to worry.
Improved Version of Firdapse for LEMS
As part of Catalyst’s services to its patients on Firdapse, it has been working on an improved version. During the company's November 13, 2019 conference call, it stated: “Patients have requested a long acting version of Firdapse in order to eliminate the need to plan their daily activities around multiple doses of Firdapse. We are now actively developing this new product and will provide updates in the future when the product characteristics have been finalized. At this stage of the development program, candidate formulations are being developed and their drug release properties are being studied in order to optimize the long acting symptomatic treatment of LEMS.” Catalyst clearly has a very close relationship with its patients. More importantly, once the company completes this improved version of Firdapse, it should have an even greater advantage over Jacobus.
2020 Plan for Increasing Firdapse Sales in the US for LEMS
Again from the November 13, 2019 conference call, Catalyst is looking to expand its LEMS patient base in the US. The company is expected to hire 10 regional account managers in addition to 7-10 inside contract sales representatives. These new sales representative “will be targeting the roughly 9,000 neurology and neuromuscular healthcare providers that might be treating an adult LEMS patient that could benefit from Firdapse.” To further expedite the diagnosis of LEMS and offer Firdapse as a treatment option, Catalyst is now offering “a new free LEMS antibody testing program for patients suspected to have LEMS.” These free antibody test kits are being forward to neurologists and neuromuscular healthcare providers in the US. This business strategy should significantly increase its patient base.
2020 Plan for Global Sales of Firdapse for LEMS
CANADA - Catalyst announced during its November 13, 2019 conference call that its strategic priority is to “expand their commercial footprint globally.” The company went on to say that it has already filed its New Drug Submission (NDS) with Canada and has been granted a priority review. A priority review means its application should be reviewed within 6 months. The company also stated during its conference call that its commercial plan for Canada will be either to “partner with a Canadian firm or launch with an effective and efficient Catalyst team.” Based on the aforesaid, Catalyst may have approval to start selling Firdapse in Canada in 2Q 2020.
JAPAN - Catalyst announced during its November 13, 2019 conference call that it has “met with the Japanese regulatory authorities including the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, as well as the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency to discuss existing data and understand was additional data may be required to submit a new drug application for Firdapse in Japan.” The company went on to say that, “We've also recently applied for orphan drug designation, which if granted, would give us a nine-month priority review, 10 years of market exclusivity against generics and certain tax credits. We anticipate meeting with the PMDA in the first quarter of next year to hopefully finalize a plan to register Firdapse in Japan.” Furthermore, it stated, “we've been conducting market research there and as the second largest economy in the free world, we believe that Japan can be very strategic for us and offers a very promising opportunity to expand our global footprint.”
Additional Territories - The cinoabt also announced on May 30, 2019 that in addition to Japan, “upon the achievement of a certain milestone in Japan, Catalyst will have the option to expand the territory further to include most of Asian and Central and South America.”
Based on the aforesaid, Catalyst is aggressively looking to expand its global sales for LEMS.
CMS Phase 3 Study
On October 30, 2019, the company announced that its Phase 3 study for Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS) did not meet its primary endpoint.
Firdapse (amifampridine) has actually been used to treat CMS for many years, so, needless to say, not meeting top line results was a surprise. What is unusual about CMS is that there are many different sub-categories. Amifampridine was effective in treating some of the sub-categories but not all, so the Phase 3 study attempted to limit the sub-categories the best it could. Information on the CMS sub-categories can be found here.
During the November 13, 2019 conference call, Catalyst stated that there are over 50 different possible genetic defect categories in CMS. “This wide range of genetic defects produces a broad spectrum of clinical presentations of the disease and variations in response to therapy.” The company also went on to say that many of the CMS patients were children, so there understandably was concern among parents about being in a clinical study.
Despite the outcome, the company is continuing to review the data, and it is scheduled to meet with the FDA by the end of the year to discuss the results. Catalyst also said during the aforementioned conference call that “we remain encouraged by the response of some individual patients to treatment.” Given the lack of treatment options for CMS, the fact that some patients clearly showed therapeutic benefit, and the fact that Catalyst is holding off on releasing the data from the CMS study, there may be a chance that the FDA still approves Firdapse for particular sub-categories of CMS.
PHASE 3 results of Firdapse for MuSK-MG
Without a doubt, another big milestone for Catalyst will be the Phase 3 results of Firdapse for MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) expected to be released 1H2020. Firdapse (amifampridine) has been prescribed for MuSK-MG for many years despite no FDA studies being performed until now. Catalyst also has orphan drug exclusivity for MuSK-MG.
The phase 2 results of the study were overwhelmingly favorable. The report detailing those results stated: “A total of 20 patients were originally planned to be enrolled for this study between February 2016 and June 2017, but the recruitment was halted after 10 patients because there was a clear beneficial effect on muscle strength and fatigability due to one of the two treatments.” It further stated, “Despite the small number of patients, the trial reported significantly positive results as both the primary and secondary endpoints were met. This was particularly relevant from a clinical standpoint considering that all recruited patients were affected with bulbar symptoms. Overall, the side effects were minimal and there were no study withdrawals because of AEs.”
During the November 13, 2019 conference call, management also explained how MuSK-MG is much more similar to LEMS than CMS. Management specifically stated, “As described previously, the CMS trial had a lot of variability due to many genetic defects involved resulting in a very heterogeneous patient population and variation in response to treatment. However, MuSK-MG like LEMS is caused by a single antibody to a single protein in the neuromuscular junction resulting in a more homogeneous patient population which should exhibit consistency in response to treatment between patients, sites and across multiple trials.” Based on Catalyst’s representation and the very favorable Phase 2 data, it appears as though there is a very good chance the Phase 3 data meets its primary endpoints.
If MuSK-MG meets its primary endpoints, Catalyst will already have an established sales force in the US with additional sales territories potentially opening in Canada, Japan and others.
Proof of Concept Study for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Type 3
Catalyst is also performing a proof of concept study for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in Italy and Eastern Europe. Management stated during their November 13, 2019 conference call that it is evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of amifampridine and ambulatory patients diagnosed with SMA Type 3. These results are expected 1H 2020.
Additional Pipeline Products
Catalyst also stated during its November 13 conference call that “we have begun the process for assessing and evaluating external drug development programs that are late-stage as well as potential drug acquisitions that we believe may have a clear path to value creation through their impact on unmet medical needs for patients suffering from rare debilitating disease.” Based on that statement, the company may be further expanding its pipeline.
Is There A Potential For Stock Dilution?
A concern for many investors for small-cap stocks is whether there is a risk of stock dilution with an equity offering. According to Catalyst, during its November 13, 2019 conference call, “as we reported yesterday, we ended the third quarter with approximately $81.6 million in cash and investments and no funded debt. Our cash continues to build quarterly and near-term we see no need for a sale of our common stock. Further, we believe that if we have access to alternative forms of nondilutive financing such as a term loan from conventional bank lenders in the event that we source a promising acquisition or product opportunity.” Based on Catalyst’s representation, its current cash position, the fact that its cash position continues to build quarterly, and the company's access to financing, it is highly unlikely there will be stock dilution.
Catalyst's lawsuit with the FDA
A potential risk for investing in Catalyst is if the company loses its lawsuit against the FDA for approving Ruzurgi. A loss clearly wouldn't be to Catalyst’s benefit. However, objectively, what would the actual impact be? Ruzurgi would still only be approved for pediatric patients, so physicians would need to write off-label for adults. Patients would also still need to get approval from their insurance company for off-label approval.
As stated above, Catalyst is very active in the LEMS community and has a close relationship with its patients. Most of the company’s patients are already covered by insurance with only an average $20 co-pay. To date, only a very small amount of patients have switched to Ruzurgi, and those are primarily patients that had a prior relationship with Jacobus. Ruzurgi’s formula requires refrigeration whereas Catalyst’s does not. Most importantly, Catalyst is actively working on an improved Firdapse formula to provide an improved therapeutic benefit. It would be great for Catalyst to win the FDA lawsuit, however, even with the Ruzurgi approval, clearly most patients still prefer Firdapse.
Forecasted Sales
Catalyst provided revenue guidance of $135-$155 million for 2020 but further stated, “as we continue to gain more experience next year, we’ll look to tighten the range of forecast for 2020.” As stated above, the company should be generating over $100 million for sales of Firdapse for LEMS in 2019. Catalyst is currently generating over $30 million+ a quarter, so assuming its patient base remains the same, 2020 Firdapse sales for LEMS (without any increase or decrease in patients) should be $120 million. If the increased Firdapse sales force is successful with its distribution of the free LEMS antibody tests to neurologists, and the sales force can attract more patients, revenues should be significantly higher. If Firdapse gets approved in Canada (1H 2020), that approval could equate to another significant revenue stream in 2020. Depending on when the P3 results for MuSK-MG comes out, and assuming a successful study, the potential revenues from that product will most likely be Q4 2020. Assuming Japanese approval within the next 9 months, that revenue stream most likely would be realized in 2021. All in all, there is a lot of potential for Catalyst to significantly increase its revenue stream over the next year.
Summary of catalysts for the next 12 months
Summary
Although Catalyst did have some controversy earlier this year, it had a successful launch of Firdapse in the United States, transitioning it into a profitable company. The company is aggressively working on increasing sales for LEMS in both the United States and globally. It is working on improving its Firdapse formula at the request of its patients to maintain its high approval rating and to ensure Firdapse remains the preferred treatment for LEMS. The company is also working on expanding its pipeline and may have additional products for sale in the near future. At the current price, I believe Catalyst is a strong buy and has a price target of $10 within the next 12 months. This price target is a conservative estimate compared to Cantor Fitzgerald's price target of $10-12 and SunTrust Banks' price target of $11.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Originally published Dec. 2, 2019
Virtualization giant VMware (NYSE:VMW) recently announced a strong third quarter that beat estimates. Over the past few years, VMware has made several acquisitions that have now been integrated into its portfolio.
VMware's third-quarter revenues grew 12% over the year to $2.46 billion versus the Street estimate of $2.41 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, ahead of the Street's forecast of $1.41. Net income was $621 million or $1.5 per share compared with $334 million or $0.81 per share a year ago.
By segment, license revenues grew 10% over the year to $974 million and services segment grew 12.6% to $1.48 billion for the quarter. NSX license bookings were up 50%, vSAN license bookings are up over 35% and EUC license bookings once again increased over 20%. Hybrid Cloud and SaaS recurring revenue grew 40% over the year and accounted for over 13% of total revenues.
VMware reported a strong quarter across its product and solutions portfolio with six of its top 10 customers purchasing the VMware Cloud Foundation solution stack. This platform solution consists of the full software-defined data center (SDDC) stack and is offered on private clouds, public clouds as well as partner managed clouds.
For the fourth quarter, the company expects license revenue to grow 13% to $1.39 billion and total revenue to grow 13.8% to $2.95 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $2.92 billion. It expects non-GAAP EPS of $2.16, missing the analysts' forecast of $2.19 per share.
During the quarter, VMware completed its $2.1 billion acquisition of Carbon Black, a leader in cloud-native endpoint protection. Carbon Black will form the nucleus of VMware's security offerings, focusing on helping VMware customers with advanced cyber security protection and in-depth behavioral insights to help stop sophisticated attacks and accelerate response. VMware's Carbon Black Cloud, along with Dell Trusted Devices and Secureworks, is now the preferred endpoint security solution for Dell commercial customers.
For the full year, VMware expects total revenue to grow 12.5% to $10.1 billion, including the addition of Carbon Black's financials. It expects license revenue to grow 12% to $4.245 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $6.58.
During the quarter, VMware launched VMware Tanzu, a new Kubernetes portfolio of products and services focused on Kubernetes. VMware Tanzu Mission Control is a single point of control from which customers will manage all their Kubernetes clusters regardless of where they run. It also includes Project Pacific, which is a technology preview focused on transforming VMware vSphere into a Kubernetes-native platform in a future release. Tanzu is built with Kubernetes technologies from its recent acquisition of Pivotal for $2.7 billion and Heptio for $550 million.
VMware continued to execute against its multi-cloud strategy as it expanded its cloud partnerships. VMware Cloud on AWS is now available in the AWS EU (Stockholm) region, bringing the total number of available global regions in Europe to five, and globally to 17 in just over two years.
VMware announced the continuation of its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with many new technology initiatives. This includes introduction of VMware Workspace ONE for Microsoft Endpoint Manager to enable modern management for Windows 10 and Azure VMware Solutions, the addition of new cloud migration capabilities with VMware HCX and the ability to extend Azure to the branch and edge with VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud. VeloCloud was acquired in December 2017 for $449 million.
VMware's Carbon Black Cloud, along with Dell Trusted Devices and Secureworks, is now the preferred endpoint security solution for Dell commercial customers.
With the help of the recent acquisitions, VMware is building up its cloud, containers, and security portfolio to sustain its double-digit growth. Its stock is trading at $155.62 with a market capitalization of $63.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $206.80 in May this year and a 52-week low of $128.69 in August this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Our return from Thanksgiving break was certainly an interesting one. Right off the bat, we saw an almost 850-point drop in the Dow Jones from Black Friday until Tuesday as President Trump was quoted as saying that he saw the chances of a trade deal lessening. Markets were bailed out by a 4am anonymously sourced report that trade discussions were back on. You can't say that this market isn't interesting.
The tariff deadline is set for a week from today - December 15th. We expect it to pass without any grand gestures. The key to this game seems to be delay, tweet and delay some more. The Chinese are not inclined to make a deal. The Chinese government thinks in terms of decades and centuries - not the next news cycle and tomorrow's stock market open. As far as the Chinese are concerned, they have the view that Trump may be out in a year, so why should they help him by making a deal.
The Chinese do need to keep talks alive as they require more pork than they can get their hands on as a vicious swine fever has culled their herds. China produces half of the world's pork supply and pork is the most consumed meat in the country. Back in the 1990s when obtaining our Political Science degree, it was common knowledge that the most feared situation in the Chinese Communist party was unrest and rebellion among its immense population. The most dangerous event would be if something happened to their pig herds and the availability of pork. Empty bellies lead to rebellion. Alfred Henry Lewis, the American novelist, once said that only 9 meals separate mankind and anarchy.
The Chinese will delay and Trump will bellow. The jobs report on Friday bought Trump more time and has given him more leverage over the Chinese. The jobs report should also put the Fed at ease concerning the trade war and the economy. The Fed will, however, keep plying the market with QE4 until the second quarter of 2020. We would warn you that we would expect that an announcement of a Phase Trade One deal would negatively impact the market. Buy on the rumor(s) and sell on the news.
There was a chart making the rounds this week in reference to the Fed balance sheet and stock market performance. The chart implies, and we agree, that, as goes the balance sheet so goes the market. In the past nine weeks, the Fed's balance sheet has grown in eight of them. Of those nine weeks, only one week saw a lower stock market. I will let you guess which week was lower.
Equity valuations keep soaring and are now in the top 10% of all time rivaling the Dot Com Era of 2000-2001. That era also had the Fed stuffing money into the system ahead of Y2K which led to the expansion and bursting of the Dot Com Bubble. Why our obsession with valuations? From valuations, we can extrapolate future returns. Higher valuations imply lower future returns. Central bankers continue to push rates lower and pour money into the system pressing asset prices higher. Check out the following chart from Zero Hedge.
In the past 5 years, the S&P 500 stock index has risen over 50% and during that period operating profits for non-financial companies have declined over 15%, a drop that has always been associated with economic recessions.
Source: Bloomberg
The Fed is pushing money into the system at a rate equal to QE1 when there was a crisis at hand. Central bankers are planning on keeping the money spigot open in 2020. It should continue to push asset prices higher as long as investors don't lose confidence in the Fed. The music is playing. Dance closer to the door.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Golden Ocean Group: Very Strong Results Despite The Trade War</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
On Thursday, November 21, 2019, dry bulk shipping giant Golden Ocean Group Limited (GOGL) announced its third-quarter 2019 earnings results. At first glance, these earnings were mixed as the company beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of top-line revenues, although it did fail to meet their earnings expectations. With that said though, the earnings miss was not an especially large one. A closer look at the actual earnings report though shows something of a different story as the company showed considerable improvement compared to the second quarter as well as took some steps that will likely help to stimulate its forward growth.
As my long-time readers are no doubt well aware, it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a company's earnings report before delving into an analysis of its results. This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis. Therefore, here are the highlights from Golden Ocean Group's third quarter 2019 earnings report:
It seems certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights is likely to notice is that essentially every measure of financial performance showed improvement compared to the prior year quarter. It also saw considerable improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. We can see that quite clearly here:
Source: Golden Ocean Group
The biggest reason for this is that the market for dry bulk charters was substantially stronger in the third quarter of this year than in the second. Golden Ocean Group notes that it saw the number of single voyage charters increase significantly. As I have explained in various past articles, there are two ways that the company's customers can hire a ship - time charter and voyage charter. A time charter is exactly what it sounds like in that the customer commits to hire the ship for an extended period of time at a contractually agreed upon rate. This is often used when the customer needs to send regular cargo shipments between points and wishes to lock in a price and ensure that it has a ship available as needed. The other way that a ship can be chartered is for a single voyage. This is essentially used when the customer needs to send cargo between points on a one-time basis. These single voyages are performed at a market-based price that is set at the time that the vessel is chartered. The fact that voyages picked up during the quarter appears to indicate that global trade picked up significantly in the third quarter compared to the second. This increased activity caused the company's TCE (time charter equivalent) to increase to $19,727 per day in the most recent quarter compared to $11,629 in the second quarter.
It may come as a surprise that dry bulk shipments picked up in the third quarter when we consider that, despite many erroneous reports of a trade deal, the tensions between the United States and China were running quite high during that period. Nevertheless, the total volume of dry bulk goods shipping during the quarter reached a new record. We can see that here:
Source: Maritime Analytics, Golden Ocean Group
One of the necessary things to understand this in light of the trade tensions is that the United States and China are not the only two countries in the world involved in the trade of dry bulk goods. For example, despite the fact that its steel production growth slowed to 5.5% by the end of the third quarter, China continues to import iron ore from Australia. There is the possibility that Chinese steel production began to contract in October but the country's iron ore stockpiles are still lower than a year ago so it may keep iron ore imports at a high level as it rebuilds its stockpiles. The Chinese also increased their imports of coal to record levels in the third quarter while South Korea and Japan also increased their coal imports. Unfortunately though, the Chinese import restrictions are in effect during November and December so the country will import less during these two months. Thus, there is the very real possibility that the fourth quarter will prove to be worse for the industry than the third one was.
As might be expected, this strength in the dry bulk market had a positive impact on day rates. We can see that here:
Source: Golden Ocean Group
As we can see above, the average spot day rate for every class of ship in Golden Ocean Group's fleet was higher than in either the previous or the prior year quarters. The biggest improvement though was in Capesize (the largest type) and to a lesser extent Panamax classes. This greatly benefited Golden Ocean Group as Capesize vessels make up the overwhelming majority of its fleet. The company also has a substantial number of Panamax class vessels. We can see that here:
Source: Golden Ocean Group
The company only has a limited number of Capesize vessels on time charter agreements though so the majority of them are trading in the spot market. Thus, any improvement in spot rates for these vessels, particularly one as large as we saw this quarter, will have a significant impact on the company's revenues and cash flows. That is exactly what we saw in this quarter.
As mentioned in the highlights, Golden Ocean Group recently acquired two 2019-built 103,000 ice-class Capesize vessels. This expands the company's fleet and potentially provides it with some forward growth potential. Only one of these ships was actually delivered in the third quarter, however. This was the MV Admiral Schmidt, which was acquired in September. The second vessel, MV Vitus Bering, was delivered in October. The nice thing about this acquisition is that both of these ships came with three-year charters. Therefore, the company can have confidence that it will be receiving steady amounts of both revenue and cash flows from both of these vessels over the next few years. In addition, each of these charters has an index-linked dayrate, which could prove to be a double-edged sword. If the spot market average price for these vessels increases, then Golden Ocean Group will see its revenues from the vessels increase, but the reverse is also true and the company could very easily see its revenues go down. Regardless though, the two vessels will still produce a more reliable revenue stream than the other vessels in its fleet because they will have steady employment.
In conclusion, this was a very solid quarter for Golden Ocean Group due to the exceptionally strong market for dry bulk shipping. Unfortunately though, there may be some reasons to believe that this is as good as it is going to get, at least for the remainder of this year. The company did see a few positive developments outside of the strong market though such as the recent acquisition of two Capesize vessels with three-year time charters. Overall then, there was a lot for investors to be pleased with here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moonday Mornings: IRS readies to tax your cryptocurrency — no matter what</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome to Monday, it’s the start of another week and that means it’s time for Hard Fork’s wrap-up of the weekend’s top cryptocurrency and blockchain headlines.
Take a look.
According to CNBC, the US Internal Revenue Service has released a new tax form, asking cryptocurrency traders to declare their holdings.
The IRS’ new “Schedule 1 for the 2019 tax season,” asks tax payers if they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired virtual currency by any other means over the past year.
Earlier this year, the IRS started sending letters to known cryptocurrency traders telling them to fess up about their trading habits.
In a similar move to the IRS, the government in South Korea is looking to levy taxes on citizens that trade cryptocurrency.
The Korea Times reports that the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance is exploring a revised bill to tax capital gains from cryptocurrency transactions. The bill is reportedly going to be drawn up early next year.
The that the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance confirmed that it’s exploring a revised bill to tax capital gains from cryptocurrency transactions. The bill is reportedly going to be drawn up early next year.
The latest Ethereum network update went live over the weekend. Dubbed “Istanbul,” the update was actioned at block number 9,069,000, Ethereum tweeted yesterday.
Istanbul features six major upgrades designed to improve the Ethereum network’s efficiency and operational speed. Read more about it here.
China’s central bank is reportedly going to test its digital currency in Shenzhen and Suzhou, The Block reports.
Four state-run commercial banks, in collaboration with three state-owned telecom companies, are reportedly working to find the best way to introduce the digital currency.
Earlier this year, Bank officials from the country said it had no timeline for the roll-out of its digital currency, but according to the latest report claims China’s central bank has accelerated the project in response to Facebook’s announcement of its own “cryptocurrency” Libra.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking to question messaging app Telegram’s former chief investment advisor. The SEC is asking John Hyman to testify and hand over documents about Telegram‘s suspicious token sale, writes CoinDesk.
The SEC had to ask the High Court of England and Wales to get hold of the information.
Telegram was supposed to distribute its blockchain-based token TON back in October, but has put that on hold to “maintain the status quo” until it settles the legal battle with the SEC.
Well there you have it, another weekend’s headlines caught up with. Now go get on with your week!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why I'm a libertarian defeatist about Medicare-for-all</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first time I heard the phrase "Medicare-for-all," I thought, "Oh, so that's how it happens. That's how America gets single-payer health care."
I'm not excited at the prospect. But I am resigned to its inevitability and unenthused about the realistic alternatives. I'm a libertarian health-care defeatist.
My reasoning here is pretty simple: As Americans from across the political spectrum agree, our present health insurance system sucks. Compared to similar countries, we pay more for worse outcomes — and the complexity! Heaven forbid anyone ever get a straightforward answer on what a procedure costs. The whole thing is intolerably expensive and convoluted.
Moreover, U.S. health care hasn't been in striking distance of a free market for decades, and the obstacles to getting there seem insurmountable. So if the principle of the thing is already irreparable, and I'm pretty sure it is, we may as well simplify. And Medicare-for-all — at once familiar and radical and sneakily difficult to argue against if you aren't also calling for an end to Medicare proper, which neither major party is — just might be the marketing that sells it. I'd be surprised if the United States didn't have some sort of universal, state-provided health care, maybe under the Medicare brand, within about 10 years.
A bit of history may here be in order. Contrary the suggestion of GOP apoplecticism c. 2010, ObamaCare was hardly the introduction of state meddling in the health-care market. Before the Affordable Care Act, the Cato Institute's Michael Tanner notes atNational Review, "[n]early all health care was subsidized in some way, either directly or indirectly." The government already "directly paid for more than half of all health-care spending," and the "third-party and even fourth-party payment mechanism[s]," which paid 87 cents of every health-care dollar, "insulated consumers from the cost of their health-care choices and drove up both spending and prices." Meanwhile, Tanner continues, "provider cartels, both insurers and medical professionals, used regulatory and licensing barriers to protect themselves from competition and inflate prices."
Two state interventions in the health-care market deserve special attention. One is employer-provided health insurance, a strange arrangement that exists because of a federal wage freeze during World War II. Employers seeking to offer more attractive compensation packages provided insurance instead of a raise. This workaround made sense given the regulations businesses then faced, but it seems unlikely we would have thus widely linked jobs and health care without the artificial incentive. The unfortunate result is health insurance can disappear when you need it most and the costs of routine care are warped and hidden from patients.
The second intervention is Medicare itself, which has produced dramatic price increases and distortions of care decisions. If the growth rate of health spending had remained consistent with the rest of the economy from the time Medicare was introduced to today, Americans now would spend around $220 billion annually, according to calculations from Georgetown Law's David A. Hyman and Charles Silver of the University of Texas. Instead, we spend around $3.4 trillion — a boggling spike even allowing for the correction of under-treatment and the introduction of new treatment options — and as much as $1 trillion of that goes to waste, fraud, and abuse. Furthermore, Hyman and Silver explain, providers' determination to extract every penny they can from Medicare sometimes results in the indefensible subjection of sick and dying people to tests and treatment they do not need.
Surely we can do better than this — but how? My ideal health-care system is probably about what you'd expect from a libertarian. I'll sketch it in three broad points.
First, I'd like routine care to operate more like chiropractors, massage therapists, vets, and some dentists, who offer clear pricing information that makes it easy to comparison shop.
Second, I think insurance should be an independent purchase, not an employment-linked benefit; that it should operate in a national, not state-constricted, market; and that it should function more like auto insurance, applying to catastrophic situations (major illnesses requiring extensive treatment and emergencies where there's no time for shopping around) rather than routine care. These changes make the first point doable.
Third, because I am not a Randian monster without a functioning conscience, I think there must be a robust charitable safety net to ensure everyone gets the care they need. Some of this would take the form of traditional giving, and it could also involve arrangements like that of the doula collective I hired while pregnant, where patients pay on an income-based sliding scale so the service is available to all.
But I don't expect anything like that in the foreseeable future. I wouldn't even place it in the "unlikely and difficult, but you have to hold out hope" category where I'd put major foreign policy reform. This just isn't going to happen. There are far too many powerful interests opposing it, and it is increasingly distant from what most Americans want.
That's not to say the average American is thrilled with the nuts and bolts of Medicare-for-all. Polling shows support plummets well below 50 percent when respondents are informed the program could entail ending private insurance, raising taxes, and limiting or delaying care options. I expect most or all of such negative predictions would prove true, and Medicare-for-all, though in some ways better than the present system, would be far from the panacea its supporters describe. The serious problems facing Medicare as it exists now, including insolvency and issues of pricing and care choices described above, will not be lessened by its expansion. But such details are not the focus of the pitch, which offers an attractively simple alternative to our current plight and, crucially, does so by expanding an existing program few meaningfully oppose.
Wouldn't it be nice to eliminate all this mess of enrollment periods and monthly premiums and switching insurance with every new job and figuring out if the doctor you want to see is in your network? Wouldn't it be nice to just go get treatment when you need it? And if you don't object to Medicare for the elderly, why would you object to it for everyone else? That's the immediately intelligible case for Medicare-for-all or something like it, and when proposed without details on its costs and drawbacks, it has the support of around seven in 10 Americans. If private insurance is not shut down, a federal insurance plan even gets the backing of five in 10 Republicans.
Almost no one likes the insurance system we have now, and the Overton Window on this is shifting rapidly. A mandate for Medicare-for-all may not come from this election, but I don't expect we'll close another decade without it.
It's a fact libertarians like me must face.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: Shoemaker Skechers USA is expected to post earnings growth on pace with Nike over the next three years, giving its relatively low valuation a chance of catching up, financial newspaper Barron's reported in its Dec 7 edition.
Analysts estimate Skechers' earnings-per-share will rise 15 per cent this year and in 2020, and 12 per cent in 2021. Yet Nike trades at about 30 times analysts' future earnings estimates, compared with 16 times for Sketchers, even after Skechers shares soared more than 75 per cent this year, the paper said.
Skechers sells trainers, dress shoes, sandals and boots - a broader range than Nike - and has grown over the past 20 years to become the third-largest global footwear brand by revenue, after Nike and Adidas, the paper said.
Skechers styles, often priced at US$50 to US$70, are perceived as "cool" and good value, an edge its bigger rivals lack, Barron's added.
"Nike and Adidas are reluctant to identify as value brands, giving Skechers room to run," Barron's said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chong: Sugar supply liberalisation will benefit consumers in the long run</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUCHING, Dec 9 — The liberalisation policy on sugar supply in Sarawak will not result in an immediate effect to the price of the commodity but will definitely benefit consumers in the long term, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Deputy Minister Chong Chieng Jen said today.
He said the policy, however, broke up the monopolies held by certain companies which dictated the supply and price of sugar in the state in the past, thus lowering the costs of business and reducing inflation in the long run.
“The main difference between the present PH government and the past BN (Barisan Nasional) government is that the BN government creates monopolies, thereby increases the cost of business which ultimately leads to prices of goods increases,” he said in a statement.
The statement came following the revelation of 11 companies which had been given the permit to import sugar to the state recently through the liberalisation of supply policy.
“The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs will continue with its liberalisation of sugar policy and open to applications by any F&B (food and beverages) manufacturers in Sarawak, (whether) big or small, and we don’t need connection like it used to be during BN’s time,” he added. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dollar holds ground as central bank meetings loom, pound jumps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON, Dec 9 — The dollar held its ground today thanks to last week’s stronger-than-expected jobs data, although worries about US/China trade talks kept gains in check, while Britain’s pound jumped on the latest polls ahead of this week’s election.
Sterling hit a fresh 2-1/2 year high against the euro after the latest opinion polls showed the governing Conservative Party has extended its lead over rivals ahead of Thursday’s national election.
Meanwhile, the dollar stood its ground in the wake of Friday’s jobs data. Attention shifted to US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policy meetings this week, while a deadline looms for the next wave of US tariffs on Chinese goods to kick in.
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that a December 15 deadline is still in place to impose a new round of US tariffs on Chinese consumer goods, but President Donald Trump likes where trade talks with China are going.
“If we see Donald Trump decide not to delay tariffs, that would lead to a risk off reaction in markets,” said Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester.
“We don’t expect tariffs to go into effect as the talks are ongoing,” he said, adding he did not expect any “fireworks” from the central bank meetings.
The dollar index was little changed at 97.63, after rising 0.3 per cent on Friday on news that US nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain in 10 months.
Europe’s single currency traded at US$1.1064 (RM4.60), after hitting a one-week low of US$1.10395 on Friday.
The dollar changed hands at 108.52 yen. It had lifted to 108.92 yen on the US jobs data before losing momentum.
Analysts said Friday’s jobs numbers was positive for the greenback, bolstering expectations that the Fed would this week continue to signal a pause in its rate-cutting cycle.
“As long as more people are working and getting paid more, consumer demand is likely to hold up – that should keep the US economy going and reduce the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates again,” said Marshall Gittler, strategist at ACLS Global.
Data meanwhile showing China’s exports shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November, underscored persistent pressures on manufacturers from the Sino-US trade war.
Elsewhere, sterling rallied to a seven-month high at US$1.3180 and to a 2-1/2 year peak versus the euro at 83.94 as the latest polls fuelled optimism that Thursday’s election will end near-term Brexit uncertainty.
The ruling Conservative Party extended its lead over the opposition Labour Party to 14 percentage points, up from 9 a week ago, an opinion poll by Survation for ITV’s Good Morning Britain showed on Monday. — Reuters

    <h5 class="mb-1">Malaysians spend 70pc of monthly income on goods, housing and transport, says minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — Almost 70 per cent of Malaysians’ monthly income are spent on goods, housing and transport, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said.
Based on a World Bank Group report, the cost of living shouldered by Malaysians was mainly due to the three said components, he said.
“In addition, the report states that the lower the people’s income, the more they spend on food, while those with higher income spend more on leisure such as travel or to visit recreational clubs and so on.
“So from here we can see that when there is a cost price increase of goods and the low income group are the most affected,” he told reporters after launching the Malaysia Economic Monitor’s latest update — “Making Ends Meet” here today.
The 21st edition of the report also touched on income stagnation when cost of living rises, he said.
In view of this, he said his ministry, in its capacity as the secretariat of the National Cost of Living Action Council (NACCOL) will adopt several initiatives to overcome the problem.
“I have some ideas on the shifts needed on focus and priorities and how NACCOL can move into 2020 we cannot be contended with what we have now, we must do more than this,” he said.
Meanwhile, Saifuddin Nasution in his speech said NACCOL is currently looking into reducing the prices of food items and increasing the income of food producers by eliminating layers of middlemen in the food supply chain.
“Recently I visited fisherman jetty in Sekinchan and Sungai Besar and spoke to fishermen, the price of indian mackerel cost only RM5 to RM6 per kilogram (kg) and about 1.5 kilometer away from the jetty at the wet market the price is RM13 per kg.
“I have given instruction to my secretary-general (Datuk Muez Abdul Aziz) to really look into it and we are committed to work with Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry regarding this matter. For the coming year, this will be one of my main priorities in our efforts to reduce the cost of living,” he said.
Moving forward, the government will continue to improve public transportation services, particularly last-mile connectivity as well as creating more affordable housing and also introducing creative, innovative schemes to boost and reduce the burden of home ownership, he said.
He added that through his ministry, Food Bank Malaysia and Food Bank Siswa programmes were initiated, which to date, have provided food security to over 400,000 families and 7,000 university students. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">European companies minimise risks from US-China trade war</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING, Dec 9 — European companies in China have been able to minimise the effect from the tariff war between Beijing and Washington, although some are considering relocating their businesses, the EU Chamber of Commerce said today.
The world’s two biggest economies have been entangled in a lingering trade war for over a year, which has weighed on the global economy and resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs slapped on two-way trade.
European companies in China “have effectively negated the tariff effects in a relatively short space of time,” said the president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, Joerg Wuttke.
Many companies have “effectively side-stepped” the steep tariffs by rejigging their supply chains and leveraging their global corporate networks, the chamber said in a statement.
According to a survey of its members released Monday, 64 per cent of respondents said they have not noticed “any change” in their business as a result of the trade war.
Another 10 per cent said they were “completely affected” by the trade war.
However, many European companies said they expected the trade war to be “long-lasting”, and 10 per cent have already changed suppliers.
At the time of the survey, another eight per cent had already relocated parts of their business out of China or were planning to do so — mainly to elsewhere in southeast Asia — while 15 per cent had delayed investment or expansion decisions because of the trade war.
This figure was up from six per cent since the previous survey in January.
The report, which surveyed 174 companies in China, was completed in September and is released as China and the US continue to negotiate a way to reach a “phase one” trade deal.
In the absence of any agreement, Washington is threatening to impose 15 per cent additional customs surcharges on December 15, which will apply to Chinese goods which have so far been spared, including cellphones and sportswear.
They account for some US$160 billion in annual imports. — AFP

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — IHH Healthcare Bhd hopes to complete its proposed acquisition of the Prince Court Medical Centre in the first quarter of 2020, following the strong approval obtained from its shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting today.
In a statement, the healthcare provider said over 99.99 per cent of non-interested shareholders and proxies voted in favour of the conditional share purchase agreement valued for a cash consideration of RM1.02 billion.
Joe Sim, chief executive officer, Malaysia Operations Division said Prince Court would empower IHH to bring its best-in-class care and outcomes to even more patients in Malaysia and abroad.
“With a broader network and stronger cluster of specialised tertiary hospitals in the Klang Valley, supported by a deeper clinical talent pool, IHH can offer a wider array of services and take on more complex cases.
“This will make our facilities even more compelling for both local and foreign patients, and further reinforces Malaysia’s attractiveness as a medical travel destination,” he said.
Strategically located in the Golden Triangle of Kuala Lumpur, Prince Court is a 277-licensed bed private healthcare facility offering a wide range of services, including burns management, cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, interventional cardiology, in vitro fertilisation, nephrology, occupational health, orthopaedic, and rehabilitation medicine.
IHH said Prince Court is a profitable operation that is expected to enhance the group’s revenue and income stream, and contribute to its long-term growth. — Bernama

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — Bursa Malaysia finished lower today on subdued sentiments as weak export data from China, the country’s biggest trading partner, signalled weakness for the broader Asian economy.
At 5pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) fell 5.73 points to 1,562.71 from Friday’s close of 1,568.44.
The barometer index opened 2.26 points lower at 1,566.18 and moved between 1,560.2 and 1,567.78 throughout the day.
A dealer said the softer export data had also offset the positive Wall Street clues following solid US jobs print.
“Investor sentiment was hit after data projected that China exports in November shrank for the fourth straight month, implying that the trade war with the United States was taking a toll on the world’s second-largest economy,” he said.
On the local bourse, heavyweight Maybank added six sen to RM8.56.
TNB lost 20 sen to RM13.22, Public Bank fell 14 sen to RM19.02, Petronas Chemicals shed five sen to RM7.05 and CIMB eased two sen to RM5.18.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Packaging Forum urges Gov support to advance war on plastic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The country’s leading packaging member-based organisation is eager to work with Government to bring an end to plastic waste in New Zealand.
The Packaging Forum, which represents the depth and breadth of the country’s packaging industry, supports the creation of a National Plastics Action Plan including focusing on three priority areas; standardised nationwide kerbside recycling which will enable the roll out of nationally recognised “how and where” to recycle labelling on packaging, which in turn will support investment in onshore processing facilities.
This follows the release yesterday (8 December) of the Rethinking Plastics in Aotearoa New Zealand report by the Office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Professor Juliet Gerrard.
The Forum’s Independent Chair Rob Langford says the report contains a number of important areas of focus. “We absolutely agree we need a National Plastics Action Plan – one which is led by industry and supported by Government,” he says. “Industry needs to lead this as they are the experts on the vital role packaging has to play in containing and protecting food and other products as they move through the supply chain to the consumer.”
The Forum already delivers a number of voluntary product stewardship solutions and projects including those for plastic packaging. In July 2018, The Forum’s members pledged to make all their packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable (in NZ) by 2025.
“The pledge shows industry is already taking steps to lead the way to a plastics waste-free future through their commitment to product stewardship.”
For there to be significant action on reducing plastic waste in particular it is important that not only industry take action, but consumers and recyclers are part of the solution, facilitated by Government action, Rob says.
The Forum supports a consistent on-pack recycling labelling system which clearly indicates to consumers how and where to recycle the packaging, and that it has integrity and compliance enforced by an independent government agency.
However, one significant obstacle in launching a national recycling label is that what can be recycled at kerbside varies from council to council around the country, he says.
“The effectiveness of a recycling label will only be as good as the consistency of recycling services nationwide for the packaging material. Until we have consistency of what can be recycled at kerbside across New Zealand to at least 60% coverage, then all labels would need to refer back to the manufacturer or the Council and that defeats the purpose of the label.
“Therefore, we strongly recommend that any announcement about a labelling system goes hand in hand with an announcement to standardise recycling services.”
Investment in onshore processing facilities for the collected material is also vitally important, Rob says. “To move to a circular economy, we have to develop onshore recycling capacity and add value to our collected materials rather than relying on other countries to recycle our waste.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tata Motors plans to add 100 new passenger vehicle outlets by FY 20 end</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Auto major Tata Motors plans to add 100 sales outlets for passenger vehicles by the end of the current fiscal as it aims to enhance its reach in the country, a senior company official said.
The company, which has around 860 sales outlets spread across the country, has already added up around 100 outlets in the current financial year till now.
"We are expanding sales network. Basically, we are getting into new locations. Idea is that per dealer sales should go up. Dealers are excited with our product range and they are willing to expand their territories by opening new outlets," Tata Motors President (Passenger Vehicles Business Unit) Mayank Pareek told PTI.
There was a plan to add 200 new sales outlets this fiscal, he added.
"Of this 100 has already been added this fiscal, and in rest of the months we will add another 100 showrooms," Pareek said.
The company used to add just 100 showrooms per financial year, and this year has been an exception, he noted.
"With new outlets, the total count would go up to around 960 showrooms by the end of 2019-20," Pareek said.
He, however, added that the company is also in the process of closing various dealerships which have been under performing.
"These are people who are not interested in raising the bar and are unable to face the tough market situation situation right now," Pareek said.
When asked about the number of such dealerships facing closure, he declined to share details, terming it as a "continuous process".
Tata Motors is looking to increase its penetration in the domestic passenger vehicle segment with entry into the premium hatchback segment.
With its new model Altroz, the company aims to enhance its presence to around 60 per cent of the total passenger vehicle market.
"We now have two platforms -- Alfa and Omega. Our plan is that in each of these platforms we should have 6-7 top heads which could be small hatch, big hatch, mid hatch, mini van, MPV, small sedan, big sedan etc," Pareek said.
The company has also developed a lot of concepts, the idea being that in the next 4-5 years, it should be able to cover 90 per cent of the market, he added.
"Even with Altroz, the company would just be able to cover around 60 per cent of the market," Pareek said.
Altroz, which comes with BS-VI compliant petrol and diesel powertrains, is set for launch next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here's why Saudi Aramco's stock is unlikely to plunge on its debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When shares of Saudi Arabia’s national oil company begin trading Wednesday after the world’s largest initial public offering, the stars will be aligned to ensure that the stock price holds up.
Aramco sold $25.6 billion of shares at 32 riyals each, the top of the range at which they were marketed, and the company had orders for $119 billion of stock. About 4.9 million individual investors, almost 15% of the kingdom’s population, applied for the shares. Saudi Arabia sold only 1.5% of the company’s capital in the IPO.
That unsatisfied demand alone should ensure a strong first day of trading. But Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman isn’t leaving anything to chance. From bonus shares to a fat dividend, there’s a lot to underpin the price, at least initially. His half-brother, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, predicted Friday that Aramco’s value will soon surge, just after the kingdom announced production cuts that were taken as supportive for oil prices.
“I see further upside to the stock after listing due to the fact that investors will be chasing the stock to complete their exposure, since the deal was oversubscribed,” said Ali El Adou, head of asset management at Daman Investiments in Dubai. Aramco shares also will be supported by the company’s dividend plans and strong balance sheet, he said.
For now, at least, the IPO also has the benefit of an increase in the broader market. The main equity index in Riyadh was up 0.9% at 12:45 p.m. local time, extending gains this week to 3.4%.
Here’s a look at some of the other reasons why the stock is unlikely to plunge on its debut.
Keep Them Now, Get More Soon
Individual investors in Saudi Arabia were heavily targeted by a country-wide marketing campaign prior to the IPO. Retail investors who hold the shares for 180 days from the first day of trading will be eligible to receive one share for every 10 held. The maximum bonus shares will be 100 per investor.
To boost demand, authorities allowed lenders to provide credit for stock purchases at a proportion that was twice the usual for IPOs. That might have helped inflate demand for the offering. Of course, if the stock falls in the short term, that could result in mark-to-market losses on margin loans for the banks, said Edmond Christou, who follows banks for Bloomberg Intelligence in Dubai.
Guaranteed Dividends
Aramco’s board said the company will pay at least $75 billion of ordinary dividends in 2020, in addition to any potential special payouts. Investors were given the guarantee that the dividend won’t fall until after 2024, regardless of what happens to oil prices. Dividend sustainability is supported by stable cash flows and the company’s relatively small planned increase in capital spending, amid other factors, analysts at KAMCO Investment Co. wrote in a note on Dec. 4.
The Invisible Hand
Traders, investors and analysts in the past have speculated that funds tied to the Saudi government have stepped in to prop up the stock market, especially at moments of increased geopolitical volatility. In a poll of 24 money managers last month, 22 said they expect Aramco shares to be supported by government-related funds once they start trading.
The Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, didn’t respond to a request for comment on whether it will buy Aramco shares in the secondary market.
Fast Track to Indexes
Aramco is so big that index compilers will speed up its inclusion in global benchmarks. MSCI Inc., which provides the most popular emerging-markets equity index, said last month that Aramco will be added by the close of Dec. 17 if it starts trading on or before Dec. 12. The inclusion by MSCI should trigger about $2.4 billion in flows into the stock, according to estimates by Saudi Fransi Capital. FTSE Russell also has said it’s studying the potential fast-track inclusion of the stock in its benchmarks.
One of a Kind
The Gulf is a benchmark globally for oil exploration, with Saudi Arabia seen as the de facto leader of OPEC countries. But the Saudi company is actually the first major oil producer in the region to be publicly traded. It gives local investors a rare chance to directly tap the industry.
Markets being what they are, all of the above is no guarantee that the stock will surge, or how long it will stay up. Many international money managers spurned the offering, saying the valuation was too high, especially compared to other oil majors and their fat dividends.
“The over-subscription will insure there is elevated demand in the secondary market once it starts trading, but I am not sure how sustainable that demand will be if the share price moves higher than 32 riyals per share,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, the chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital Ltd. in Abu Dhabi. “One thing is for sure, there will be volatile sessions initially until the market arrives at equilibrium price.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adityanath govt clears Rs 1,600 cr Ballia Link Expressway project</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Uttar Pradesh cabinet today cleared the decks for the proposed Ballia Link Expressway project, which is estimated to cost Rs 1,600 crore.
The project would link Ballia district on the UP-Bihar border with the under-construction Purvanchal Expressway, which is aimed at connecting the backward eastern UP region with central UP at Lucknow, and via Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Greater Noida-Agra Expressway with the National Capital Region (NCR).
In the state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Adityanath this morning, the government gave its nod for preparing the detailed project report (DPR) for the project.
The four-lane expressway, expected to be 35-40 km long, is likely to cost almost Rs 40 crore per km, thus entailing maximum investment of Rs 1,600 crore.
According to UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) CEO, the Ballia Link Expressway would provide seamless road connectivity from the NCR to the UP-Bihar border areas and give impetus to trade and socio-economic development.
The 353 km Purvanchal Expressway, estimated to cost Rs 23,000 crore, would cut across Lucknow, Barabanki, Faizabad, Ambedkarnagar, Amethi, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur.
On November 11, the Adityanath government had cleared the decks for two other mega expressway projects totalling more than Rs 14,500 crore in Bundelkhand and Eastern UP regions.
These two projects include the 296-km Bundelkhand Expressway and the 91-km Gorakhpur Link Expressway, estimated to cost Rs 9,921 crore (including land cost of Rs 2,202 crore) and Rs 4,587 crore (including land cost of Rs 1,564 crore) respectively.
While these two projects are estimated to be completed in 36 months each, the concessionaries would be paid five per cent incentive of the contracted amount, if they complete the project in 30 months.
Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur Link expressways have been divided into 6 and 2 packages respectively for their speedier completion.
For Bundelkhand Expressway, the cabinet cleared the proposal to award different packages to selected bidder viz. Apco Infratech, Ashoka Buildcon, Gawar Construction and Dilip Buildcon.
Bundelkhand Expressway would span Jhansi, Banda, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah districts, and touch Agra-Lucknow Expressway at Etawah.
The government has already released Rs 2,157 crore towards land acquisition in the project, while Rs 7,000 crore in bank loan had been availed of.
For the Gorakhpur Link Expressway, the cabinet approved awarding of the contract to the lowest bidders Apco Infratech and Dilip Buildcon. The project spans Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar and Azamgarh districts. While, UP has already released Rs 940 crore towards land acquisition, Rs 2,275 crore had been taken from banks as loans to complete the ambitious project that relates to Adityanath’s pocket borough.
Currently, several projects are under various stages of development under UPEIDA, namely, Agra-Lucknow Expressway, Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway, Ganga Expressway, Ballia Link Expressway, Defence Manufacturing Corridor, and Semi High-speed Rail Corridor.

The minister said that for creating a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor and the under-privileged, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the two schemes in the insurance sector on pan-India basis on May 9, 2015 in Kolkata.
"As per information furnished by banks, 5.91 crore people have been enrolled under PMJJBY and 15.47 crore people enrolled under the PMSBY as on March 31, 2019," she said during the Question Hour.
The PMJJBY offers life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh in case of death due to any reason to people in the age group of 18-50 years having a bank or post office account, who give their consent to join or enable auto-debit of premium of Rs 330 per annum.
The PMSBY offers insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh for accidental death or total permanent disability and Rs 1 lakh for partial permanent disability to people in the age group of 18-70 years with a bank or post office account, who give their consent to join or enable auto-debit of premium of Rs 12 per annum.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Beleaguered Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd.’s sale of its technology park to Blackstone Group Inc. is stalled as one of its creditors hasn’t approved the deal, people with the knowledge of the matter said.
Yes Bank Ltd. hasn’t issued the so-called no objection certificate as it’s seeking assurances on repayments of other loans taken by Coffee Day, said the people, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. All other creditors have approved the transaction, the people said.
Shares of Coffee Day extended decline to as much as 14.5% in Mumbai, which is the biggest drop since July 31.
Coffee Day, which runs India’s largest coffee chain, has been trying to sell its assets to repay its debt after the unexpected death of its founder billionaire V.G. Siddhartha. On Aug. 14, the company announced that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell Global Village Tech Park to Blackstone in a deal valued at 26 billion rupees ($366 million) to 30 billion rupees.
Tanglin Developments Ltd., a unit of Coffee Day that controls Global Village Tech Park in Bangalore, owes Yes Bank about 1 billion rupees, according to the people. In addition, Coffee Day also owes the lender about 14 billion rupees, the people said.
Yes Bank could eventually approve the transaction, one of the people said. Representatives for Blackstone, Coffee Day and Yes Bank declined to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Yes Bank likely to reject $1.2 bn offer from Canadian tycoon Erwin Braich</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yes Bank Ltd. is likely to reject an offer that made up more than half of its planned $2 billion capital raising, and is talking to institutional investors about making up the shortfall, according to a person familiar with the matter.
At a meeting on Tuesday, the board is expected to reject an offer from Canada’s Erwin Singh Braich and Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings to contribute $1.2 billion toward the fund raising, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
After initially dropping on the news, Yes Bank shares reversed the losses to trade 1.9% higher. They are down 17% since it announced the names of the investors for its proposed preferential issue at the end of last month.
Doubts over key foreign bidders have triggered concerns that the Reserve Bank of India might not allow them to take ownership stakes in the lender. Braich has battled members of his family and creditors in numerous lawsuits, according to Canadian court records.
The bank would prefer to have institutions rather than individual investors involved in its fund raising, said the person, who declined to name the companies in discussions with the bank.
“This is purely speculative and Yes Bank does not, as a matter of policy, comment on market speculation,” Yes Bank said in an emailed response to a request for comment.
Yes Bank needs new investors in order to replenish its capital, which has fallen close to the regulatory minimum following hefty provisions against bad loans. Getting strong investors is important for the capital-starved lender, which has also been hurt by the country’s deepening shadow banking crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fashion Industry Warns the World to Heed Dire Climate Warnings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The global fashion industry will on Monday draw on what it describes as its own “social and cultural weight” to lead the world into tackling climate change, using the stage of the United Nations COP25 conference in Madrid to announce its master plan for global self-sufficiency.
Retailers and industrial groups say they will expose the conclusions of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (Ficca), signed last year by 43 companies, in an effort to tackle critisism which sees the fashion industry accused of encouraging over-consumption, excessive waste generation, hazardous chemical use and worker exploitation.
It is estimated some 73 percent of textile fibers used to produce more than 100 billion garments each year around the world end up in landfill or incinerators after they have been used.
Iconic UK brand Burberry sparked a furor last year when it admitted it had destroyed almost $40 million worth of unsold goods on the simple premise that the items were no longer in fashion.
According to fashion journal MDS, the new fashion agreement includes reaching a carbon neutral economy by 2050, and reducing emissions by 30 percent until 2030. Ficca was signed in the previous Climate Change Conference in Katowice (Poland) and was supported by Inditex, Kering, Adidas, Burberry, H&M, Gap, Levi Strauss and Target, among others.
Monday’s presentation at the two-week climate conference in Madrid will see the conclusions of the seven focus groups: decarbonization pathway and GHG emission reductions; raw materials; manufacturing and energy; logistics (through Clean Cargo Group1); policy engagement; leveraging existing tools and initiatives and promoting broader climate action.
The rush by the fashion industry to join the climate debate comes just months after it was exposed as having a carbon impact bigger than the airline industry.
Now it wants to use the elite, globalist COP25 conference as the start of its own journey on the road to redemption.

That could take some doing.
The apparel and footwear industries together accounted for more than eight percent of global climate impacts — the equivalent of 3,990 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2016, according to a report from Quantis.
Total emissions related to textiles production are equal to 1.2 billion tons annually — more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping trips combined, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
In April fashion houses in New York were condemned for the monumental amounts of waste they generate every year in the form of discarded, unused fabric as well as clothes that are worn once and then discarded in the name of fashion.
Activists have also targeted the highly profitable “fast-fashion” industry, which churns out new low-cost garments daily or weekly to maximize sales volumes, calling on retailers to improve labor and environmental conditions at supplier factories in the impoverished developing world.
As Breitbart News reported, global fashion houses are infamous for seeking suppliers in countries such as China, Bangladesh, Egypt, Cambodia, Guatemala, India and Indonesia, which have massive problems with pollution as well as near non-existent labor laws.
In one of the world’s worst industrial accidents, more than 1,100 people died in April 2013 in the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, where workers reportedly produced garments for Western retailers such as Walmart, Benetton and Joe Fresh.
The United States subsequently suspended trade privileges for Bangladesh out of concern for labor rights.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unicorn Scooter Company Finds Profit To Be A Mythical Beast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It takes a special kind of audacity for your startup to be successful, and a special kind of audacity to name your startup “Unicorn”. Sadly, the overlapping of those two audacious circles did not spell success for one scooter company.
Unicorn’s founder, Nick Evans, sent an email to customers saying that Unicorn “totally failed as a business,” and that they would not be delivering any scooters and could not refund any money. According to The Verge, the company spent all its money on advertising, marketing and other expenses. Once all of that was covered, none was left over for actually making and delivering the scooters.
“Unfortunately, the cost of the ads were [sic] just too expensive to build a sustainable business,” Evans said in the email.
Unicorn joined a very crowded market a bit too late and with too little funding to compete with scooter companies that have been burning through cash in a losing business. Its scooters were to cost $US699 ($1,022) and had features like GPS tracking, similar to Tile, a company co-founded by Evans.
I’ve never understood the strategy of “the startup”, even though I’ve spent most of my career in and around it. To me, it has often seemed like a non-strategy; a place where enthusiastic people throw billions of dollars of spaghetti at the wall. And sometimes billions of dollars of ads at Facebook.
In any case, Unicorns don’t exist, anymore.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ericsson will pay a yard to settle bribery charges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COMPANY YOU'D FORGOTTEN STILL EXISTED Ericsson has been ordered to pay fines equivalent to $1bn (£760m) after US courts found it had engaged in bribery offences in a "years-long" campaign.
The US Department of Justice found that the company had been using bungs in five countries - Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Kuwait - to "solidify its grip on telecommunications business".  It's thought that the offences occurred between 2000 and 2016 - stretching back to the days when it was still manufacturing handsets with the best of them.
The payout marks a record for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) with a $520m penalty to the Justice Department and a further $540m going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ericsson is understood to have put aside over a billion in case of damages in its accounting for the year ahead.
US Attorney Geoffrey S Berman of the Southern District of New York said: "Through slush funds, bribes, gifts, and graft, Ericsson conducted telecom business with the guiding principle that 'money talks'.
He added that the fine "should communicate clearly to all corporate actors that doing business this way will not be tolerated".
"Ericsson's corrupt conduct involved high-level executives and spanned 17 years and at least five countries, all in a misguided effort to increase profits," said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.
Ericsson hasn't commented so far beyond a statement prior to the verdict, which said that it would cough up the readies to "resolve the government's investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of the Company's scheme to make and improperly record tens of millions of dollars in improper payments around the world".
As part of the settlement, Ericsson has also agreed to continue to assist with the investigation and any further charges against named individuals, improve its compliance programme and maintain an independent compliance monitor for three years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Goldman Plans To Launch Robo Adviser Next Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Goldman Sachs is planning to launch digital wealth management services to customers with as little as $5,000 in 2020.
The company is also planning to launch a robo adviser next year, offering a solution for clients with as little as “$5,000, $10,000 or $15,000” to invest, Joe Duran, founder of the United Capital wealth management firm that Goldman acquired earlier this year, told The Financial Times. While the minimum investment hasn’t been finalized yet, it will be “significantly lower” than Goldman’s traditional accounts.
“It’s a pipeline for future clients,” said Duran, adding that the robo adviser would start out with clients “with low complexity, not that much in assets.”
He admitted that his company’s integration with Goldman was happening “a lot quicker than I would have guessed” and there is now a bigger opportunity than the original goal of doubling its $25 billion of assets under management within three years. He explained that United Capital has already carried out trials with clients found through Ayco, Goldman’s employee financial counselling service.
“We’ve already picked up millions of dollars of new clients from those relationships,” Duran said. “The demand is higher than I expected — corporate entities love having a local adviser who can meet with them face to face.” He added that referrals from Goldman’s private bank were a “much bigger growth area than originally envisioned.”
The robo adviser will be offered both to United Capital’s direct clients, as well as outside advisers who use United Capital’s FinLife wealth management platform.
“We have a lot of clients who have kids and are in relationships with people who don’t have their [level of] assets,” said Duran. He said the typical account size is expected to be higher than other robo advisers such as Betterment, which has no minimum investment amount, “because of the kind of people the [Goldman] brand attracts.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">State AGs To Fight T-Mobile-Sprint Merger In Federal Trial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A group of state attorneys general are getting set to fight against the T-Mobile and Sprint merger in an unprecedented federal trial.
Sprint and T-Mobile announced the $26 billion deal last year. The all-stock deal has T-Mobile exchanging 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share. T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company — which will be known as T-Mobile — and Sprint parent SoftBank Group will own 27 percent. The remaining 31 percent will be held by the public.
In October, the merger officially received enough votes to win approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). But now this case, which begins on Monday (December 9) and includes 13 states and the District of Columbia, all led by Democratic AGs, is seeking to block it, arguing that the merger of two companies offering steep discounts could make cell phone plans more expensive.
Legal experts say it is unprecedented for the states to attempt to block a merger of this size, and a victory for the AGs could give states newfound power regarding antitrust enforcement when it comes to tech companies.
If the states prevail, “companies will have to take them more seriously,” New York University law professor Harry First said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “They’ll have to have really serious discussions with states like California and New York.”
“If we have another four years of the Trump administration, we may see more of this,” he added.
Judge Victor Marrero will be overseeing the case in federal court in New York, with the trial expected to last about three weeks. Various executives will testify, including T-Mobile boss John Legere, Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure and Dish Network Corp. Chairman Charlie Ergen.
Last week a meeting to discuss an out-of-court settlement was canceled, but there is still the chance for both sides to reach a deal during the trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Regulators ponder new rules to temper Big Tech data advantage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Global banking regulators say the arrival of Big Tech firms like Google, Amazon and Apple in financial services poses a host of stability risks that may require sweeping new laws to level the playing field with smaller tech firms and banks.
The report by the Financial Stability Board acknowledges that the entry of Big Tech firms into finance has numerous benefits, including the potential for greater innovation, diversification and efficiency in the provision of financial services. "However, Big Tech firms may also pose risks to financial stability," states the report.Some risks are similar to those from financial firms more broadly, stemming from leverage, maturity transformation and liquidity mismatches, as well as operational risks. More worrying is Big Tech's capacity to scale and ultimately come to dominate given their significant resources and widespread access to customer data. The FSB hints that the imposition of Open Banking rules that force incumbent financial services firms to share customer data with third party providers, may have to shift into reverse in the case of Big Tech, to create a more level-playing field for banks and smaller fintech firms to compete.“Big Tech firms’ ability to leverage customer data raises the question of whether - and the degree to which - authorities could consider the potential to promote the mobility of data between the various actors that are involved in the provision of financial services,” the FSB states. “Doing so may help encourage competition and help ensure a level playing field amongst market participants.” The FSB says regulators and supervisors also need to be mindful of the resilience and the viability of the business models of incumbent firms given interlinkages with, and competition from, Big Tech firms.Similarly, third-party dependencies in cloud services create a number of operational, governance and oversight considerations, the FSB believes, particularly in a cross-border context linked to the potential concentration of Big Tech providers, like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. While there do not appear to be immediate financial stability risks stemming from the use of cloud services by financial institutions, the FSB remains in watchful mode, suggesting that further assessment of regulatory standards, information sharing and interoperability across cloud providers could be merited.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Starling Bank has announced a partnership with legal services provider Sparqa, the latest addition to the challenger's in-app Marketplace.
Providing Starling’s 88,000 small business customers with customisable and affordable legal services, the lawtech partnership will enable the Starling customer base to access a wealth of legal information tailored to their specific commercial needs.Starling CEO and founder Anne Boden explains that “businesses are looking to technology to help them solve old problems in new, innovative and cost-effective ways, which is why Sparqa Legal is a very welcome addition to the Starling Marketplace”.Designed by leading UK barristers and solicitors, Sparqa enables businesses to reduce costs by minimising reliance on traditional legal services. Employment contracts, commercial agreements and trademark applications, to documents covering health and safety and data protection, among others, are provided by the lawtech.Sparqa is currently the only legal advisor on the bank’s marketplace, with other vendors covering accountancy software, credit facilities, and insurance.This type of lawtech partnership is only likely to become more prevalent throughout 2020 as banks look to prioritise customer experience by streamlining services across their platforms, and startups with a targeted customer base look for more avenues to connect with the consumer.Andrew Thornton, CEO of Sparqa Legal and barrister at Erskine Chambers says: “At Sparqa Legal, we passionately believe that, armed with the right tools and resources, smart business managers can produce many of the simple legal documents they require. They can also find out about their rights, obligations and the best course to take.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bison Trails Founder on Libra Membership & $25.5M Funding Round</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The adoption of blockchain technology is on the rise–slowly, perhaps, but surely. The market has grown considerably over the last several years, and is expected to continue to increase in size; analyst Shanghong Liu predicts that global spending on blockchain infrastructure will increase to $16 billion by the year 2023, up nearly seven times from the $2.7 that is projected to have been spent this year.
Therefore, the demand for services that can help companies and other organizations build out their blockchain platforms is likely to increase considerably. Recently, Finance Magnates spoke to Joe Lallouz, founder and CEO of Bison Trails. Bison Trails is an NYC-based blockchain infrastructure firm that helps to build enterprise-grade solutions for entities that offer blockchain-based products and services.

Bison trails is also a founding member of the Libra Association and completed a $25.5 million funding round last month. We asked Joe about Bison Trails’ decision to join Libra, how Bison Trails plans to use its funding, what the future holds for the company, and what needs to happen before the world sees mainstream adoption of blockchain.
Joe Lallouz explained to Finance Magnates that the firm works to provide “a multi-cloud, geographically distributed infrastructure platform with enterprise-grade security, orchestration, redundancy, and scaling to run highly efficient nodes on blockchain networks.”
What does this mean on a practical level? “Running nodes that participate on blockchain protocols is very challenging,” Joe explained. So, Bison Trails has “built a VPS-independent platform that makes running participation node clusters effortless, helping to keep decentralized networks decentralized.”
For example, Bison Trails could be hired to help entities that have built decentralized applications (dApps) on top of a blockchain network run the operations necessary to make sure that their dApp is functioning properly.
“We’re also protocol-agnostic,” Joe added. “We want to help grow the entire blockchain ecosystem, to democratize access, and to enable the pioneers of tomorrow.”
Therefore, Bison Trails’ goal is to “increase reliability while reducing costs and overhead for our customers. By serving as a dedicated team of Protocol, Security, DevOps, and Infrastructure Engineering experts, we remove the need for our customers to develop those capacities in-house.”
“We help our customers with all of their infrastructure needs: launching; managing, monitoring, and scaling; securing their infrastructure; and handling network upgrades,” he continued.
Joe explained that “our technology platform provides enterprise-grade security, multi-cloud and multi-region distribution, and a 99.99% uptime guarantee.”
The service is available to “anyone looking for an easier way to participate in established and emerging blockchain networks or those looking to implement blockchain infrastructures into their businesses.”
“Our focus is providing validating infrastructure for custodians, exchanges, Fortune 500 companies, and funds. We’re the preferred infrastructure provider for key protocol projects & a trusted brand,” Joe added.
So far, Bison Trails has been hired by “leading exchanges, custodians, funds and token-holders. Our platform is unique and live, ahead of major protocol launches.”
Bison Trails is also a founding member of the Libra Association, the entity formed by Facebook that will eventually be responsible for running the nodes of the Libra blockchain network. If (or when) Libra is successfully launched, Facebook intends for Libra to serve as a global financial network that will bank the unbanked and be used as a means to easily send payments across borders.
Joe said that Bison Trails’ decision to become a part of the Libra association is “consistent with our approach for every blockchain protocol on the Bison Trails Platform.”
“Our goal is to ensure the Libra network is decentralized, secure, and well-orchestrated, with the infrastructure in place to support billions of transactions,” he told Finance Magnates.
Joe also explained that the decision to participate in Libra stems from the alignment of the two entities’ values: “the Libra network is designed to be transparent by default. It represents a major leap forward towards a financially inclusive world. This aligns well with our vision of democratizing access to the decentralized future.”
“At Bison Trails, we want to see the entire blockchain ecosystem flourish. The scale of the Libra network vision is ambitious,” Joe said. “We anticipate this launch moving the world much closer to the mass adoption of cryptocurrency, potentially triggering a global inflection point towards decentralization.”
Even if Libra ultimately doesn’t launch, Joe said that the company is eager to involve itself with projects that have similar goals and similar scales: “we’d be thrilled to be a part of similar initiatives and a few upcoming ones in the works already,” he told Finance Magnates.

Beyond its involvement in Libra or similar potential involvement in similar projects, Joe explained that “Bison Trails is on a mission to help grow the entire blockchain ecosystem, to democratize access and to enable the pioneers of tomorrow.”
Indeed, “Bison Trails’ goal is to enable pioneers to drive business and society forward while opening up new pathways for innovation,” Joe explained.
“By bringing transparency and ease to entrepreneurs bold enough to build in a decentralized ecosystem, investors wise enough to back a nascent market, and enterprises courageous enough to commit to a technological inevitability like blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, Bison Trails is enabling greater access and participation in the decentralized future.”
Joe said that he believes that “for blockchain technology to reach mainstream adoption, it needs to be abstracted away from the user experience so that mainstream users of these products don’t need to necessarily understand or directly interact with the blockchain itself.”
“Bison Trails is empowering entrepreneurs and companies to engage and build these better products and services on the blockchain using transformative technology, through our platform and services. By making this easier, more efficient, and more cost-effective, Bison Trails helps teams focus on improving their core experience and is helping build a future where blockchain is a mainstream technology.”
Recently, the firm raised $25.5 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Blockchain Capital; Joe explained that the money would be used to “help us continue to be the easiest and safest way to participate in a blockchain network securely through staking, voting, and validating.”
“We will be opening the platform out of limited beta to a wider market, and are excited to announce our new network roadmap which includes: NuCypher, Near, Libra, Telegram, Edgeware, Skale, Polkadot, Solana, Mobilecoin, Coda, Enigma, Ava, Ethereum 2.0, Celo, Keep, Filecoin, Dfinity, etc,” Joe continued.
“We are also excited to share that this funding will allow us to grow our team to meet market demand and pursue new opportunities which include building [and] announcing partnerships with leading exchanges and custodians.”
And what of the company’s competition within the space? Joe explained that there isn’t much concern–”we don’t have many real competitors from a technical perspective,” he said.
“Although there are several companies offering similar technology platforms, we believe our platform is the most robust when it comes to secure, scalable block-production and protocol participation infrastructure…We’re the only platform built with enterprise-grade key management solutions.”
Where does Joe see the company in five years?
“In any space with emerging technology, some innovations will succeed and find traction while other efforts will not,” he told Finance Magnates.
“While we can’t realistically predict which new protocols and initiatives will see mainstream adoption in 5 years, it’s safe to say we’ll remain true to our protocol-agnostic approach as a company.”
“We envision a future in which Bison Trails’ technology and services support the entire ecosystem’s growth, democratizing access to the decentralized future and enabling pioneers from the United States and around the world to build on the blockchain securely.”
As for the year ahead, Joe said that the company would be focusing on “opening the platform, out of a limited beta, to a wider market,” as well as “actively working with founding members [of the Libra Association] to move the technology forward, from testnet to mainnet launch.” Bison Trails will also be working on building its internal team and creating new partnerships.
The company’s “new network roadmap” includes NuCypher, Near, Libra, Telegram, Edgeware, Skale, Polkadot, Solana, Mobilecoin, Coda, Enigma, Ava, Ethereum 2.0, Celo, Keep, Filecoin, Dfinity, Tupelo, and others.

    <h5 class="mb-1">South Korea to Impose Capital Gains Tax on Crypto</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Properly taxing earnings from crypto is a major debate topic all over the world; however, the South Korean government has finally found a way.
The South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to impose capital gains tax on digital currencies, The Korea Times reported on Sunday.
Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo
Per the sources of the local publication, the ministry is aiming to prepare the first draft of the bill by the first half of next year.
“Related discussions have been taking place […] The revised bill will be drawn up by the first half of next year,” an anonymous official from the ministry told the publication.
#FBS2020: FBS Gives Away Lucky Gift Boxes in A New Year PromoGo to article >>
However, the report also outlined that the government will not rely on the approval of the upcoming bill – it is prepared to levy capital gains tax on incomes from digital currencies anyway. The government, however, should put a clear definition of cryptocurrency.
Moreover, it is also not clear whether the government is planning to implement the gains tax similar to profits from stock trading or real estate transactions.
The South Korean government is already collecting trading data from the crypto exchanges operating in the country, which is essential to impose a tax on such incomes.
Several other countries are also considering to impose similar taxation on crypto earnings. Last month, Ukraine proposed a similar bill for crypto gains tax. If passed, the nationals need to pay a five percent tax on crypto for the first five years, and afterward, the government will levy the standard 18 percent tax.
Meanwhile, several other crypto-related bills are pending with the South Korean Assembly for approval. The government is also determined to strengthen know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules and proposed an act to mandate banks to issue only real-name accounts to crypto exchanges.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China's Massive Microsoft Gut-Punch Won't Hurt MSFT Bull Run</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over the next three years, offices of public institutions and government agencies in China have to replace foreign software and equipment. That means, no more Microsoft for public offices by 2022.
The abrupt decision of the government of China to essentially ban the usage of American software and computer equipment companies for state-funded offices moves in line with the Made in China 2025 initiative issued by Premier Li Keqiang in 2015.
Four years ago, China established an ambitious vision to move away from manufacturing cheap goods to higher-value products. It focuses on sectors like automotive, aerospace, IT, and robotics, which China has struggled to dominate in recent years.
The move to eliminate China’s dependence on tech giants like Microsoft, Dell, and HP indicates that the government will position itself to fuel most of the country’s IT-related operations with local technologies.
Last month, at the East Tech West conference in China, Alain Crozier, Microsoft’s CEO for the Greater China region, told CNBC that the main source of revenue for the company in China is helping Chinese companies expand into overseas markets.
He said:
Hence, Microsoft does not really target Chinese consumers based in China as its priority market but rather Chinese companies that are looking to serve overseas consumers and users.
More importantly, Crozier noted that the company tries to focus on things it can control, hinting that the trade war and other geopolitical risks are unlikely to affect the firm to a large extent.
He said:
Microsoft has also been looking to move production out of China since July amidst ongoing trade disputes.
China already previously banned Windows 8 for security concerns in 2014, surprising Microsoft. At the time, a Microsoft spokesperson said that it would work proactively with government agencies to ensure their products meet the requirements.
The spokesperson stated:
As such, China’s concern regarding potential security issues with foreign software are not something new, and it dates back to almost five years ago.
The removal of foreign software from public offices in itself is unlikely to have any major impact on Microsoft and its business in China.
The vast majority of Huawei laptops run on Windows and beginning on November 29, Microsoft is allowed to sell software to the Chinese tech conglomerate again.
However, it could pose a long-term to the expansion of Microsoft in the growing Chinese market.
Still, with Microsoft being up more than 49% year-to-date, it will need more than this to affect its bull run.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Luno Planning To Add Ripple To Its List By Early 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Luno, the cryptocurrency exchange, seems to be making waves of late. Less than a month after it officially announced its comeback in Malaysia and plans to expand its cryptocurrency list, the company recently announced that it was planning on making Ripple (XRP) one of the first alternative coins (altcoins) available on the exchange.
According to an exclusive interview with The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), Ripple has already been approved by the Securities Commission (SC), and that Luno will be bringing the cryptocurrency onboard the exchange sometime during the beginning of 2020.
According to Vijay Ayyar, Head of Luno in Asia, the digital currency is still not yet listed on Luno, but that is a possibility that the company is exploring. At this point, the company’s main priority was retaining customer safety and compliance with regulations. Ayyar also told TMR that the adoption of Ripple could roll the cryptocurrency market further along.
XRP was created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based currency exchanged that was founded in 2012. After Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has the third-largest market capitalisation of US$9.2 billion (~RM38.3 billion).

    <h5 class="mb-1">How global cities are promoting sustainability and helping to fight climate change - CityAM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2016 Paris Agreement gave the world a sense of hope that politicians could work together to limit temperature rises to 2 degrees centigrade. However, much has changed since the milestone agreement. More frequent extreme weather events, increasing political nationalism and growing economic inequality are making the goal of a carbon neutral world by 2050 harder to achieve. Schroders’ Climate Progress Dashboard is currently indicating that global temperatures are likely to rise by 3.8 degrees by 2025
As investors in global cities, we seek to ensure that each holding is analysed on its sustainability credentials during the investment process, including its impact on the environment. On a recent visit to Paris we learnt more about how the publicly listed French commercial and residential landlord Gecina is demonstrating leadership in the transition to a more sustainable city. Paris is ranked 17th in our Global Cities Index and 90 per cent of Gecina’s portfolio is located within the Paris region (as of the end of 2018). Their ambition to own sustainable urban assets is a key reason for our interest in the company.
With control over local planning, taxes and energy supply, the mayors of leading global cities are setting ambitious climate action plans to meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement. Paris has its own climate agency to deliver theirs and sits on the steering committee of the C40 Cities group that is sharing sustainability best practice globally.
Local real estate owners will play an important role in achieving these plans, as buildings and the construction industry account for around 40 per cent of global carbon emissions.
Ambitions are agreed at executive level and structured around the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Getting these targets approved by third parties, such as the Carbon Trust and Science Based Targets initiative, adds validity to this process.
Gecina has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and has cut its emissions by 32 per cent since 2008, half way to its 2030 target.
2. Using renewable energy
Energy consumption is a key contributor to overall carbon emissions from buildings, with around 80 per cent still supplied by fossil fuels globally.
Gecina recently developed an office building called “Be Issy”, which produces more energy than it consumes using 960 square metres of photo-voltaic cells and geothermal heat pumps. However, sufficient renewable energy cannot be generated on site in all cases. Much rests on tenants once buildings are occupied, with “green leases” one way to incentivise good practice.
Cities such as Paris are also introducing district urban heat and cooling networks that can improve energy efficiency by 50 per cent. With occupiers seeking to achieve their own sustainability goals, developers hope that such innovations will strengthen tenant demand and landlord pricing power.
3. Reducing embodied carbon in the development process
The vast majority of emissions come from inefficient older buildings. One of Gecina’s most ambitious projects to date is the redevelopment and consolidation of two former office buildings on Rue De Courcelles, also targeting a carbon neutral design. This includes using wood in the structure to store carbon (and reduce concrete emission intensity), a greenhouse on the roof and renewable energy production.
4. Reducing waste and recycling old materials
Landlords are seeking to avoid sending waste to landfill by integrating so-called circular economy design principles into their projects. This involves reusing existing property, plant and equipment. For example, two-thirds of the existing marble façade at Gecina’s other major redevelopment – L1ve – is to be reused as flooring in the new building entrance, saving money and cutting waste.
5. Providing access to low emission transport
Locating new developments near major transport hubs promotes sustainable travel and cuts indirect portfolio carbon emissions. Developers are also increasingly including electric vehicle charging stations in their developments as global cities prepare for a future free of petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.
6. Reintroducing biodiversity and green space
Maintaining existing and integrating new green spaces helps to sustain biodiversity and remove carbon from the atmosphere. Gecina’s L1ve office redevelopment will include 2,800 square metres of gardens and terraces within the building’s footprint.
7. Accessing sustainable financing
Green bonds are subject to reporting on environmental and social obligations, with the funds often used to invest in sustainable properties and projects. This new source of capital is growing rapidly. Gecina has structured 20 per cent of its borrowing as “sustainable improvement loans”.
8. Certifying buildings to “grade A” standards
Financial conditions for Gecina’s sustainable loans are indexed against the group’s corporate social responsibility performance. This includes certifications such as GRESB, which provides ESG benchmarking for real assets. Building certification gives investors, lenders and occupiers confidence that developers’ ambitions around building standards can be achieved. Tracking these standards across a portfolio can demonstrate improvements in energy efficiency, health and well-being, accessibility, connectivity and biodiversity. These attributes are also becoming increasingly important to occupiers seeking happy and productive staff.
Gecina is demonstrating global leadership in its transition to a more sustainable real estate portfolio, seeking to contribute to the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. A more environmentally friendly portfolio should benefit from reduced operating costs, better access to capital and stronger tenant demand, thereby also creating an inherently more sustainable business model. We believe this transition is therefore not only the right thing to do from a social perspective, but also makes financial sense for investors.
Gecina is one of the core holdings in the Global Cities Real Estate Fund (as of October 2019) and is used above for illustrative purposes of how a sustainable portfolio can be achieved.

Global Cities Fund – Risk Considerations
Changes in China’s political, legal, economic or tax policies could cause losses or higher costs for the fund. The counterparty to a derivative or other contractual agreement or synthetic financial product could become unable to honour its commitments to the fund, potentially creating a partial or total loss for the fund. The fund can be exposed to different currencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates could create losses. A derivative may not perform as expected, and may create losses greater than the cost of the derivative. Emerging markets, and especially frontier markets, generally carry greater political, legal, counterparty and operational risk.
Equity prices fluctuate daily, based on many factors including general, economic, industry or company news. The fund uses derivatives for leverage, which makes it more sensitive to certain market or interest rate movements and may cause above-average volatility and risk of loss.
In difficult market conditions, the fund may not be able to sell a security for full value or at all. This could affect performance and could cause the fund to defer or suspend redemptions of its shares.
Failures at service providers could lead to disruptions of fund operations or losses.

    <h5 class="mb-1">City regulator toughens up financial accountability rules after scandals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tougher accountability rules have today been extended to cover around 47,000 firms across the financial sector, as the financial watchdog seeks to clean up the City’s reputation following a string of scandals. 
The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) holds firms’ senior managers directly accountable for their actions, and is intended to help regulators punish the right people quickly for failures on their watch.

The new regulation, which was initially introduced to cover banks and insurers three years ago, is today being rolled out to cover all asset managers, independent financial advisers and hedge fund managers regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
“SMCR fundamentally swings the pendulum of personal accountability for wrongdoing from the trading floor to the boardroom,” said Quinn Perrot, co-founder of regulation-focused fintech Traction.
The introduction of the tougher rules come at the end of a year during which regulators have trained their sights on the fund industry following scandals including the collapse of Neil Woodford’s investment empire. 
Concerns were raised when SMCR was introduced in 2016 that the rules would make it harder to find staff willing to take on the additional responsibility, but legal experts generally view the enforcement of the regime by the FCA and Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Regulation Authority division as negligible. 
DLA Piper partner Michael McKee said the implementation of SMCR “will not seem like a step change at first” for many firms.

“However, the challenges associated with the SMCR come from the change in supervisory expectations on boards and senior managers and in the impact of enforcement action – when this is taken,” he added. “
These changes will flow through later – in the second half of 2020 and beyond.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Late payments: Firms wait twice as long for cash in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK’s small and medium-sized businesses are being stretched by customers failing to pay them on time, according to a survey from business body Market Finance.
Firms had to wait an average of 23 days to receive their money in 2019, the survey found, up from 12 days in 2018.

Industry groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have decried what they term the late payment crisis, which they say is hurting small businesses at an already challenging time.
Market Finance found that the professional and legal services sector suffered with late payment the most in 2019. Seven in ten invoices were paid late, up from 30 per cent in 2018.
Six in ten manufacturing invoices were paid late, while 50 per cent of retailers had to wait for their money.
Late payment practices improved for companies working in the utilities and energy sector with only a third of invoices being paid late in 2019 compared to two-thirds in 2018.
There was a marginal improvement in the number of invoices paid on time, however, with 39 per cent of invoices paid late in 2019, up from 43 per cent in 2018.
Bilal Mahmood, external relations director at Market Finance, said: “It’s great to see that fewer invoices were paid late in 2019 but worryingly, those that were paid late took twice as long.”

He added: “Late payment practices harm business cash flow, hampers investment and, in extreme cases, can risk business solvency.”
Mahmood said watchdogs “need more bite” so they can better crack down on late payments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. Dollar Czar: “No Need” for Fed Issuing Digital Dollar in Next 5 Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TwitterFacebookWhatsAppGoogle+BufferLinkedIn
In recent weeks, there has been growing talk among influential U.S. figures concerning the prospects of “digitizing” the dollar via blockchain technology.
Yet there are two major American officials who have once again said they are decidedly skeptical of a digital dollar any time soon:  Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
That’s per comments made this week to the U.S. Congress by Sec. Mnuchin, who testified on Thursday before the House of Representative’s Financial Services Committee regarding the topic of America’s financial stability. Therein, Mnuchin — President Trump’s foremost economic adviser — said he and Chairman Powell, the current head of the U.S. central banking system, were of the same opinion that a Fed-backed blockchain dollar wasn’t near.
“[Fed Chairman] Powell and I have discussed this at length: we both agree that in the near future, in the next five years, we see no need for the Fed to issue a digital currency,” Mnuchin said.
It’s not exactly a surprising position. This year, Sec. Mnuchin has made it clear that he’s generally skeptical toward the cryptocurrency space. Back in July, Mnuchin declared “I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin.” Around the same time, he said U.S. regulatory agencies were coordinating on cryptocurrencies to foster a “unified approach.”
Moreover, Sec. Mnuchin’s latest digital dollar comments come on the heels of the U.S. Treasury releasing its “2019 Annual Report,” wherein his department concluded that stablecoins could have major impacts on America’s economy if they were ever to become “widely adopted as a means of payment.”
For his part, Fed Chairman Powell told Congress last month that the Fed was considering a central bank digital currency but had yet to actively start developing one:
“[T]he Federal Reserve is not currently developing a U.S. dollar central bank digital currency … but continues to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of issuing a general purpose CBDC, defined as a new type of Federal Reserve liability that could be held directly by households or businesses,” Powell said.
Notably, the chatter comes after former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo argued in October that America should transition the dollar onto blockchain technology. Just this week, Giancarlo joined the Willkie Farr & Gallagher law firm, where he said he would continue working to back a digital dollar.
In his aforementioned congressional hearing, Sec. Mnuchin also touched on Facebook’s Libra stablecoin project, which has caught the ire of regulators around the world since June.
While financial authorities in France and Germany have said they intend to block the Libra altogether from coming to Europe, Sec. Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee that he would be agreeable to Libra moving forward in the U.S. so long as its backers followed all of the required finance laws.
“I’m fine if Facebook wants to get into digital payments … and that may be good for their customer base and good for a lot of Americans who don’t have access to banks … we want to make sure if they do it they’re doing it in a way that is fully compliant,” Mnuchin said.
American may not be close to releasing a digital dollar, though other countries are nearing their own digital currencies.
This week, the Bank of France said it would undertake trials around a digital euro in 2020. That announcement is only the latest of its kind, as nations like China and Turkey are already well along in rapidly developing their own digital currencies.
If the U.S. waits much longer, it’ll left behind in the dust where digital money is concerned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">National e-commerce policy to lay down terms for treatment of non-personal, commercial data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The new e-commerce policy being drafted by the government is likely to lay down how non-personal data such as commercial data held by e-commerce companies, anonymised data and community data are to be treated in terms of their location and processing.
“We have started stakeholder consultations on how to treat non-personal data. It is a highly sensitive matter as different stakeholders have different views on it. For instance, Nasscom has its set of opinions, while industry body CII has its own views. There are also various studies done on the subject. All these will be examined one by one," Guruprasad Mohapatra, Secretary, Department of Policy for Industry and Internal Trade told BusinessLine.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), while working on the Personal Data Bill, had made a separate committee comprising IT experts and officials from key Ministries to look at whether there should be a free flow of non-personal and anonymised data across borders or it should be localised.
While the Personal Data Bill 2018 was recently cleared by the Union Cabinet and will soon be placed before Parliament, a number of loose ends still need to be tied for non-personal data.
“We will try to see that the e-commerce policy is finalised soon. This (treatment of non-personal data) is the only sensitivity which has to be worked out,” Mohapatra said.
Multinational corporations such as Amazon, Uber and Google hold a lot of anonymised data in India that are commercial in nature and most want to store the data outside the country and also process it there. The US government, too, has been lobbying hard with India for a free flow of data.
Many in the domestic industry, however, argue that localising data will not only ensure absolute security of data but also create jobs within the country as domestic servers have to be used for storing it.
As per the draft Personal Data Protection Bill approved by the Cabinet, personal data classified as sensitive such as information on financial matters, sexual orientation, health, biometrics, genetics, transgender status and religious or political beliefs and affiliation cannot be stored by public and private entities outside the country but can be processed outside with the consent of the data person.
Critical personal data, to be defined from time to time by the government but mostly related to security and defence matters, will have to be mandatorily processed and stored in the country. However, general data, which will fall outside the purview of sensitive and critical, can be both processed and stored outside the country.
In June this year, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said that an institutional framework would be put in place to bring out a national e-commerce policy within twelve months. He also said that India wanted to engage with the world on data and e-commerce issues, but there has to be reciprocity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Age Beverages Stock Remains a High-Risk, High-Reward Situation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in late September, I wrote here that small-cap beverage company New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) looked like a potential multi-bagger. But, I also cautioned that four big risks could challenge that multi-bagger thesis. Ultimately, I labeled NBEV stock as a high-risk, high-reward investment.
Fast forward two months. The “high-risk” part has won out so far. NBEV stock has lost about 30% of its value.The culprit? Mixed third quarter numbers. While New Age Beverages did show off huge revenue growth in the quarter, expenses grew by much more than sales. Yet again, the company wasn’t profitable, and this lack of profitability is starting to concern investors in a big way.
After considering the third quarter print, I’ve slightly changed my thesis on NBEV stock. Before, I saw NBEV stock as a high-risk, high-reward investment, where the reward part outweighed the risk part. Now, profitability concerns have made me less optimistic. I see NBEV stock as a high-risk, high-reward investment, where the potential risks and rewards offset one another.
Sure, NBEV stock could still be a multi-bagger. But now I have less conviction in that happening any time soon than I did two months ago.
Zooming out, New Age Beverages stock still has multi-bagger potential, despite its late 2019 sell-off.
The core ideas behind the multi-bagger bull thesis are simple. New Age Beverages has a very relevant product portfolio, comprised of health-oriented and organic beverages that consumers are increasingly demanding today as they become more health-conscious and eco-friendly. At the same time, that very relevant product portfolio is finally gaining national distribution, as the company has landed big partnerships with the likes of Circle K, 7-Eleven and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). This dynamic alone — relevant products gaining more distribution — should power healthy revenue growth at New Age Beverages for the next few years.
On top of all that, New Age Beverages also has a CBD catalyst, as the company is in the early stages of rolling out CBD-infused beverages in multiple international markets. This catalyst is a wild-card. But, if New Age does successfully turn into a relevant player in the CBD beverage market, then that will undoubtedly add big growth to the top-line.
Big picture — New Age Beverages has multiple catalysts on the horizon, the sum of which should power healthy revenue growth over the next few years. All management needs to do in order to generate sizable profits, then, is sustain 60%-plus gross margins (they are already there) and manage expenses lower.
If they do that, this company could produce 75 cents in EPS by fiscal 2025. Based on a consumer discretionary average 20-times forward multiple, that implies a 2024 price target for NBEV stock of $15 — more than seven-fold the current price tag.
Although the multi-bagger thesis for NBEV stock remains alive, the risks surrounding this stock are more apparent than ever before.
The biggest risk for New Age Beverages is profitability, or lack thereof. Sure, the company is growing sales by leaps and bounds today (basically 400%-plus revenue growth all year long). But, that big growth is being driven by even bigger expense growth (700%-plus operating expense growth all year long). This is nothing new for New Age Beverages. In both 2017 and 2018, expense increases also dramatically outpaced revenue growth.
This dynamic makes complete sense if you consider the competitive landscape in which New Age operates. The beverage market is a very tough one, with fickle demand and very little customer loyalty. Sure, New Age’s beverage portfolio has huge upside potential given its composition. But, the drinks still may not stand out in the crowded functional drink market. If they don’t stand out, New Age Beverages will have to spend more to get them to stand out. That’s exactly what has been going on. New Age’s drinks are standing out, but largely because the beverage maker is paying up for them to stand out.
The competitive dynamic in this segment of the fast-moving CPG brands won’t change anytime soon. Thus, it’s unlikely that New Age’s problem of having to spend big to grow big will change anytime soon, either. Instead, what’s far more likely is that New Age’s expenses continue to run higher alongside revenues.
That’s a problem. Gross margins are above 60%, which is already high for a soft beverage company (average gross margins in the industry are 56%). So, there’s not much more firepower on the gross margin expansion front. Yet, the company is still unprofitable today. So, in order to drive a profit, New Age needs positive operating leverage.
That positive operating leverage may be hard to come by. If so, then NBEV stock will remain weak.
NBEV stock remains a high-risk, high-reward investment, where the potential risks are rising and the potential rewards are becoming less visible. Yes, shares could rise seven-fold in the long run. But, the likelihood of that happening is becoming smaller and smaller as profitability issues become more and more glaring.
So long as these profitability issues hang around, NBEV stock will remain lower for longer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GE Stock is a Buy as CEO Larry Culp Addresses the Mess He Inherited</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Larry Culp deserves credit for breathing new life into the GE stock price, which has surged more than 50% since January. The stock has more room to run in 2020 as Culp cleans up the mess left by his predecessors.
During the most recent quarter, GE announced or completed more than $9 billion in “Industrial delevering actions” along with changes to its U.S. pension benefits that the company estimates will reduce the firm’s Industrial net debt by between $4 billion to $6 billion. 
The company received $3 billion in net cash proceeds during the latest quarter as it continues to sell its stake in its oil/gas joint venture with Baker Hughes. It also netted $1.6 billion from unloading its stake in Wabtec (NYSE:WAB). GE’s Railroad business merged with Wabtec, formerly known as Westinghouse, last year. Next up, Culp and his team expect to close the $21 billion sales of its life sciences business to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) early in 2020.
Though GE’s finances are still an expensive hot mess, there are some reasons for optimism, although the company’s various businesses are not firing on all cylinders. GE stock currently trades at about $11.10 about an 6% discount to Wall Street analysts’ median 52-week target of $11.75, according to CNN. Yahoo Finance shows the consensus at $10.55. The company’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is 16.2x, under the average S&P 500 index multiple of 19x.
GE’s Power business, which for years was a cash cow, lost $144 million in the most recent quarter, an improvement from a $676 million loss a year earlier. Revenue for the business fell 14% to $3.93 billion amid a slump in orders for gas turbines. Though General Electric’s Renewable Energy division continues to hum along nicely, it is much smaller than the conventional power business.
Revenue at Renewable Energy rose 13% to $4.25 billion. Orders surged 30% to $5.02 billion, fueled by strong demand for Wind Energy turbines. Though GE reported a $98 million loss in the quarter, that was due to increased spending on research and development. As climate change becomes a growing concern, GE stands to benefit from the increasing demand for offshore wind capacity, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 25% through 2024, according to Global Industry Analysis.
Boeing’s grounding of the 737 Max is hurting the company’s Aviation business. Even so, the division is holding up. Revenue rose 8% to $8.1 billion, while segment profit jumped 3% $1.3 billion. However, the economic outlook for airlines can turn on a dime. According to the International Air Transport Association, the worldwide airline fleet is expected to increase by more than 1,000 aircraft to 30,000 by the end of 2020, though the outlook has worsened, and uncertainty has grown.
GE Capital reported a loss of $663 million thanks to a $1 billion charge after the company took its Annual Insurance U.S. GAAP premium deficiency test. Excluding this one-time item, adjusted earnings rose to $123 million due to lower impairments and lower excess interest costs. The business, which has been “de-levering” its balance sheet, ended the quarter with $121 million of assets, including $11.8 billion in liquidity.
GE’s Healthcare business is another question mark; The biopharma business GE is selling to Danaher is the division’s fastest-growing. Otherwise, Healthcare’s performance is okay but not great. Revenue during the most recent quarter revenue rose 5% to $4.92 billion while profit jumped 13% to $974 billion. However, that increase was driven by “volume and cost productivity, partially offset by inflation, tariffs, and program investments.”
Larry Culp is assembling a new team to take the venerable General Electric back and beyond to its glory days. GE stock holders may have been disappointed with the decision late last week to keep the dividend at a penny — “why bother,” many asked — but the new CEO is running a marathon, not a sprint.
When Culp came in to the job a little more than a year ago, pundits were quick to rattle off the litany of items on his to-do list, a list that was really made up of things his predecessors failed to-do, shouldn’t have done or simply, didn’t do right. They were also happy to point out what Culp stands to make if he and his team gets things right.
General Electric stock investors, willing to get on board for the long term, are beginning to grasp what their take could be if those things happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crypto Payments Now Legal in Ukraine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lawmakers in Ukraine have adopted new legislation that legalizes crypto payments as the country moves forward with strict compliance to international anti-money laundering (AML) standards.
According to Forklog, members of the Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine’s legislative arm, have adopted a new bill that incorporates international AML best practices into the country’s crypto regulatory framework.
As part of the newly adopted legislation, cryptos are now classified as property in Ukraine. Thus, virtual currency owners can use their digital holdings as a medium of exchange allowing room for legalized trading, payments, investments, and transfers.
Details of the new law also include a provision for private individuals to act as crypto money transmitters and custodians. Such services must, however, operate in strict compliance with financial monitoring and reporting standards prescribed by the newly adopted bill.
The news of the legalization of cryptoasset payments comes on the heels of an announcement by the country’s Ministry of Digital Transformation of its partnership with a Belarusian crypto exchange. As reported by Bitcoinist, the move aims to learn from the Belarusian experience in creating a legal framework for payments and virtual currency adoption in general.
By legalizing crypto payments, Ukraine appears to have taken a significant step in boosting local virtual currency commerce in the country. Earlier in the year, the city of Kyiv announced that it was considering allowing bitcoin payments in its public transport system.
By adopting the new regulatory standards for crypto payments, Ukraine is also complying with the guidelines introduced by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Since the start of 2019, the FATF has been keen on directing member nations to enact more stringent regulatory provisions.
The main focus for the FATF concerning crypto has been compliance with AML regulations. Several crypto exchanges have been forced to comply with FATF ‘Travel Rule.’
In preparing the bill, Ukrainian lawmakers reportedly collaborated with European Union (EU)-funded crypto experts. Ukraine’s government will also be hoping that the adoption of the new laws will aid its quest in securing up to €500 million in financial assistance from the (EU).
Since assuming office, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has adopted a positive stance towards digital and blockchain technology. Reports indicate that the Zelensky administration sees blockchain adoption as a path towards fighting systemic corruption in the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USD/CHF starts new week quiet around 0.9900</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite a 30-pip rebound fueled by the broad-based USD strength on Friday, the USD/CHF pair erased 100 pips for the week and is now staying flat on the day near 0.9900.
The data from the US on Friday revealed that Nonfarm Payrolls in November increased by 266,000 to bear the market expectation of 180,000 and helped the greenback outperform its rivals. The US Dollar Index, which posted losses for five straight days, added 0.3% on Friday to help the pair pull away from its lows. 
Nevertheless, investors seem to be refraining from taking large positions ahead of this week's key events that could potentially impact the market sentiment and the USD's valuation.
The US and China will try to finalize the phase-one of the trade deal before the planned tariff hike goes into effect on December 15th and the Federal Open Market Committee will announce the monetary policy decisions on Wednesday following the two-day meeting that will kick off on Tuesday.
Previewing the FOMC event, "barring unfavourable developments on the trade front in the coming days, we doubt the Fed 2020 central tendency GDP growth projection will be significantly altered, allowing the FOMC to remain “watchfully waiting” as Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester put it," said analysts at National Bank Financial. "Our base case scenario remains for the target range to be left unchanged at 1.50 to 1.75%.”
Confirming the neutral mood on Monday, major European equity indexes are posting small daily losses while the S&P 500 futures remain flat on the day. Furthermore, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield is staying calm near last week's closing level of 1.81%.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to analysts at National Bank Financial, the highlight of the week will be the central bank’s monetary policy meeting in the US.
“Heading into their communication blackout period, the message from Fed spokespersons was that both the economy and the target range for the fed funds rate were in a good place. This situation has not changed much judging from the findings of the latest Beige Book. The latter suggested that the U.S. economy as a whole continued to expand modestly from October through mid-November, an impression reinforced by recent purchasing manager surveys.”
“As such, barring unfavourable developments on the trade front in the coming days, we doubt the Fed 2020 central tendency GDP growth projection will be significantly altered, allowing the FOMC to remain “watchfully waiting” as Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester put it. Our base case scenario remains for the target range to be left unchanged at 1.50 to 1.75%.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NZD/USD consolidates last week's gains, trades above mid-0.65s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NZD/USD pair registered one of its largest weekly percentage gains last week as it added more than 140 pips to close at 0.6563. However, with investors moving to the sidelines ahead of this week's key events, the pair struggled to preserve its momentum and was last seen posting small daily gains at 0.6557.
The data published from China on Sunday revealed that the Trade Surplus narrowed to $38.73 billion in November from $42.81 billion amid a 1.1% slump in annual exports but was largely ignored at the start of the week. On the other hand, Statistics New Zealand reported that Manufacturing Sales declined by 0.3% in the third quarter to beat the market expectation of -0.8%.
In the meantime, on the back of the upbeat Nonfarm Payrolls data on Friday, the US Dollar Index snapped its five-day losing streak and finished the week on a strong note. Later this week, the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) monetary policy announcements will be critical for the USD's market valuation.
Moreover, investors will be paying close attention to fresh developments surrounding the US-China trade dispute before the US hikes tariffs on Chinese imports on December 15th. Earlier in the day, China’s Assistant Commerce Minister noted that they were hoping to reach a trade agreement with the US as soon as possible. Trade-sensitive antipodeans could gain traction if sides sign the phase-one of the trade deal to avoid additional tariffs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gold clings to modest gains above $1460 level, lacks follow-through</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gold edged higher on the first day of a new trading week and recovered a part of Friday's post-NFP slide to multi-day lows.
The latest US monthly jobs report surpassed most optimistic estimates, which provided a goodish intraday lift to the US dollar and eventually prompted some aggressive selling around the dollar-denominated commodity.
However, persistent uncertainty over a potential phase one trade deal between the world's two largest economies extended some support to the precious metal's perceived safe-haven status and helped gain some traction on Monday.
It is worth mentioning that top White House Economic Adviser, Larry Kudlow confirmed on Friday that the December 15 deadline to impose new tariffs on around $156 billion worth Chinese products remains in place.
Kudlow also said that the US President Donald Trump is pleased with the progress in trade negotiations, which added to a flurry of recent conflicting trade signals and kept a lid on the optimism and weighed on investors' sentiment.
Adding to this, a pullback in the US Treasury bond yields, which kept the USD bulls on the defensive, further provided an additional boost to the non-yielding yellow metal, albeit the uptick seemed to lack any bullish conviction.
Moreover, investors might also be reluctant to place any aggressive bets ahead of the upcoming event risk, the latest FOMC monetary policy update, which might further contribute towards capping any runaway rally.
Hence, it will be prudent to wait for some strong follow-through buying before positioning for any further intraday appreciating move amid absent relevant market moving economic releases from the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WTI drops 1% towards $ 58.50 amid trade tensions, weak China exports</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WTI (oil futures on NYMEX) is down over $1 from three-month highs of 59.85 reached last Friday after the OPEC and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to deepen their output cuts from 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.7 million bpd until March 2020.
Further, the black gold also derived support from the US oilfield services company, Baker Hughes, data that showed the US Rigs Count fell for the seventh consecutive week to 661, the lowest since April 2017.
However, on Monday, the barrel of WTI corrected after concerns over the Chinese economic situation resurfaced, in the face of a sharp drop in the country’s exports. The weak data highlights the negative impact the US-China trade war is having on the economy.
Meanwhile, markets trade with caution amid looming US tariffs hike on balance of Chinese imports, keeping the higher-yielding oil under pressure. The tariffs hike is effective from this Sunday.
Attention now turns towards the US weekly Crude Stocks data for fresh trading impetus ahead of the FOMC rate decision while trade-related headlined will continue to remain the main market driver.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China's Pig Herd Rises for First Time in a Year in November</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING, Dec 9 (Reuters) - China's pig herd increased by 2% in November compared with the prior month, the agriculture ministry said on Monday, the first increase in a year.
Sow stocks were up 4% on October, said the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on its website, the second consecutive month of a rise in the breeding herd inventory.
The closely watched data comes after an epidemic of African swine fever devastated the world's top hog herd, reducing it by 41% year on year by October.
While some analysts have described official numbers as conservative, the ministry figures would still equate to a decline of around 175 million pigs in the national herd.
Dutch firm Rabobank has estimated the herd will be 55% smaller by the end of this year, while others in the industry believe it could be even smaller.
Pork prices have surged to record levels, pushing consumer inflation in China to the highest level in almost eight years, and putting Beijing under growing pressure to ensure supplies ahead of important upcoming holidays.
Recent policies to stabilise production and support the recovery of the pig herd have begun to show results however, said Yang Zhenhai, director of the ministry's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau in the statement.
Ministry data also showed that production of pigs in large-scale farms, or those slaughtering more than 5,000 head a year, increased by 1.9% in November compared with October, while their sow stocks were up 6.1% month on month.
Yang said however that supplies will be tight ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday in late January, after the supply of hogs fell sharply between June and August this year.
Higher imports and the release of frozen pork from state reserves and commercial warehouses should boost supply however, while high prices will curb consumption.
"The overall supply and demand situation may be better than expected," Yang said in the statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UPDATE 1-EU sets tariffs on Indonesia biodiesel imports over subsidies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Adds details of case)
By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The European Union confirmed on Monday that it will impose tariffs on imports of biodiesel from Indonesia to counter what it sees as unfair subsidies, concluding a case that has lasted seven years.
The duties, normally in place for five years, have been set at between 8 and 18%, the same level as the provisional rates proposed in August.
Confirmation of the duties are another blow to Indonesian biodiesel producers after the EU said in March that palm oil should be phased out of renewable transport fuels due to palm plantations' contribution to deforestation.
The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the EU, has said its investigation found Indonesian biodiesel producers benefit from grants, tax benefits and access to raw materials below market prices.
The EU biodiesel market is worth an estimated 9 billion euros ($10 billion) a year, with imports from Indonesia worth about 400 million euros, the Commission said. Indonesian producers, it said, sold at unfairly low prices, driving EU producers into losses.
The EU and China are Indonesia's biggest markets for its biodiesel exports.
Indonesia has threatened to impose its own tariffs on EU dairy products.
The European Union also has imposed anti-subsidy duties on Argentine biodiesel producers, although it has tariff-free access for about 1.2 million tonnes as long as they sell no lower than a set minimum price.
The EU began looking into biodiesel from both major producers in 2012 and imposed anti-dumping duties on companies in 2013. However, the firms subsequently won challenges at the European Court of Justice and the World Trade Organization.
This prompted the EU to remove duties on most biodiesel imports from the two countries, but the Commission also started an investigation into possible unfair subsidies. (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Susan Fenton)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Consumers and companies alike require high quality electronic equipment to support everyday lives and more of these devices are now wireless enabled, writes ROHDE & SCHWARZ.
Technology is expected to support us in the office, homes, schools, hospitals and in our cars.  We expect connectivity everywhere and we expect it to work.  The importance of compatible operation among electronic devices and radios is critical to us as users and in the function of our businesses.  The growth of innovation is exponential and so is the expectation that devices will operate without fault or interference.
In addition, market surveillance authorities around the world are reviewing their activities as they come under more pressure to be stricter, with the aim to increase detection of products that fail to conform to rules on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and risk potential interference with other products or radio services.  The reasoning is clear: with more and more high-tech equipment in everyone’s cars and pockets, offices, and streets – and a society ever more reliant on their services to function safely and economically – it’s more important than ever that all these different devices can coexist harmoniously in close proximity to each other.
Moreover, market enthusiasm for wireless devices is putting increasing pressure on the available radio spectrum.  With the spread of the IoT, that pressure is expected to continue to rise.  It’s imperative that GSM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, Tetra, and other radios use the spectrum efficiently, with spectral awareness and minimum out-of-band emissions.  Coming over the horizon, new multi-radio equipped autonomous vehicles, home automation and the use of robotics will up the ante even more.
All electronic products must conform to international and national EMC and radio-equipment regulations.  Legislation is in force beyond the EU, including North American and Asian territories. Companies understand that technical compliance is only one part of the picture.  The associated administrative procedures and documentation that describes the tests that have been applied and supports the mandatory declarations of conformity must also be correct and kept up to date.
 
EMC Experts: In House and In the Community
EMC is an issue for companies’ engineering as well as compliance personnel.  Of course, each side has distinct goals and must rely on a different skillset and knowledge base to achieve them.
Engineers need a broad understanding of how to interpret and apply the technical regulations, and the techniques to use through design and testing to satisfy every applicable requirement.
Compliance personnel, for their part, must have a clear grasp of complex legislation and the numerous individual stipulations referenced by each standard.  Ensuring that declarations of conformity are correct and justified, and maintaining the documentation to support them, demands attention to detail and ongoing vigilance to maintain awareness as existing standards can be amended or replaced without notice.
Both groups can benefit from taking part in the growing community of EMC specialists active throughout the industry – from product design and marketing organisations, to contract test services, and test and measurement equipment suppliers.
 
Demystifying EMC
Returning for 2020, the 6th Demystifying EMC event will take place on Monday 10 February 2020 at the Silverstone Wing, in Northamptonshire. Presented by experts from a variety of organisations spanning the design, test and regulatory compliance spectrum, Demystifying EMC is established as one of the primary training events delivering high quality, free of charge training to the industry.  As with previous years, there will be five different tracks and sessions to choose from, and time in the day to network with peers, speak with industry experts and see demos.
On the day, Michael Derby of ACB Europe will explain more about how to get radio products approved, aided by Charlie Blackham of Sulis Consultants. They will discuss compliance issues concerning installing radio modules, EU RED and CE-Mark compliance, and how to satisfy FCC requirements when seeking acceptance in US markets.
Martin Wiles of Albatross Projects will look at the new CISPR EMC standards being finalised for radiated emissions measurements below 30 MHz using magnetic loops, and explore the feasibility of using and validating existing anechoic chambers under these conditions. This will be of particular interest to the automotive community, as well as other groups.  Tamara Monti of Dassault Systèmes will give insights into electric-drivetrain simulation, from the EMC standpoint, both at component and system level, and James Pawson of Unit 3 Compliance will provide a frank and down-to-“earth” perspective on ground issues.
Lee Hill of Silent Solutions will be back – giving the keynote titled ‘The five EMC things they didn’t put in your education’. He will also be presenting further presentations with practical applications and troubleshooting demonstrations throughout the day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Check out Forbes top five earning African American musicians in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Musicians are known for their contributions to the music industry and one would think with the release of Forbes world top earning musicians of 2019, their wealth would stem only from their music.
However, most of these top earning musicians have capitalised on their fame, success in the industry and their esteemed brands to venture into other businesses.
Forbes considers all other streams of income tied to the artiste to curate the list and mostly looks at earnings before tax and payments to lawyers, managers or agents.
“To determine our rankings, we consider income from touring, music and outside business ventures with the help of Pollstar, Nielsen Music and interviews with industry insiders including many of the stars themselves,” Forbes reports.
The top 10 highest paid musicians in the world this year earned a little over $1 billion as compared to $886 million from last year. The figures, according to Forbes, were calculated from June 2018 to June 2019.
This remarkable feat goes a long way in revealing how some of the most popular and most sought-after musicians are cashing in on the industry.
Here’s a list of the top five African American musicians who made it to the top 10.

The adjustment of P0.3044 per kWh will mean an increase of around P61 in the typical household’s total electricity bill.
Despite the adjustment, electricity rate this month is still around P0.70 per kWh lower than in April 2019.
From P5.0317 per kWh last month, the generation charge for December increased to P5.1967 per kWh, an upward adjustment of P0.1650 per kWh.
Charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) increased by P1.0799 per kWh driven by tighter supply conditions in the Luzon grid. As a result, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) placed the Luzon Grid on Yellow Alert on two occasions.  The average capacity on outage in November increased by 525 MW because of scheduled and forced outages of some power plants and the natural gas supply restriction of Malampaya onshore gas plant implemented by SPEX from November 10 to 14. The share of WESM to Meralco’s supply needs was reduced to 10%.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Around the world, ocean-impact accelerators are emerging as societies start to realise the importance of focusing efforts and investments towards healthier oceans.
Taking part in this exhilarating new movement, the OceanHub Africa launched their Ocean Innovation Africa event in Cape Town, supported by Wesgro, the South African French Embassy, the University of Cape Town and the V&A Waterfront.
Fifty carefully selected stakeholders from various backgrounds including entrepreneurs, researchers, investors, ocean business owners, non-profits and local authorities gathered to co-create the initiative’s roadmap in a bid to shape a future where both humans and oceans can thrive. 
OceanHub Africa is on a mission to inspire and support ocean-minded start-ups with the express aim of nurturing an environmentally conscious and profitable economy that effectively mitigates the effects of global warming as well as the overexploitation and pollution of the oceans.

Set to begin the programme early in the first quarter of 2020, OceanHub Africa will launch with the first cohort of six local start-ups. Leveraging its highly qualified network of stakeholders and facilitators it aims to deliver to the new initiatives the following services: 
OceanHub Africa is also offering a technology transfer support programme that promotes collaboration between researchers and entrepreneurs for science-based innovation.
By partnering with local universities, its objective is to find commercial use of scientific patents through the identification of transferable technologies and the incubation of selected projects.
This programme will strengthen the pipeline of ocean-minded start-ups and leverage the knowledge that lies within universities and research centres.
OceanHub Africa, currently hosted by South African venture fund and technology incubator, SAVANT Technologies, will inaugurate its Cape Town headquarters in February 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nedbank notches up 1.7m digitally active customers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nedbank has experienced accelerated adoption across its digital banking platforms, with a 30% growth rate from 2018.
After undertaking its digital transformation journey to address clients’ requirements, the big four bank says it now has 1.7 million digitally active customers, with its digital channels witnessing faster growth rates than walk-in branch services.
Mutsa Chironga, managing executive of consumer banking at Nedbank, told ITWeb the bank is constantly focused on improving its products and services across all channels, with additional services on the cards in the new year.
“Our digital transformation initiatives are premised on several pillars: cost efficiency, convenience, affordability and security, all focused on enhancing the customer service journey for our clients.
“We are seeing an increase in adoption of our digital banking platforms, with the Nedbank Money App currently having a user base of 871 000, while the mobile wallet-based account, MobiMoney, has signed up around 250 000 users.”
The number of payment transactions conducted on Nedbank’s digital platforms recently surpassed R37 billion, he adds.
The Nedbank Money App, launched in November 2017, was rated the number one app by users on Android and iOS, among the five major retail banks in SA. This, according to Chironga, is an indication that its users are experiencing higher satisfaction levels than users of other banking apps.
Last month, the Old Mutual-owned bank introduced Money App Lite, a more streamlined and lighter version of the Nedbank Money App, which is less data-intensive and uses less space on mobile devices.
Absa says it has 1.6 million digitally active users across all its digital platforms, with the Absa Banking App seeing a 26.7% year-on-year growth.
First National Bank (FNB) told ITWeb its banking app had over 2.8 million active users, last December, indicating a 12% increase on the 2.5 million active app users the bank had at the end of June 2018.
Overall, FNB has 8.2 million customers in SA, with around a third of those clients using the app. Financial transactions on the FNB app are growing by 52% year on year.
With a presence in seven Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa countries, Nedbank has continued its ongoing expansion through subsidiaries and banks in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, as well as representative offices in Angola and Kenya.
The bank is also harnessing the power of technology to enhance its sales strategy, notes Chironga.
“A big part of our digital strategy is to enable quick and easy digital sales, through the products and services offered via the app and the mobile wallet, including purchasing airtime, opening bank accounts, making loan applications and sending money to over 33 African countries through our partnership with Eco bank. We’ve recently added funeral insurance as a product offering and we are constantly adding different products and services.”
Through its partnership with software company, Hey Jude, Nedbank offers an array of services on its app aimed at supporting customers beyond banking services, including finance assist, medical-on-demand services and a digital personal assistant.
It was the first local bank to launch a scan-to-pay solution within its app, allowing customers to scan a Masterpass, Snapscan or Zapper QR code to make retail purchases and use utility services without their banking card.
In June, Nedbank announced a point of sale finance application partnership with Switch Pay that enables merchants to facilitate finance applications in-store, on behalf of their customers.
While the bank is continuously running educational campaigns to increase the number of users on its banking platforms, Chironga points out general challenges that often deter banking customers from using digital platforms are a complex on-boarding process, lack of education and high data costs.
“While there are different customer segments, with some being more digitally inclined than others, it’s clear that Nedbank is in the middle of a huge digital migration. Even though there may be many customers who are not utilising the digital channels today, that situation is changing very quickly, influenced by driving education and awareness initiatives.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blockchain, A Four-Time Waltz: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra & the CBDCs – The Need for a New Balance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We have deliberately chosen to limit our presentation, for pedagogical reasons, to the four fundamental periods represented by the emergence of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra and CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) because no other event (derived or similar project) has had such an impact on the global economy. Here, we present to the readers a possible configuration of the blockchain sector based on a four-part analysis, followed by a concluding proposal.
The Bitcoin blockchain was originally designed for a single purpose: to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer system for exchanging monetary value, freeing itself from third parties that are the financial institutions.
Admittedly, legally, Bitcoin in most countries is not considered as currency. The European Central Bank (ECB) thus consistently reminds us that the Euro is the only legal currency.
On an economic level, the debate continues to rage over the real status of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The discussion has become classic. Money fulfills three functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value (savings).   
We can argue indefinitely about whether these three criteria are present in the case of Bitcoin (and other global cryptocurrencies). It is true that more and more merchants accept Bitcoin (medium of exchange and unit of account), but it is also true that the “store of value” function has become predominant. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are subject to speculative movements (notably through trading platforms), bringing them closer to the nature of (risky) investments.
The Ethereum public blockchain was designed to provide a platform for decentralized applications. The purpose, therefore, being not mainly monetary but functional or “utilitarian”. The ether functions as an access token, allowing decentralized applications (called “smart contracts”) to be deployed and executed. This is how the notion of utility token was born.
In practice, the Ether has followed the fate of Bitcoin: an investment tool, and to a lesser extent a means of payment. The phenomenon of ICOs (initial coin offerings – fundraising by issuing tokens) has only accentuated this trend. Indeed, Ethereum’s only “killer app” to date has been the standardization of the ERC-20 token allowing the issuance and exchange of tokens as part of the ICO. These tokens have fed a secondary market, operating as (volatile) financial instruments.
Ethereum found itself trapped in a paradox: the ether, a token designed as a utility, is used to create effects equivalent to Bitcoin. 
This situation is explained by a cost model that is not adapted to the reality of the current economy: each transaction carried out on the network is measured in “gas” and remunerated in Ether, the price of which fluctuates, to the benefit of one or more nodes (machines participating in the network) acting in concert. It is as if users had to pay (and in a volatile currency) for certain terminals of a telephone network for a given call.
This intrinsic constraint de facto limits the economic viability of most decentralized applications.    
In addition, there is the well-known problem of network scalability.
As a consequence of this situation, economic actors have preferred to develop so-called private blockchains, which do not require “fee-for-service” payment, the cost of which is borne by all participants and which ensure real scalability. It must be noted that to date, the only real cases of industrial use are deployed on this type of blockchain.
Libra is precisely a perfect example of a private, or permission-based, blockchain that was designed to “provide the scale, stability and security necessary to support billions of people and transactions around the world”.
What makes it really unique compared to other private blockchains are the following two characteristics:
This equation is unprecedented; the application infrastructure dimension is a positive signal for the blockchain sector (and more generally for the players in the digital economy). As much, the monetary ambition displayed by Libra poses a major problem for States (and Central Banks), which fear being deprived of their monetary sovereignty. 
Of course, there are other stable cryptocurrencies, or “stablecoins”, all issued via a public blockchain (unlike Libra); none, however, has raised any real concerns, their effect being limited.
Libra is the first stablecoin with a global dimension and none of the existing legal instruments have provided a framework for such a scenario. Indeed, it is relatively easy to regulate current issuers of stablecoins, for example by subjecting them to the status of electronic money institutions (like Paypal).
FINMA (the Swiss financial regulator) has already stated that Libra should at least become a payment institution. But in reality, Libra, by its size, is intended to be more like a World Central Bank, and there is no regulation there. The case is completely new.
If we push the reasoning to the end, the worst nightmare for the United States would be to see the value of their national currencies defined by the Libra, because its adoption would far exceed that of the currencies represented in its reserve (notably the US Dollar and the Euro). 
The role of the Central Banks would be reduced until they become subservient to the Libra reserve!
Some Central Banks quickly reacted. Large countries, such as China, have announced the launch of a cryptocurrency issued by their Central Bank, while micro-States are already experimenting with a virtual currency, often correlated to the dollar.
From the point of view of States, the advantages of these cryptocurrencies are obvious: reduction of the costs of issuing currency, traceability of transactions and real-time control of the economy.
From the users’ point of view, CBDCs allow the emergence of a payment method that is both legal and interoperable with the “industry 4.0“. Fiduciary (FIAT) money is not “compatible” with decentralized applications (particularly financial) and new services such as AI and IoT, which will increasingly be operated via blockchains (examples: future shared autonomous cars or remote control of a 3D printer). 
Of course, the associated risks are equally obvious, particularly in terms of privacy (the Big Brother spectrum), and the guarantees provided to citizens will depend on the political systems concerned. 
With the emergence of CBDCs (desirable for the industry 4.0), it is necessary to question the relevance of a monetary purpose for existing blockchains. In any case, the debate must be held.
For the sake of clarity, it is useful to refer to the classification proposed by FINMA for tokens.
FINMA distinguishes between:
In the absence of CBDC, confusion has occurred mechanically. Payment tokens (such as Bitcoin) behave like investment tokens, and utility tokens like payment tokens and/or investment tokens (ICOs). 
Some regulators have, involuntarily, contributed to this confusion by qualifying tokens as utility tokens, which are in fact investment tokens, at least from an economic point of view.
This is the case when the token, at the time of its issuance, cannot be used for anything other than an investment function (to be resold and traded on a trading platform). FINMA and the SEC quickly considered such tokens as investment products.
France, in adopting the “Pacte Law” (Loi Pacte), did not go that far, considering itself bound by a formal definition of financial securities imposed by European law (and confirmed by ESMA, the European financial regulator, it should be noted).
However, France had a national regime (intermediaries in “miscellaneous goods”) flexible enough to deal with tokens with no utility other than a financial one, according to a conception similar to that of the Swiss and American regulators. Finally, it opted for a compromise (commendable given the prevailing confusion) of an ad hoc regime (Pacte Law), where “service providers on digital assets” (PSANs) are regulated in the same way whether they are payment tokens or utility tokens.   
How then to define a healthy distribution of the roles of each typology of blockchain (monetary, utility and investment)?
Simply put, the monetary function in the strict sense should naturally be exercised by Central Banks, which are the only bodies in a position to apply a monetary policy in the general interest (setting the key rate, controlling inflation, etc.).
These State cryptocurrencies will be the preferred means of payment to access decentralized applications and/or tokenized financial products (investment tokens).
As an illustration, Facebook could give up the monetary dimension of Libra and assign it a utilitarian function in the fight against fake news and fake profiles. Thus, users of its social networks would buy Libra tokens in CBDC to authenticate shared content and identify its authors.
As for Bitcoin, it will never be able to compete with CBDCs, especially when they become interoperable. This does not mean that Bitcoin cannot be used as a means of exchange if the parties concerned agree, but its primary function will ultimately remain that of a store of value, a savings product, calling for a minimum level of investor protection.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Desert to Power Initiative gains momentum in Burkina Faso</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The board of directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a €48,82 million ($54 million) loan to the government of Burkina Faso for the Yeleen solar plant, intended to boost national power supply.
Yeleen, which is to be implemented under the Bank’s Desert to Power (DTP) Initiative, and which will span a period of five years from 2020-2024, is the second project under the DTP initiative in Burkina Faso.
The total project cost is estimated at €136.69 million. The rest of the financing for Yeleen is provided by Agence Française de Développement (AFD), European Union (EU), and Société Nationale d'électricité du Burkina Faso (SONABEL).
The electricity access rate in Burkina Faso is one of the lowest in Africa at around 21% at national level in 2018.
Upon completion, the project will increase and diversify electricity supply through the construction of four new 52 MWc photovoltaic (PV) plants and extend power distribution networks to connect 30,000 new households, or about 200,000 people. It will also contribute to the avoidance of 48,000 tCO2eq emissions annually.
Wale Shonibare, the Bank’s Acting Vice-President for Power, Energy, Climate Change & Green Growth said: “This project will augment the Bank’s efforts to ensure inclusive access to energy through improvements in rural electrification, regional interconnections and energy sector reforms. Notably, it will increase Burkina Faso’s generation capacity by 15%, which will greatly help to reduce Burkina Faso’s reliance on fossil fuel imports.”
Dr Daniel Schroth, the Bank’s Acting Director for Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency also added that the approval would further the Desert to Power Initiative’s momentum in line with commitments made at the Sahel G5 Summit on 13th September in Ouagadougou. 
“With this project, we are making concrete progress on two of the five priority areas under the Desert to Power initiative which include adding new solar generation capacity and strengthening the transmission and distribution networks,” said Schroth.
The current project is part of Burkina Faso’s broader 2025 Solar Programme, known as “Yeleen” with three components:
The rural electrification “ Yeleen rural electrification project" which aims to increase electricity access in Burkina Faso by connecting 150,000 households to solar mini- grids (50,000 household) and through stand-alone solar kits systems (100,000 households) was approved by the Bank in December 2018 with joint financing with EU and GCF.
The Desert to Power initiative aims to accelerate economic development by adding solar energy generation capacity of up to 10GW by 2025 through a combination of public and private interventions.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">State-run trading firm MMTC has already floated a tender for buying 21,090 metric tonnes (MT) of onions from Turkey and Egypt and the shipments are expected to arrive mid-January
The central government has given its approval to import of 36,090 metric tonnes of onions amid the ongoing supply crunch. Of this, 21,090 metric tonnes of onions are already contracted, which includes 6,090 metric tonnes from Egypt and 15,000 metric tonnes from Turkey, while the government will issue tenders for 15,000 metric tonnes of onions. The country had last imported 1,987 tonnes of onion in FY16, which happens to be the only year India imported onions in the last five years.
State-run trading firm MMTC, which is importing onions on the behalf of the government, has already floated a tender for buying 21,090 metric tonnes (MT) of the key kitchen staple from Turkey and Egypt and the shipments are expected to arrive mid-January. Of this, MMTC has contracted 4,000 MT of onions from Turkey which is expected to arrive by mid-January, 2020. This 4,000 MT is in addition to the 17,090 MT of onions already contracted which includes 6,090 MT arriving from Egypt and 11,000 MT from Turkey. The delivery from Egypt is expected in second week of this month, while import from Turkey is expected in the last week of December.
The department of consumer affairs has also directed MMTC to issue three more tenders for import of onions, out of which two tenders are country-specific, namely Turkey and European Union, and one is a global tender. Each of these tenders is for 5,000 MT.
On November 20, the union cabinet had given its nod to import up to 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of onions after retail onion prices touched a high of over Rs 100 per kg in some parts of the country. MMTC has been directed to import up to 1 lakh tonnes of the commodity from the global market.

The move comes after the government's various efforts to boost the domestic availability failed to curb retail prices. Retail onion prices have touched above Rs 150/kg in some cities across India. Onion was sold at Rs 165/kg in Panaji (Goa), Rs 160/kg in Mayabunder (Andaman) and Rs 150/kg in Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode on Friday.
Onion prices shot up due to 26 per cent decline in production at 52.06 lakh tonnes during the kharif season of 2019-20 as untimely and prolonged rains caused damage to crop.

The Centre has already taken a decision to provide certain relaxations in the new tenders issued such as size range of onions have been expanded to 40mm-80mm, consortium bidding has been allowed, exporters can offer shipment in multiple lots. Adding to it, fumigation condition relaxations that were earlier provided till 30 November, 2019 have now been extended till 31 December, 2019. This is expected to further increase participation, competition and reduce price.
A coordination committee has also been formed by the department of consumer affairs to ensure that the entire process of import and distribution is streamlined so as to ensure timely arrivals and movement of onions and sale by states. The committee is holding meetings on a daily basis with participation from officials of MMTC, NAFED, CONCOR and associated ministries and departments.
The government has also planned procurement of domestically produced onions from major onion producing states. Onions procured from major onion producing states will be distributed across all consuming states as per the demand placed by them. On 3 December, 2019, the union government had revised stock holding limit on Onions to 25 MT on Wholesalers and 5 MT on Retailers. Importers will be exempted from these stock limits for imported stock.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: Around 10 senior employees of Asian securities firm CLSA’s India unit are likely to join rival Jefferies, ET NOW reported on Monday citing sources.
These include employees from research as well as sales division, report said.
CLSA analysts Mahesh Nandurkar and Ashish Agrawal are among those employees who are making the switch.
Emails sent to CLSA and Jefferies seeking a confirmation were not yet replied to.
Christopher Wood was appointed as global head of equity Strategy at Jefferies in May. Wood, one of the top-ranked market strategists, joined Jefferies from CLSA, where he spent around two decades.
Wood’s exit from CLSA earlier this year was the latest in a string of high-level resignations at the rocked Hong Kong-based securities firm in recent times.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SoftBank and The University of Tokyo teamed on a project to boost development of AI in Japan, establishing a research institute in the nation’s capital city to study the impact of the technology on industry and society.
Under a partnership agreement, the pair will establish the Beyond AI Institute. In a statement, SoftBank explained this would bring “top-level researchers from the University of Tokyo and leading universities abroad” together, to “conduct fundamental research for key AI technology” while also tapping relevant research from other academic fields.
The institute will predominantly focus on areas including healthcare, manufacturing, and public works and social infrastructure.
SoftBank stated the partnership was made possible by a Japanese initiative designed to accelerate collaborations between academia and businesses: “Using this system will create an ecosystem where it will be possible to quickly envision commercialisation through joint ventures at the research stage and invest returns from business ventures into future research activities”.
The conglomerate explained the collaboration would contribute to research which would “lead Japan’s AI revolution”.
Fundamental research will be undertaken in the university’s Hongo Campus, while the facility for applied research will be established at the future SoftBank headquarters in Takeshiba, expected to open during the fiscal year ending 31 March 2021.
To set up the AI research institute, SoftBank will spend JPY20 billion ($184 million) over ten years, South China Morning Post reported.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Slowdown only cyclical, India's growth potential not lost: Chief Economic Advisor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The economic slowdown which India is facing at present is only cyclical in nature, and the country has not lost its growth potential, which signifies that the economy will bounce back, Chief Economic Advisor K Subramanian said.
Subramanian said that there was, needless to say, a slowdown in the economy but it needs to be assessed whether it was structural or cyclical in nature.
India’s GDP growth in Q1 of the current financial year, fell to a 6-year low of 5%, while Q2 slowed down further to 4.5%.
The Reserve Bank of India has also lowered its GDP forecast for 2019-20 from 6.1% to 5%.
“My take is that this is a lot more on the cyclical side, because there has been no change in the demographics, there has been no change in the demand in the medium term and the ability of companies to supply,” he said at the FICCI young leaders summit here on Monday.
“and if anything, we are now doing a lot of reforms, and reforms enhance the productivity of the economy,” he added.
He said that the potential growth rate of the country was unaltered, the reason why the economy will come back on track, he said, without indicating a time period, however.
“As we showed clearly in the economic survey that for an economy like India, it is actually investment, especially private investment that is the key driver of economic growth,” he said.
He said that there was a well thought-out agenda behind implementation of the reforms that the government was introducing.
“So the steps we are taking, be it the corporate tax rate cut, the code on wages and industrial relations, is trying to create a more favourable environment for investment, which is what we require for sustained growth,” he said.
“The laws of economics are quite strong and what basically takes us down, also brings us up,” he added.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in November this year said that while the growth rate had come down, there was no fear of recession.
Sitharaman had in September announced corporate tax rate cut from an effective 35% (including surcharges and cesses) to an effective 25.17% while the rate for new manufacturing companies reduced to 15% from 25%.
The CEA also said that the government was not complacent of what was needed to be done, continuous stakeholder discussions are being held to see what recuperative measures could be further taken.

    <h5 class="mb-1">French-listed behemoth Elis weighs bid for Spotless Laundries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's a French behemoth weighing a bid for Spotless' up-for-sale commercial laundries business.
Street Talk understands the €4.1 billion, Euronext-listed Elis has been mulling making a play for the division, with the second round of the auction to get underway on Australia Day.
Spotless – controlled by Downer Group – mandated Sydney-based corporate VCA Partners earlier this year to run an auction for the laundries business, which was spruiked as Australia's No.1 player in linen.
It's fair to say VCA Partners isn't in any great rush to hurry the sales process along, especially with two weeks until Christmas. In fact, sources reckon slowing things down will allow trade interest to build and give the buyout firms a run for their money.
From where Street Talk sits, VCA would want the likes of Phil Cave's Anchorage Capital Partners – who bought commercial laundry and dry-cleaning business South Pacific Laundry in late 2018 – to take a look under the hood.
Potential bidder Elis has a long-standing working relationship with Deutsche Bank. The investment bank advised it during its £2.2 billion takeover of British textile maintenance service provider Berendsen in 2017.
So if Elis were to lob a bid, it'd be a safe bet that Deutsche would be on the ticket.
Elis generated €3.1 billion in revenue in 2018 and €985.6 million in earnings. The company operates in 28 countries, across 440 plants with almost 50,000 employees.
Spotless Laundries meanwhile has 13 plants around Australia that are supported by a fleet of 275 delivery vehicles and five depots, according to its sale flyer sent out in October.
In that flyer, interested parties were told Spotless Laundries was expected to record $265.3 million in revenue and $59.1 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the 2020 financial year.
Prior to tapping VCA Partners, Street Talk revealed Spotless had hired PwC to run vendor due diligence on the unit ahead of a potential sale.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Swiss healthcare costs have 'doubled' since 2000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Recently released figures show that health insurance premiums have doubled in the past 20 years, with some Swiss households spending almost one fifth of their salary on healthcare.
Figures from the Swiss Trade Union show that costs have increased by 120 percent on average since the year 2000. 
The increases are much higher than wages, while other cost-mitigating changes like rebates for people on lower incomes have also failed to keep up with rising premiums.

Couples with household salaries between 60,000 and 90,000 francs spend on average 14 percent of their salaries on healthcare. 
In some of the more expensive cantons such as Bern and Zurich, the amount can be higher than 20 percent. 
While lower income Swiss will be eligible for reductions and rebates, middle-income Swiss are often hit the hardest by increases in healthcare costs. 
More going into debt to pay for healthcare
The impact of the cost increases can be seen in relation to household debt for healthcare. 
At the turn of the millennium, just over a third (36 percent) of households in Switzerland had healthcare debts higher than 5000 francs. 
At the present time, 59 percent of households had accrued debts of over 10,000 francs for healthcare costs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hotels and restaurants in East of England 'at heightened risk of insolvency'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The East of England's agricultural sector is healthier than most other parts of the UK - but construction, hotel and restaurant businesses are at heightened risk, a report suggests.
A study by insolvency and restructuring specialists R3 Eastern shows that farming is outperforming its regional counterparts with one of the lowest levels of elevated insolvency risk in the UK.
But other business sectors in the region are struggling, figures compiled by R3 for November suggests.
MORE - Farming has 'great future' - but it must change, says new farm co-op chairThe trade body, which used Bureau Van Dijk's Fame database, found around one in three agricultural businesses - or 32.9% - are at higher than normal risk of insolvency - one of the lowest statistics for the sector in the UK. Only London and the north east have lower percentages.
Wales has the highest percentage at 45.3% - more than nine points above the UK average of 36.2%.
Other sectors in the East of England are faring less well, figures suggest.
Construction has the third highest proportion of businesses at above average risk across the UK regions with almost half - 45.6% - about 2% above the UK average of 43.7%. Only the south east and south west have a higher percentage of construction businesses at elevated risk of insolvency, with levels of 47.2% and 47.8% respectively.
The research also showed 37.4% of hotel companies in the region judged to be at elevated insolvency risk in November - more than 5% above the UK-wide figure of 32%. The picture is similar for the region's restaurant operators, with 35.2% at heightened risk of insolvency compared to the UK average of 32.9%, a gap of more than 2%.
R3 Eastern chair Mark Upton, a partner at Ensors Chartered Accountants in East Anglia, said: "It is encouraging to see local agricultural businesses outperforming their national competition but the regional picture overall is no cause for celebration. We have to be realistic that the East of England, and the UK as a whole, continues to face some strong economic challenges.
"Uncertainty and stop-start stockpiling are among the factors hitting local investment and wider business health, and members of the insolvency and restructuring profession report anecdotally that they are seeing increasing numbers of companies worrying about their cashflow levels and order books."

    <h5 class="mb-1">$251m equity raising a bridge too FAR?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Blue sky Senegalese oil play FAR Ltd has told shareholders all about a planned $US350 million-odd debt raising – but what about its equally if not more ambitious equity offer?
Street Talk can reveal FAR has spent the past week pitching a $251 million equity raising to fund managers, which was to be done via a placement of new shares and help fund its aim to be one of the biggest ASX-listed oil producers.
It is understood FAR and its brokers started crossing fund managers early last week – and judging by the fact it is yet to hit the tape, we can only assume it hasn’t had as strong a reception as the explorer was hoping for.
The mooted deal was slated as a $251 million placement underwritten by Macquarie Capital and Bell Potter, according to a presentation sent to wall-crossed investors and seen by Street Talk, although fundies reckon Macquarie has either dropped off or was never there and FAR was now talking about a non-underwritten deal via Bell Potter.
The proposed placement was subject to FAR receiving binding and committed terms for a senior debt facility – arranged by Macquarie as announced last month but now said to include “several leading financial institutions” - by December 31.
The twin debt and equity raisings would see FAR secure $US520 million ($768 million). Proceeds are earmarked primarily to develop the Sangomar field – a $US4.2 billion ($6.2 billion) oil project in Senegal in which it was controversially joined by Woodside Petroleum in 2016 – with the cost to FAR put at $US492 million ($727 million) to reach start-up, the presentation said.
FAR was originally targeting project financing for the venture, but those plans were derailed by the ongoing arbitration it initiated over Woodside's buyout of ConocoPhillips's stake in the project, then known as SNE.
But with Woodside sticking to a final investment decision by the year-end, for production to start "by early 2023", FAR does not have time on its side.
The placement was to have been followed by a non-underwritten share purchase plan to raise up to another $30 million.
It’s a tall ask for the Africa-focused oil and gas explorer, which has a $340 million market capitalisation and a number of sceptics in the institutional investment community.
As of after-market on Monday, the latest iteration of the deal, or "plan D" was $100 million in new equity and $150 million in mezzanine debt. Cornerstone investors were being sought, sources told this column.
It is not known at what price FAR was aiming to secure the equity injection. The prolonged sounding process is no doubt trying to determine what price – if any – fund managers would be willing to back the blue sky story.
It comes after Woodside and its partners in Sangomar – which include Cairn Energy and Senegal's Petrosen – took a significant step towards committing to construction last week, submitting a development plan to the government just before their licence expired.
FAR’s shares closed at 5.4¢ on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cooper Energy poised to get its Sole, Downer leaves site</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Street Talk has been on gas watch.
And in our sights has been Cooper Energy's delayed Sole project in south-eastern Victoria, the state worst hit by the tightness in east coast gas supply.
It's understood contractors from Downer have been demobilising at the Orbost gas plant – owned by APA Group – which would process the gas from the Sole field. Getting this plant up and running is the last hurdle to Sole becoming a producing asset.
[To be clear, APA owns the processing plant while Cooper owns the gas field]
It is expected Downer will hand over the plant's reins to APA in the coming days, which would then begin first phase commissioning and following that would start processing gas from the Sole project.
It's believed the first gas processed from Sole would be in early 2020.
The near completion of the Orbost gas plant would be welcome news for Cooper's management and shareholders. The delay caused the $876 million company to defer production and Cooper was receiving liquidated damages during the deferral period.
The Sole project accounts for 78 per cent of Cooper's gas reserves and is expected to account for around 80 per cent of gas production.
Once production kicks off, the Sole asset would become significantly de-risked. Street Talk would be willing to bet the likes of Beach Energy and Mitsui are watching with interest.
The news comes as oil and gas producer Senex Energy's Atlas project in Queensland delivered its first gas to state-owned power generator CleanCo. Within weeks it will start delivering gas to building products maker CSR.
The Atlas project is the first in Queensland where output is exclusively for domestic use.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thrifty father-of-three reveals how he saves £2,000 a year and even gets money off his utility bills - just by scanning his supermarket receipts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A thrifty father-of-three has revealed how he saves more than £2,000 a year using four shopping apps, that he checks on during his lunch break.
Peter Chatfield, 39, from Deal in Kent, scans receipts for bread, milk, yoghurt and chocolate into the apps to claim back part of their cost - and even does this twice when two are running the same offer.
He estimates that he makes £500 in profit from cashback a year, as well as saving £1,500 through special offers.  
The civil servant started counting the pennies seven years ago after his wife Sharon, 39, fell unexpectedly pregnant with their third child just after they had moved into a four-bedroom detached house.
Revealing his savings secrets, Pete told FEMAIL how he monitors the apps Clicksnap, Checkoutsmart, Greenjinn and Shopmium for the latest supermarket offers. 
'It will tell you which goods are on offer and then you go to the supermarket, buy the item, take it home and scan in the receipt. In the same day they send you the money,' he told FEMAIL. 
'You're looking at a minute tops - it takes no time at all.'
Sometimes the apps have the same offers at the same time, allowing Pete to cash in twice for an item and put himself into profit.
They also give him the option of shopping in either Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, ASDA, Waitrose or going online to shop with Ocado. 
Pete raked in five months free fibre broadband from NOW TV Broadband by using an offer from a cashback site and his bank.
After paying for the £25 a month provider he went through TopCashback to get a £90 refund, and then also received a £40 discount through his bank for paying for the service through them.
The refund means Pete only has to pay £14.17 a month, or has five months internet completely free!
On Uswitch NOW TV Broadband was not the cheapest deal, with Origin Superfast Fibre offering only £20 a month internet, but when all the offers were added up the more expensive one ended up saving him more.

'Clicksnap and Checkoutsmart basically have the same offers where you can submit your receipts for both and then you get paid for both.
'The obvious items are usually free but sometimes about half price or a bit over - so you can end up in profit.
Shoppers at Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Ocado can save money with this little-known app. 
It features exclusive offers every week. When FEMAIL checked it offered 75p cashback for Yeo Valley yoghurt buyers, worth £2.75, and £1.15 back for those buying Yorkshire Tea bedtime brew, worth £2.30.
 Shoppers at Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, and Sainsbury's can make savings with this app.
When FEMAIL checked it was offering Jude's ice cream reduced to £1.50, worth £4, and free beef jerky, worth £3.20. It also had deals on Yorkshire Tea bedtime brew and Yeo Valley yoghurt. 
Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Holland & Barrett and Ocado shoppers should use this app.
Downloaded onto your phone, when FEMAIL checked it had 60p off Fruit'n'Fibre cereal, worth £2.79, and 40p off Galbani Mozzarella Maxi cheese, worth £2.25.
Tesco, Sainsbury's, ASDA, Morrisons and Waitrose shoppers can take advantage of this app.
When FEMAIL checked it had 50 per cent off Uncle Ben's One Pot Rice Kit Caribbean Jerk, worth £2.79, and 70 per cent off Morrisons Toffee Apple Crown pastries, worth £1. 
'One time I got about 60p back on bread through an offer on both apps, so it made me a 20p profit plus free bread.'
Pete said he reckons he makes 'well over' £500 in profit a year through this loophole.
'If you're doing all the offers you could probably make £5 to £10 a week just from that', he said. 'That's once you're getting your free stuff as well.' 
The government worker checks the apps during his lunch breaks at work at least once a week, because the offers switch around every week to two weeks.
To rake back in even more pounds, Pete also takes advantage of offers on cashback websites Quidco and TopCashback.
This year, he managed to pair two offers to save £130 and get NOW TV Broadband for free. 
After buying the £25-a-month internet, he got £90 refunded through TopCashback and then a further £40 from his bank Santander for choosing the company. 
The money saved has allowed the family to take the trip of a lifetime to Disneyland, Florida.
Glowing pictures show the thrilled couple and smiling Cara, 10, George, 9, and Amy, 6, in front of the Disney Palace and meeting Mickey and Minnie Mouse at the Animal Kingdom.
Proud father Pete managed the fantastic October holiday through simply saving on shopping and taking advantage of more cashback offers.
'The flights were far cheaper because  we went in October. So, for us it was £1,400 whereas usually peak time you're looking at over £2,000.
'I got cashback through Topcashback for car parking for the car hire, we also got some money back as new customers through Airbnb and travel insurance again was with cashback.'
He took the children for a week during their October half-term and then a further week off that was authorised by the school.
Pete's job has made it almost impossible to get away over the summer, because of preparations for a supposed no-deal Brexit, which didn't come to pass.
Money saving app ZipZero will transfer one per cent of your total bill back to you to spend on utility bills.
After scanning a receipt in on any purchase made in a UK shop, it then immediately makes the money available for gas, water, electricity or another household utility.
With a head office based in London, on its website ZipZero says: 'We founded ZIPZERO because we wanted to find a way to help households get out of the rut of making ends meet.
'For us, paying zero for our monthly bills is everything.'

The family started saving when they were 'really struggling financially' - and haven't stopped since.
'I was desperate to cut bills and make some extra money', said Pete, ' that's how I fell into it.'
Pete said that since starting to save the extra money, the quality of life of his family has been improved.
'It's something I enjoy but, you know, it's taken a lot of financial stress off us so we can relax a lot more', he said.
'My wife is really impressed that I go through these apps, but sometimes rolls her eyes.'
So pleased with his savings, Pete launched blog Household Money Saving where he tells fellow savers about his expert tips for cutting bills on everything including wifi, testing websites and reviewing adverts.
Thrifty father Peter Chatfield, 39, has explained how families should slowly ease themselves into money saving.
'Aim small first because that's how you do it', Pete told FEMAIL.
'People look at these things and think, "oh that's a tiny saving what's the point?", but when you add these things up over a day, over a week, and over a year you know it all adds up.
'It doesn't take much effort and anybody can do any of these things so yeah - start small.'
Pete claimed he had saved more than £2,000 a year since starting, and has even made £500 profit a year when he gets extra money back for buying products.
He achieves this by scanning receipts into apps Clicksnap, Checkoutsmart, Greenjinn and Shopmium.
Since getting into saving he has also set up a blog called Household Money Saving where he tells followers how to save on purchases.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share Market News Today | Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE: The headline indices Sensex and Nifty ended marginally higher on Monday afternoon, amid volatility. The Sensex closed about 43 points higher to 40,487.43, while the Nifty  closed near the 11,950-mark. TCS, HCL Tech, L&T were among the biggest losers, shedding up to 3%. Asian stocks edged up on Monday, catching some of Wall Street’s momentum after surprisingly strong US jobs data although regional gains were capped by concerns about China’s economy due to the prolonged Sino-US trade war. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.3% while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3%, with Australian stocks and South Korea’s Kospi up 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The dollar held firm on Monday after data showed surprise strength in the US jobs market, but the currency was restrained from moving higher by worries about an escalation in the US-China trade war. The dollar index stood almost flat at 97.704 in early Asian trade on Monday, after rising 0.3% on Friday, Reuters reported.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Winners of the Digital Sky Challenge announced</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS - The winners of the aviation challenge themed as Digital Sky Challenge1 were announced at the awards ceremony as part of the SESAR Innovation Days2 on 4 December in Athens.
Jointly organised by the SESAR JU and ACI Europe and hosted by Athens International Airport, the Digital Sky Challenge took place on 2-4 December in a dedicated airside facility of the airport. The event brought together 52 young tech-talents from 11 European countries competing in 12 teams to create breakthrough prototype solutions to address 3 different challenges: 1. Streamlining the passenger experience, 2. Improving the Environment, 3. Enhancing safety – with the support of several key partners3.
The teams pitched and demoed their solutions to a distinguished judging panel4 which selected the winning teams based on four criteria: level of innovation, business value, design and overall quality of the prototypes.
Passenger Experience Challenge: Innov’ATMThe winning team5 was Innov’ATM, who came up with an innovative app to reduce the stress of travelling while improving airline punctuality. The app helps to track passengers with their consent, so that airlines, airports and ATC know where they are. It offers clear benefits which are marketable and doable.
Safety Challenge: JBMThe winning team6 was JBM. With no prior aviation background, the winning team successfully developed from scratch a safety-net capable of analysing distances between aircraft in order to alert of and thus avert potential incidents.
Environment challenge: Eco-TravellersThe Environment challenge award7 went to Eco-Travellers. The team developed a tool that allows passengers to select the best and most green mobility option, integrating multiple modes of transport. The tool took into account existing systems and carbon offsetting schemes.
Special Recognition AwardsBoth Honeywell & Airbus selected the JBM team, who was also the winner of the Safety challenge. They were impressed by the novelty and usefulness of their separation management tool. Innaxis gave a special recognition to AerLabs for its AI-based solution that forecasts weather disruption in order to enable airlines to better access the probability of making flight cancellations.
The solutions that have been generated are now open for further development.
Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of SESAR JU concluded: “Congratulations to all the winning and participating teams in the Digital Sky Challenge - it was truly inspiring to see how much innovation could be achieved in only 48 hours! It clearly demonstrates the amazing talent pool that European aviation has at its disposal. Industry is already expressing an interest in the solutions so I am confident that this is not the end but the beginning of an exciting journey for our winners!”
Olivier Jankovec, Director General of ACI Europe said: “Hats off to the winners of the Digital Sky Challenge for delivering in just 48 hours truly innovative solutions that can help advance airport operations – with tangible benefits for passengers, the environment and safety. I have been truly impressed by the agility and creativity of Innov’ATM, JBM, Eco-Travellers and AerLabs. I hope their solutions will soon make their way into fully developed and marketed tools and wish them every success for the future.”
Dr. Yiannis Paraschis, CEO of Athens International Airport said: “Our highest respect to the winning teams of the Digital Sky Challenge. They gained the admiration of the jury, but they also attracted the interest and attention of highly important aviation stakeholders, with the degree of innovation, and overall quality of their solutions. We feel extremely proud that Athens International Airport was the first airport site to host the Digital Sky Challenge and indeed privileged to have been able to contribute to the “reinvention” of aviation, through this dynamic and innovative 48-hour “digital sprint” that united the aviation industry on our premises“.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Useful tips and tricks to deal with load shedding | IOL News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - As South Africans brace for a dark festive season, experts have offered useful tips and tricks to help deal with ongoing load shedding.
On Monday morning, Eskom announced that the planned Stage 2 load shedding would move to stage 4 from 10am until 11pm due to additional loss of units at its power stations.
The entity also said the probability of load shedding remained high for the week as a result of a shortage of capacity.
To help deal with this, Budget Insurance has offered various ways consumers can cope with the ongoing power cuts, all while saving money and looking after the environment.
“Many South Africans are left scratching their heads on how to cope with high energy prices, as well as how to curb load shedding and its effects on their businesses and homes,” says Budget Insurance's Susan Steward.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Equity benchmark BSE Sensex on Monday fell over 70 points in early trade, dragged mainly by losses in financial and banking stocks amid persistent foreign fund outflows.
The 30-share index was trading 73.38 points or 0.18 per cent lower at 40,371.77 in morning trade; while the broader Nifty was trading 26.10 points or 0.22 per cent down at 11,895.40.
In the previous session, Sensex settled at 40,445.15, down 334.44 points or 0.82 per cent. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty shed 96.90 points or 0.81 per cent to close at 11,921.50.
Bajaj Finance was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack with a decline by 1.28 per cent in morning deals, followed by HUL, ITC, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Axis Bank.
On the other hand, Maruti, Vedanta, Tata Steel, HDFC, Tata Motors and Sun Pharma emerged as the gainers, rising up to 1.72 per cent.
Meanwhile, the rupee appreciated by 10 paise to 71.10 in early session on Monday.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) offloaded shares worth Rs 867.66 crore in the capital market on Friday, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares to the tune of Rs 210.72 crore, data available with the stock exchange showed.
Asian stocks were trading mostly higher on Monday following strong US job data amid weak Chinese exports.
American employers added 266,000 jobs in November, according to the Labor Department data released on Friday.
Marking the fourth straight fall, Chinese exports declined 1.1 in November compared to the same month a year earlier, mainly dragged by weaker shipments to the US that fell 23 per cent.
Brent futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.33 per cent to USD 64.18 per barrel.

    <h5 class="mb-1">airBaltic receives the Regional Airline of the Year Award by CAPA</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Latvian airline airBaltic received the CAPA Regional Airline of the Year award in a special ceremony in Malta on December 5, 2019. For the second time, airBaltic has been recognised as the leader of the regional aviation sector by CAPA's Aviation Awards for Excellence which is held annually since 2003 with professionals participating from airlines around the world.
Martin Gauss, Chief Executive Officer of airBaltic said: “We at airBaltic have had yet another year of intense work and successful growth. We have continued developing our services, modernising the fleet and widening the route network for better connectivity. More passengers appreciate our product and choose airBaltic as their carrier. As a result, our total market share in the Baltics this year has reached 37%, ranking airBaltic the No 1 airline in Latvia and Estonia with 60% and 21% of market share respectively. The CAPA Regional Airline of the Year award is a great honour and an excellent motivation for our team to follow the course of constant improvement and growth.”
CAPA Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said: “airBaltic combines an LCC cost base with a compelling business class product, while its route network meshes point to point demand with a hub and spoke model. Its growth and return to profit, built on a strong market share in its home market of Latvia and the wider Baltic region, should certainly attract investor interest.”
airBaltic has been among the fastest growing airlines in Northern Europe, reaching double digit passenger growth each month for more than three years running. The airline has significantly developed its route network from 16 destinations in 2002 to 70+ today spanning Europe, Scandinavia, the CIS and the Middle East. In 2018, airBaltic carried four million passengers and by the end of this year the airline is expecting to carry five million passengers.
airBaltic holds a leading position in the Baltic region, being the market leader at Riga International Airport by record high market share and an established presence at Vilnius and Tallinn airports with a competitive cost structure. According to a recent study by business strategy consultants Roland Berger, airBaltic directly and indirectly contributed 2.5% to Latvia’s GDP in 2018 and supported close to 30 000 jobs.
The strong performance of the airline enabled airBaltic to become the first airline in Central and Eastern Europe to access the international debt capital markets with a Eurobond offering. In July 2019, airBaltic successfully issued EUR 200 million five-year bonds which will be used to strengthen company’s liquidity and continue investments into fleet. Investors have clearly shown that they see airBaltic's strategy as mature and strong. airBaltic regards all these achievements as good preconditions for an eventual IPO in the coming years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Metallurgical coal project developer Aspire Mining has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sinosteel Equipment & Engineering (Sinosteel MECC) to develop Mongolia’s Ovoot coking coal project.
The non-binding agreement covers potential engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) as well as trade-based funding opportunities for the Ovoot Early Development Project (OEDP).
Aspire Mining’s MoU comes after the company completed a $33.5m placement with shareholder Tserenpuntsag Tserendamba earlier this month, increasing the latter’s stake in the company from 27.5% to 51%.
The pre-feasibility study (PFS) of the OEDP includes construction of a five million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP) at the Ovoot mine site. The construction cost of the CHPP is estimated at $37m.
Under the MoU with Sinosteel, Aspire Mining is required to share information on the mine development pertaining to permitting and licenses, transport logistics and project financing.
Meanwhile, the company will also be allowed to access Sinosteel’s Coal Trading Platform, through which coal can be sold on a spot basis in China.
Aspire Mining executive chairman David Paull said: “Aspire recognises the importance of having a strong partnership with companies like Sinosteel MECC that play such a major role in the Chinese steel industry, the main market for Ovoot’s high-quality coking coal product.
“We look forward to working alongside Sinosteel MECC as one of our key partners in bringing the Ovoot Early Development Project into production and delivering value for all shareholders.”
The company expects to complete a definitive feasibility study (DFS) around May next year, subject to receiving the necessary permits and approvals to complete drilling of the mine.
If financing is secured and all permits are received by the first quarter of next year, Aspire Mining expects to begin pre-stripping of waste at Ovoot from the third quarter of the same year.
