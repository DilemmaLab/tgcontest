    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An online company that allows users to obtain a copy of their birth and death certificates from U.S. state governments has exposed a massive cache of applications — including their personal information.
More than 752,000 applications for copies of birth certificates were found on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage bucket. (The bucket also had 90,400 death certificate applications, but these could not be accessed or downloaded.)
The bucket wasn’t protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew the easy-to-guess web address access to the data.
Each application process differed by state, but performed the same task: allowing customers to apply to their state’s record-keeping authority — usually a state’s department of health — to obtain a copy of their historical records. The applications we reviewed contained the applicant’s name, date-of-birth, current home address, email address, phone number and historical personal information, including past addresses, names of family members and the reason for the application — such as applying for a passport or researching family history.
The applications dated back to late-2017 and the bucket was updating daily. In one week, the company added about 9,000 applications to the bucket.
U.K.-based penetration testing company Fidus Information Security found the exposed data. TechCrunch verified the data by matching names and addresses against public records.
Fidus and TechCrunch sent several emails prior to publication to warn of the exposed data, but we received only automated emails and no action was taken. We are not naming the company. When reached, Amazon would not intervene but said it would inform the customer.
We also reached out to the local data protection authority to warn of the security lapse, but it did not immediately comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snapchat working on 'deepfake' feature which is not as sinister as it sounds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat is working on a ‘deepfake’ feature which will let users add their face to videos.
The new tool is called Cameo and will allow people to replace faces in clips with their own beautiful visage.
A deepfake video uses artificial intelligence to map the likeness of one person onto another.
It’s feared that the technology will be used to destabilise society because it allows the creation of highly convincing fake news.
But there are good reasons not to fear the arrival of Cameo.
It’s being tested in France right now and is likely to be rolled out across the world in the coming weeks or months.
In a statement, Snapchat said: ‘Cameos aren’t ready to take the stage yet, but stay tuned for their global debut soon.’
Deepfake is a portmanteau combining the words ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’, referring to simulated videos of human beings.
Its power has been vividly showcased in footage which shows the
The tech uses machine learning or artificial intelligence to combine digital images with audio files to make convincing-looking fake footage of people uttering words they’ve actually said.
We’ve already it used to bring the Mona Lisa spring to life, whilst pornographers are already creating deepfake sex videos which make it look like mainstream stars are getting involved in the action.
Politics is likely to be profoundly affected by the technology, which was demonstrated recently in a video which appeared to show Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other. 
It’s easy to see how it could be used to make effective propaganda or sew distrust among citizens, who may become unable to work out if a video is fake or genuine.
Snapchat’s own deepfake offering is not as sinister at it sounds for one simple reason: it’s not all that convincing yet.
It will superimpose your face onto a video, sure, but the resulting creation is not particularly realistic.
This means the feature is more suitable for comedy or the creation of bespoke reaction gifs than, you know, subverting democracy.
Snapchat has created 150 looping video gifs for Cameo. You’ll be able to cut out an image of a face and then add it to an actor’s own features in one of these clips.
You’ll also be able to easily send Cameos in chats.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">High-performance machine is limited to just 350 units
McLaren has announced a road-legal version of its GT4 race car – the 620R.
Limited to just 350 units – all of which will be hand-assembled at the firm’s factory in Woking – the 620R shares much of its componentry with McLaren’s track car.
Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 610bhp and 620Nm of torque, the 620R takes the title as the most powerful car in McLaren’s Sports Series.
It’ll crack 0 to 60mph in just 2.7seconds and hit a top speed of 200mph, sending its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed DCT gearbox. Thanks to features such an adjustable carbon fibre rear wing, the 620R can generate up to 185kg of downforce.
The 620R also benefits from the race car version’s adjustable coilover dampers, with 32 individual settings available per corner. Its cornering performance is bolstered further thanks to stiffer anti-roll bars, carbon-ceramic brakes and ultra-sticky Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tyres.
Inside, the air conditioning has been removed, while the carpets and glove box have been removed in the quest for lightness. That said, the audio system and navigation – removed as standard – can be put back in at no extra cost.
Both driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fibre bucket seats with six-point harnesses, while the shift paddles, steering wheel spokes and centre console have all been crafted from the ultra-light material.
As mentioned, the 620R is limited to just 350 units, with each one commanding a £250,000 price tag. European and American buyers get a McLaren track day, featuring expert tuition, included as part of the car’s price, too. Production is set to commence in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google’s first “Pixel feature drop” includes post-snap Portrait Mode, auto Call Screen, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this month, Google rolled out the December Android security patches. The company made some changes to the format they have traditionally used for these monthly releases. Instead of listing “functional patches” on the Pixel Bulletin, Google moved them to the Pixel Community Forum. Today, the company announced another change to how Pixel devices will receive updates with the first-ever “Pixel feature drop.”
Google describes Pixel feature drops as follows:
This inaugural feature drop includes a couple of great features. First, we’ll start with Google Photos. Portrait Mode is a great feature in the Google Camera app, but it does require you to proactively switch modes before snapping a photo. You will now be able to retroactively turn on Portrait Mode on Pixel devices with Google Photos.
Next up is automatic Call Screen on Pixel devices, which is something we discovered in an APK teardown. Google Assistant can automatically screen unknown callers and filter detected robocalls before your phone rings. If the call was not a robocall, your phone will ring a few moments later and show context about who is calling and why. You can find transcripts of these calls in the Dialer app. Google mentions that this is an update to Call Screen specifically on the Pixel 4.
There are a few other odds and ends included in the feature drop. Google Duo gets smoother video calls on poor connections thanks to sound prediction with machine learning and the 90Hz display on the Pixel 4 helps reduce choppiness. Duo also has a new Portrait Mode-esque filter. Memory management has been “enhanced” across all Pixel devices so you can run more apps at the same time. Google also highlighted the features that users discovered in the last security update.
So that’s it for the first Pixel feature drop. This is essentially a rebranded and much more consumer-facing approach to the “functional patches” found in security updates. Google can elaborate on the features much more and make sure users know what’s new.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls and center your Duo videos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To keep its phones from steadily getting worse over time, Google plans to roll out bigger updates, called feature drops, to its Pixel devices. The first feature drop, rolling out this month, will bring the latest Call Screen features and improved Duo video calls to the Pixel 4. And even if you have a slightly older Pixel, the feature drop will let you add Portrait Blur to photos you've already taken.
The Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls using Call Screen. The feature will silently filter out junk calls. If it's not spam, you'll get a description of who's calling and why, so you can decide whether you want to answer. Because Call Screen works on the device, it won't use Wi-Fi or data.
Google is making a few changes to Duo calls, too. On the Pixel 4, Duo will keep you centered in the video frame as you chat. If another person joins you, the frame will automatically adjust to fit them in. If the connection is spotty, a machine learning model on the Pixel 4 will fill in the gaps, guessing which sound was cut out and filling it in, and to reduce video choppiness, Smooth Display will refresh up to 90 times per second.
Pixel 2, 3 and 4 models will also get a portrait filter in Duo, which will blur the background slightly to make you look sharper. You'll be able to apply a similar filter to photos, too. Whether you just took the picture or snapped it years ago, Pixel owners can now add the Portrait Blur in the Google Photos app.
The features are already rolling out, and they should arrive on Pixel devices in the coming weeks. Google plans to make feature drops a regular occurrence, but we don't know what other changes are in the pipeline.

The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
Apple has acknowledged the popping sound issues on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The tech giant says the popping sound coming from the speakers of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a software issue, according to a memo obtained by MacRumors. The company says it will roll out a fix through a software update in the near future. The company advises its Authorised Service providers not to repair or replace the affected MacBook Pros due to it.
As reported by MacRumors, users have taken to Apple Support Communities and Reddit to raise their voice about the popping sound issues. Multiple users have reported hearing popping or clicking sounds coming from the speakers when playing audio or video. The popping sound usually occurs after a user has stopped playing a video or audio. One user has suggested that the issue could be related to Final Cut Pro X. It is unclear when Apple plans to fix the issue, but Apple is currently working on it.
Another issue that has surfaced is slow-response time from the 16-inch MacBook Pro wide-colour display. This issue results in a “ghosting” when scrolling text.

Just last month, Apple released a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that succeeded the original 15-inch MacBook Pro, which has now been permanently discontinued. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is pitched as a premium notebook designed to meet the expectations of video editors, musicians, artists, etc. The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
With the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has made a number of changes to make the new computer standout. Perhaps the most visible change comes in the form of a redesigned keyboard that ditches the flat “butterfly” keyboard, as well as a new thermal architecture. Apple has also improved battery life on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar I-Pace Gets 12 More Miles Of Range From New Software Update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The rumors are true, and Jaguar I-Pace owners can soon visit their local dealer for a free update to boost the electric vehicle's range. The improved software can add up to 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the crossover range.
Jaguar says that the tweaks include optimizations to the battery management, thermal systems, and all-wheel drive torque improvements. The regenerative braking also harvests more energy at low speeds, and the range calculation on the instrument panel is more accurate than before. In an example of race cars improving road-going models, the company says that technical knowhow from the I-Pace eTrophy series is the major contributor to making these upgrades.

"The Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy has generated a huge amount of data for us to analyze and those marginal gains, derived from competition on the track, are now being applied to customers’ cars to further enhance their driving experience," said Stephen Boulter, I-Pace Vehicle Engineering Manager, in the software update's announcement.
The 2020 I-Pace has an EPA-estimated range of 234 miles (377 kilometers) before this update. Jag notes that is upgrade doesn't change that figure. However, the company's testing shows the tweaked software provides an eight percent boost in range "dependent on usage."
As an extra bonus, this software upgrade also enhances the I-Pace's ability to get over-the-air updates in the future by making more of the vehicle's electronic modules available for improvements.
Jaguar seems serious about eventually adding a high-performance version of the I-Pace to the lineup, and it would likely take significant inspiration from the eTrophy racer. Expect the model to have a boost in output and possibly a larger battery to keep the range up. Unfortunately, the vehicle could still be years away because the SVO division is working on other projects.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fulfilling promises
(Image credit: OnePlus)
When OnePlus TV was announced, they made it clear that the software was a big part of the experience. However, Netflix wasn’t natively available back then on the smart TV. That is finally changing with a new software update.
The OnePlus smart TV Q1 and Q1 Pro were made their global debut in India, alongside the OnePlus 7T. Back then, the company promised that Netflix would be a part of the included app ecosystem at a future date. Starting today, all OnePlus TVs sold will have Netflix pre-installed, whereas existing users will receive a software update that will add the entire content catalog of the OTT platform.
The OnePlus TV remote originally had a rather minimal design with only a few buttons, one of them being Prime Video by Amazon. Video streaming platforms usually have a mandate for a dedicated button to launch their app if a smart TV wants to have their content natively supported. It raised a few questions during the launch about how OnePlus will add support for Netflix as the remote had no extra buttons.
The solution came in the form of a new remote, which changes a few things and adds a new Netflix button that can launch the app even if the TV is sleeping. The new remote has a matte black finish and brings the volume rocker to the facia rather than the side. The keys to summon Google Assistant and Prime Video are still present. Going forward, all OnePlus TVs will ship with this new remote.
Existing users can get the new remote for free from the OnePlus Store after their serial number is verified to be from one of the earlier shipment batches. The exact process is detailed on their website if you wish to get your hands on the OnePlus TV Netflix remote.
The OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro run on a customized Android TV OS with better connectivity with smartphones. It sports a 55-inch QLED panel with a 4K resolution and starts at Rs 69,900 in India.

(Image credit: UsTwo Games) Page 1 of 10: Game of the week and the best Android racing games
There are loads of great games available for Android, but how can you pick out the gems from the dross, and amazing touchscreen experiences from botched console ports? With our lists, that’s how!
We cover the best titles on Android right now, including the finest racers, puzzlers, adventure games, arcade titles and more.
- Racing games- Adventure games- Arcade games- Endless runners- Platform games- Puzzle games- Shooting games- Sports games- Strategy games- Word games
We've tried these games out, and looked to see where the costs come in - there might be a free sticker added to some of these in the Google Play Store, but sometimes you'll need an in app purchase (IAP) to get the real benefit - so we'll make sure you know about that ahead of the download.
Check back every other week for a new game, and click through to the following pages to see the best of the best divided into the genres that best represent what people are playing right now.
Dig Dog - Treasure Hunter is a hectic arcade effort that plays out like Dig Dug or Boulder Dash in fast forward. The titular hound hunts for treasure, and must dig its way through levitating islands. Said islands are, naturally, populated by all manner of monsters, and happen to hang over spike pits.
Figuring out where the prize is, ensuring you’ve always got a route back toward the surface, and keeping baddies at bay, are all part and parcel of the pooch’s day – and it’s a hard life. Even when you master super-fast digging actions, it’s easy to miss a foe, or – after digging a little too far – find yourself rapidly heading towards the spikes.
Still, an easy mode gives you a fighting chance of getting to grips with a game that’s hugely rewarding when mastered, marrying old-school cool with modern app design.
Our favorite Android top-down, 3D and retro racers.
Repulze exists in a future beyond racers driving cars far too quickly; instead, they’re placed in experimental hovercraft that belt along at insane speeds. Track design’s traditions have also been ditched, flat courses being replaced by roller-coaster-like constructions that throw you around in stomach-churning fashion.
The game’s split into three phases. It begins with time trials that have you pass through specific colored gates, and ends with you taking on AI opponents, occasionally – and unsportingly – blowing them up with weapons.
There’s a sci-fi backstory about synthetic men and corporations, but really this one’s all about speed. At first, the twitchy controls will find you repeatedly smashing into tracksides and wondering if someone should take your hovercraft license away. But master the tracks and controls alike, and Repulze becomes an exhilarating experience as you bomb along toward the finish line.
Rush Rally 3 brings console-style rally racing to Android. For quick blasts, you can delve into single rally mode, with a co-driver bellowing in your ear; or there’s the grinding metal of rallycross, pitting you against computer cars apparently fueled by aggression. If you’re in it for the long haul, immerse yourself in a full career mode.
None of those options would matter a jot if the racing wasn’t up to much. Fortunately, it’s really good. The game looks the part, with very smart visuals and viewpoints, whether belting around a racing circuit or blazing through a forest.
The controls work well, too, providing a number of setups to accommodate a range of preferences (tilt; virtual buttons) – and skill levels. All in all, it’s enough for the game to get that coveted checkered flag.
If you're fed up with racing games paying more attention to whether the tarmac looks photorealistic rather than how much fun it should be to zoom along at insane speeds, check out Horizon Chase. This tribute to old-school arcade titles is all about the sheer joy of racing, rather than boring realism.
The visuals are vibrant, the soundtrack is jolly and cheesy, and the racing finds you constantly battling your way to the front of an aggressive pack.
If you fondly recall Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge and Top Gear, don't miss this one. (Note that Horizon Chase gives you five tracks for free. To unlock the rest, there's a single £2.29/US$2.99 IAP.)
Anyone expecting the kind of free-roaming racing from the console versions of this title are going to be miffed, but Need for Speed: Most Wanted is nonetheless one of the finest games of its kind on Android. Yes, the tracks are linear, with only the odd shortcut, but the actual racing bit is superb.
You belt along the seedy streets of a drab, gray city, trying to win events that will boost your ego and reputation alike. Wins swell your coffers, enabling you to buy new vehicles for entering special events.
The game looks gorgeous on Android and has a high-octane soundtrack to urge you onwards. But mostly, this one’s about the controls – a slick combination of responsive tilt and effortless drifting that makes everything feel closer to OutRun 2 than typically sub-optimal mobile racing fare.
The first two Riptide games had you zoom along undulating watery circuits surrounded by gleaming metal towers. Riptide GP: Renegade offers another slice of splashy futuristic racing, but this time finds you immersed in the seedy underbelly of the sport.
As with the previous games, you’re still piloting a hydrofoil, and racing involves not only going very, very fast, but also being a massive show-off at every available opportunity.
If you hit a ramp or wave that hurls you into the air, you’d best fling your ride about or do a handstand, in order to get turbo-boost on landing. Sensible racers get nothing.
The career mode finds you earning cash, upgrading your ride, and probably ignoring the slightly tiresome story bits. The racing, though, is superb – an exhilarating mix of old-school arcade thrills and modern mobile touchscreen smarts.
Mini Motor Racing is a frenetic top-down racer that finds tiny vehicles darting about claustrophobic circuits that twist and turn in a clear effort to have you repeatedly drive into walls. The cars handle more like remote control cars than real fare, meaning that races are typically tight – and easily lost if you glance away from the screen for just a moment.
There’s a ton of content here – many dozens of races set across a wide range of environments. You zoom through ruins, and scoot about beachside tracks. The AI’s sometimes a bit too aggressive, but with savvy car upgrades, and nitro boost usage when racing, you’ll be taking more than the occasional checkered flag.
Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit exists in a world where the police seem to think it’s perfectly okay to use their extremely expensive cars to ram fleeing criminals into submission. And when they’re not doing that, they belt along the streets, racing each other to (presumably) decide who pays for the day’s doughnuts.
It’s a fairly simple racer – you’re basically weaving your way through the landscape, smashing into other cars, and triggering the odd trap – but it’s exhilarating, breezy fun that echoes classic racers like Chase H.Q.
And once you’ve had your fill of being one of the nitro-happy fuzz, you can play out a career as the pursued as well, getting stuck into the kind of cop-smashing criminal antics that totally won’t be covered by your car manufacturer’s warranty.
Final Freeway 2R is a retro racing game, quite blatantly inspired by Sega’s classic OutRun. You belt along in a red car, tearing up a road where everyone’s rather suspiciously driving in the same direction. Every now and again, you hit a fork, allowing you to select your route. All the while, cheesy music blares out of your device’s speakers.
For old hands, you’ll be in a kind of gaming heaven. And arguably, this game’s better than the one that inspired it, feeling more fluid and nuanced. If you’re used to more realistic fare, give Final Freeway 2R a go – you might find yourself converted by its breezy attitude, colorful visuals, and need for truly insane speed.
Motorsport Manager Mobile 3 is a racing management game without the boring bits. Rather than sitting you in front of a glorified spreadsheet, the game is a well-balanced mix of accessibility and depth, enabling you to delve into the nitty gritty of teams, sponsors, mechanics, and even livery.
When you’re all set, you get to watch surprisingly tense and exciting top-down racing. (This being surprising because you’re largely watching numbered discs zoom around circuits.) One-off races give you a feel for things, but the real meat is starting from the bottom of the pile in the career mode, with the ultimate aim of becoming a winner.
It’s all streamlined, slick, and mobile-friendly, and a big leap on from the relatively simplistic original Motorsport Manager Mobile.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Presumably due to stock shortages
(Image credit: Intel)
Fed up of rebooted movies? Or remakes of old games? Creativity and originality are dead in contemporary culture, you say? Well we’re not sure how you’ll feel about the prospect of ancient processors rising from the silicon grave, but this is exactly what Intel has done with its latest move in the CPU arena.
Intel’s Pentium G3420 is a Haswell chip based on a 22nm process which was released back in Q3 of 2013, over six years ago now, but as Tom’s Hardware spotted, it has been resurrected and is now back on the chip giant’s roadmap.
In a product change notification document, Intel let customers know that: “Cancelling this Product Discontinuance completely per new roadmap decision and enabling the product long term once again.”
The dual-core Pentium processor, which has a base clock speed of 3.2GHz, will apparently be sold through to May 2020.
So what’s this all about then? Surely no one wants to buy an old and crusty Pentium which was first released six years ago?
Well, no, not in the consumer sphere anyway, but this chip is aimed at PC manufacturers (for use in cheap builds) and the likes of the embedded market and thin clients.
The reason it could have been brought back, as Tom’s Hardware theorizes, is perhaps to help cope with demand in such markets, given that Intel is struggling to make enough contemporary CPUs (and thus might need to fall back to an older process, to help pick up some of the slack).
We recently heard Intel apologize for these processor shortages, which have been ongoing for some time now, and are set to remain a problem.
Investing ‘record’ levels of capital to boost 14nm production throughout the course of 2019 simply hasn’t been enough, and we have previously heard that Intel has shifted to use 22nm on CPUs which are on the fringe to help deal with demand – and arguably that might be the case here.

(Image credit: Shutterstock)
We're still waiting for WhatsApp dark mode to arrive on our phones, but another long-awaited feature has finally arrived on Android handsets: call waiting.
As MSPowerUser explains, the new feature is so simple, you might be surprised it didn't already exist. Until now, if you were using WhatsApp to make a call and someone else tried to call you, they would hear an 'engaged' tone, but you wouldn't receive any kind of notification to tell you they were attempting to reach you.
With the new call waiting feature, you'll be able to see that someone else is trying to reach you, and accept the call if you want.
To use call waiting, simply ensure your app is updated to version 2.19.352 or later and it will be enabled automatically. You can find out which version you're using by long-pressing the app icon and scrolling down to the bottom. It may take a couple of days for the update to roll out worldwide.
Another feature arriving with this update is the long-awaited ability to stop strangers adding you to groups. This option was first discussed in April, but is only now being rolled out to Android users. 
If you enter the app's settings and select Settings > Account > Privacy > Groups, you should see three options that determine who can add you to a group. Selecting 'Nobody' will prevent anyone from adding you to a group unless you accept an invitation by private message, 'My contacts' will only allow people in your address group to add you to groups, and 'Anyone' will (you guessed it) let anybody add you to groups, including strangers.
The feature is intended to make it harder for spammers to add people to groups and bombard them with unwanted advertising or misleading information.
WhatsApp also claims to have fixed an issue that caused the app to drain battery power unusually quickly on some Android handsets. Of course, the forthcoming dark mode will also be a great way to make the app draw less juice, but there's still no word on when that will arrive. We'll keep you updated as soon as we know more.

Vivo’s vice president and general manager for the Chinese market, Liu Hong, just revealed some details about the upcoming Vivo X30 series at the Dongguan media communication meeting that took place in China today.
Liu Hong confirmed once again that Vivo’s X30 series will debut with the new Exynos 980; an “AI chip” jointly developed by Vivo and Samsung.
According to official reports, the Exynos 980 is the world ’s first mass-produced Cortex A77 architecture dual-mode 5G SoC. With more than 500 engineers employed in R&D by the Chinese phone maker. Additionally, the joint research and development time between the two companies has been of nearly 10 months; thus why the X30 series will be the first to equip the CPU.
Liu Hong also revealed that the Vivo X30 series is already being mass-produced; with a daily output close to 100,000 units. The X30 5G will be Vivo’s first dual-mode 5G phone and it will debut in the Chinese province Guilin on December 16th.
Samsung’s Exynos 980 CPU isn’t the only interesting piece of hardware we’ll find on the X30 series though. The smartphone will indeed also pack a periscope super telephoto lens, which supports up to 60x super zoom; plus we’ll find another dedicated portrait lens.
Finally, it’s worth reminding that the vivo X30 series will use a small-aperture punch-hole screen solution and will support under display fingerprint recognition. This is the first time that the X series adopts this type full-screen design, a trend that’s apparently getting more common.
Either way, in exactly a week we’ll learn more about the latest Vivo flagship; most importantly its retail price.

On December 6th, Nokia finally announced the much teased Nokia 2.3 entry-level phone. Today, the device went on pre-order in Russia with a price tag of 7990 Rubles, around $125 or 113€ at the current exchange rates.
As we can see on Nokia’s Russian official website, the Nokia 2.3 is available in all the color variants announced at lunch. Thus it’s possible to pick between Cyan Green, Sand and Charcoal. That said, the website does not show when the devices will actually be shipped. So, if you’re from Russia, you can probably wait a little longer before pre-ordering one.
Specs wise, the Nokia 2.3 comes with a 6.2-inch HD + 19: 9 screen; along with a waterdrop notch and In-Cell technology to improve the viewing experience. The smartphone is then powered by a low-end MediaTek Helio A22 CPU along with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD card).
While on the photography side, the handset features a 13MP main rear camera with LED flash and f/2.2 aperture paired with 2MP secondary camera. On the front we instead find a single 5MP front-facing camera with f/2.4 aperture.
Finally, Nokia’s 2.3 is powered by a 4000mAh capacity battery and runs Android 9.0 OTB (upgradable to Android 10).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alleged Samsung Galaxy S11 leaks in especially grainy hands-on images</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The very first hands-on image leak of the alleged Galaxy S11 has now surfaced, although you would be hard-pressed to work out just what you’re looking at given the quality of the leaked images.
Despite that, the upcoming flagship is visible even in a supposed ‘leakproof case’ due to that quite distinctive new camera layout that was showcased previously in CAD-based renders. Given the track record of leaker @IceUniverse, it’s highly likely that these grainy images are the real deal — albeit not exactly in the quality we had hoped.
It’s that interesting new camera layout that sort-of seals the deal, as there are no other devices that we know of coming with the domino rear camera layout.
It’s believed that the Galaxy S11 camera system could have some serious fire-power, with a 108-megapixel main sensor, impressive 5x zoom capabilities and may even be able to record video at a staggering 8K — thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 965 chipset. The rest of the specifications will no doubt entice, with a potential 5,000mAh battery also being added into the mix according to the same reports.
Beyond the camera array, there isn’t much else to glean from the pixelated hands-on images shared here. Along the top bezel, there appear to be some cutouts in the case, which could be for a SIM tray and some other microphones but, honestly, we’re just speculating at this point as no further details were given.
It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to expect more Galaxy S11 hands-on image leaks over the coming weeks, as is often the case, this could be the opening of Pandora’s box ahead of a deluge of new information. Given the quality, what do you hope for with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S11 in early 2020? Let us know down in the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Update: Now live] Google Opinion Rewards set to warn you when Play Store credits are expiring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Opinion Rewards app really is a great little way to receive free Play Store credits to go toward apps, games, music, and movies just for answering some simple surveys and questionnaires.
However, while the credits gifted by the Google Opinion Rewards app can be accumulated quite substantially, these credits expire one year after initially awarded. The biggest problem is that you get no formal warning of when your credit is set to disappear.
[Update 12/09]: Google is now rolling out the expiration dates for any previously earned credits within the Google Opinion Rewards app (via Android Police). The update seems to be server-side, meaning that it should be heading out over the coming days.
When you now fire up the Google Opinion Rewards app, you’ll see exactly when a specific portion of your credit is set to run out. As you’ll notice from the screenshot below, it’s nice and prominent, ensuring that you know just when you have to spend that specific allotted portion of your Play Store credit balance.
It’s also worth noting that the ‘Reward history’ section still doesn’t show individual expiry dates for your credit balance — which is still disappointing. At least it’s better than just seeing your Opinion Rewards balance dissipate without any warning.
 
According to posts on Reddit, some people have been receiving notifications to check their Opinion Rewards credit balance (via XDA-Developers). The original poster notes that they saw a quite substantial $63 disappear from their credit balance, which is especially strange, given that it would be almost impossible to earn an amount that large in just one day of answering surveys.
 
Google seems to be showing a message with a link to help center pages when you load up the Opinion Rewards app. The help center pages explain that Google is currently working on updates to help notify you when your credits are set to expire.
There is even an explanation for the major drop seen by posters over on Reddit. This appears to be because of bulk expiration of older Google Play Store credits. That still doesn’t explain why credit accumulation would reach those levels before being taken away.
You can view your current promotional credit balance within your Google Play Store wallet along with the expiration date underneath. It’s as easy as heading into the Play Store and selecting “Payment methods” from the side hamburger menu. Within the original Reddit post, several commenters are seeing the expiry date shift back when they make a purchase with their promotional balance.
Some are even stating that separately purchased gift card balances are disappearing — which is quite shocking. We’re sure that some clarification will come from Google regarding these balances in the coming days.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vivo today introduced a new mid-range smartphone in India, called the V17. Unlike the V17 that was launched in Russia last month, the Indian variant comes with a tiny hole-punch display and has an L-shaped quad camera array on the back.
The new Vivo V17 sports a 6.44-inch E3 Super AMOLED display with a tall 20:9 aspect ratio and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. Powering Vivo's latest mid-range smartphone for the Indian market is an 11nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage.
Vivo V17's L-shaped quad camera array includes a 48MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor for portrait shots. Housed within the tiny hole-punch cutout on top of the phone's display is a 32MP selfie camera.

Keeping the lights on is a 4,500mAh battery, with support for the company's 18W Dual-Engine fast charging technology. The Vivo V17 also features an optical in-display fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the software front, it runs on Android 9.0 Pie OS with Vivo's Funtouch OS 9.2 on top.
Vivo V17 will be going on sale in India starting December 17 for ₹22,990 ($323) via major e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and the company's own e-store in Glacier Ice White and Midnight Black colors. It will also be available from major offline retailers across the country. Until December 31, Vivo is offering a 5% cashback on purchases made using HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank credit cards.

After recording it, we turned the social media moment into an advertisement for the book which was then shared on social media and got folks to buy my new book. The reason that throwing around perfectly good pasta drove book sales? It has everything to do with my five step model for success on social media. (And a tiny little bit to do with people's love of pasta.)
Content is queen, and the content for effective social media marketing comes from a clear brand story. Once you figure out what your clear story is, then it's time to actually go about telling it on social media.
Think of your social media account like a bank account. The cardinal rule of bank accounts? Deposit more than you withdraw. On social media, that means you want to follow the 80-20 rule. Make sure to always spend 80 percent of your time depositing value in the form of the original or curated content you share, like articles, quotations, statistics, testimonials, direct calls to action, transitional calls to action, impactful images, selfies, videos, etc. Then, 20 percent of the time call your social media followers to action by asking them to sign up for your newsletter, buy your product, or tell a friend about your awesomeness.
The most important thing you need to know when it comes to how to post on social media is which platform to focus on. Not all platforms work for all brands, and one of the biggest mistakes people make is to spend all their time on a platform that simply doesn't work for their audience or customers.
Once you know what your priority social media platform is, then it's time to create a social media schedule and social media editorial calendar that works for your audience and your brand's bandwidth.
Your brand is not your hero, your customer is. That means that your customer (or potential customer) is your follower. Reframe your social media account to make it about them.
One great way to do that is by generating empathy, and thus engagement. My favorite tips to do so? Help someone out on social media or ask a question. And remember, don't post and ghost; great social media marketing requires real-time connection and engagement with your audience.
It doesn't matter how many times Facebook changes its algorithm, one thing will always be true: Social media companies will always reward engaged accounts with greater reach. That means that your goal should always be to focus on engaging with your existing social media tribe in order to expand the ultimate reach of your posts, and not on chasing new followers with the latest social media trick.
Here are a few ways to do this. First, craft a killer social media profile that increases your authority. Next, remember that great hashtags can put great content on steroids. When crafting a hashtag, be as general as you can without using a term people already associate with something else. Finally, remember that influencer marketing, when used wisely, can posts go further.
The real-time nature of social media means that you never know what's going to happen. Make that a good thing and learn to roll with the social media punches. If your brand makes a social media mistake, own up to it. Fast.
In terms of low hanging fruit, remember that social media gives your customers a public place to share their grievances, and sometimes they will do just that. If the comments aren't offensive, let the dialogue take place, and don't delete the negative content. Then, try to turn a negative conversation into a positive one.
And what happens if things get really bad? Take a cue from the American Red Cross, who managed to mistakenly send out a drunken tweet, and yet by handling the situation with grace, humor, and transparency, to actually raise donations in the process.
Ultimately, social media is the most ubiquitous, and least expensive marketing tool your brand has, and learning to use it well to drive sales is one of the best uses of your marketing time. Don't waste time throwing spaghetti media marketing spaghetti around with abandon, however. Get a plan for social media success.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!
Ahh, December. On one hand, it’s a terrible month. It’s cold, it’s dark, it rains all the fucking time — it’s pretty grim when you think about it. But, on the other, it’s glorious.
There’s a festive cheer in the air, holidays are on the horizon, and people actually seem to want to meet up and have fun. And then you have the indulgences. My god, the indulgences.
The drink flows. Food’s everywhere. I’m salivating just thinking about it. It’s magnificent.
But… it can be too easy to go a bit too hard. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t eat that seventh turkey sandwich of the day, but maybe you could go for a little jog to help burn it off?
“Sounds good, but how can I motivate myself to do this?” I hear you ask.
Well, I’ve got a solution for you: a Fibit Versa 2 smartwatch. Oh — and would you believe it? — there’s currently $70 off this device! That means you can pick up the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch for only $130, instead of the $200 it normally costs.
Want some info? Well, first off, why don’t you have a look at this video from Fitbit:
As you’d expect from a device from Fitbit, the Versa 2 has all the health tracking features you could want. It can measure your heart rate, get real-time readouts on your activities, track your sleep, and more. Hell, you can ever swim with this thing!
But it’s the range of other features that really makes the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch such a steal for $130. Beyond all its health-tracking capabilities, it’s also a rather handy, uh, smartwatch.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new Crash Bandicoot may be announced very soon, as some recent happenings suggest.
YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh spotted several influencers posting photos of a figurine from the Crash Bandicoot series they have received recently. Last year, something similar happened right before the announcement of Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, so it is very likely that an announcement related to the series is coming at The Game Awards or even earlier during this week's State of Play from Sony.
Red Dead Redemption 2 New Mod Allows Changes To Difficulty
The latest entry in the series to be released on consoles is the already mentioned Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled. The game doesn't break any new ground, but it does a great job of updating the formula.
A new Crash Bandicoot game has yet to be announced officially. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Android, Google and free content licenses. Who is to blame and what can be done?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Have you heard about bans on apps and developers in Google Play? This is just such a story. It’s also an attempt to collect similar cases into one place and offer some kind of plan of action to prevent Google’s unpredictable actions. It isn’t fair to be banned for the legal use of free material. Personally, I like the idea of content licenses such as CC BY-SA, which permits any use, including commercial. Thanks to such licenses, we developers have websites like StackOverflow, where I’ve been elected to be the moderator. Unfortunately, companies like Google don’t respect the ideas behind these licenses. Here's my story.
It all started out fine. Our app for Android was created back in 2014 and had been living quite a normal life on Google Play. The app was a client to a site with texts. Nothing special, but people liked it, especially the option to download texts to the device and read them without the Internet. The app took the texts from http://scpfoundation.net/. It’s a website for joint literary creativity within a common fictional universe, quite well-known in some circles. Originally it appeared in the US (http://www.scp-wiki.net).Then their community translated thousands of articles from English into over 10 other languages. For posterity, it is important that all the content on the sites, the original and the translated ones, is distributed under a free Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which is located at the bottom of each page. This also applies to the logo of the website indicating the license, as seen here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SCP_Foundation_ (emblem).svg on Wikipedia. The license permits any use of the material, including for commercial purposes, requiring only the indication of authorship and preservation of the original license in derivative works. This information, the source of the texts with license indication, was in both the description of the apps and in the apps themselves.
For several years everything was running normally. Initially, it was decided to make all the features of the app free and to provide the possibility of voluntary donations through in-app subscriptions. However, it hardly brought in any profit at all. As a result, it was decided to monetize the most popular features of the app, compensating for the inconvenience to users by opening the source code. We also started to release versions for languages other than Russian. The original Russian version of the app even got into the top 10 of the "news and magazines" category of Google Play. While working on this project, I sort of taught myself programming, I tried new things, I made mistakes and I learned a lot. The important thing for this article is the development process. It was necessary to parse HTML on the server and then send it through API to all the sites with translations, instead of doing a separate app for each language with parsing on the client. I know this now, but 5 years ago I had very little idea of how to write servers. At the time, it didn't make much sense to me. My thinking was that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Now I write API and plan to go onto iOS and hopefully one day return to Google Play.
Then the warning lights started flashing, one after another. First Google Play began to reject new apps for copyright infringement. It was the same code, but for a site in a different language. I believe the new versions started to get rejected in the summer of 2017. However, each time it was possible to solve the issue by contacting their technical support service, which even suggested a special form, in which you can notify Google of the release of a new app by sending them any files needed. In my case, all I had to do was provide a link to the website and state that there was a license at the bottom that allowed the use of the content. After that, Google sent a letter saying that everything was okay. We were free to spread it and they had saved our information. But apps also got deleted (I’ll talk later about the difference between removal and blocking).They’d be deleted for things like mentioning the names of other apps in the description, in particular, the name of one of the games based on the site. In theory, the license should allow it. But okay, I'm not a lawyer, maybe Google was right, and we just had to clean up what they didn’t like and move on. But then they started removing apps due to the lack of privacy policy and processing of personal data. We were not alone in this situation. The problem was extensive. It seemed to have started around 2018.The network had several generators with such agreements, which were just enough to put on the website and add a link to the description of the app. Then there was Appodeal, where the app was removed due to problems in their SDK. But my mistake was that I had used the beta version, and Appodeal honestly warned about this problem the day before removal. I just had to update the SDK to the latest stable version, but I didn’t manage to up it in time.
Then things started going wrong with Google Play’s app checks. I tried to release an update with a new version of Appodeal SDK. It was rejected for the same reason. On reflection, I decided that it was easier to just remove SDK, replacing its functionality (it was used for advertising with rewards) with similar functions from AdMob. Do you think it helped? I don’t think so! This update was also rejected. But I'm a programmer. I'm cunning. I bypassed this bug on Google Play simply and gracefully. I posted an update in the form of an alpha version and raised it to the working version. And everything was fine. For a while.
Then there was the time that our apps were removed because of violations of their advertising rules. As always, no examples, just a link to the voluminous rules for developers. After talking with their technical support service, I managed to find out that Google saw a problem with the links to my other apps in Google Play, which was just a list of similar apps in other languages. I mean, come on, I can’t give links to my own apps on the same platform? Okay Google, if you want it that bad. Here you go. I released an update with "Ad " over each button-link. Problem solved.
Then I got a letter stating, "After a recent review, SCP Foundation France On/Offline database fr (ru.dante.scpfoundation.fr) has been removed from Google Play." The French version of the app got banned. The reason given was, of all things, "Violation of Sexually Explicit Content policy." And again, nothing was said about what exactly Google had found objectionable. Perhaps, if you search really thoroughly amongst the thousands of texts, you might have found a couple of provocative images. Well, I didn’t lose heart. Google probably knows what it's doing and I'm the one to blame. I put up with the loss of the app. It had a few users, but its loss didn’t set us back too much. I began to update the rest of the apps, disabling of all images. At the same time, I began to look for information on app bans on the Internet. And then I started to suspect that this was not an accident. I wasn’t the only one in this situation. It turned out that the network has many examples of app bans and even accounts bans.
Let’s digress and talk about the moderation system in Google Play. There are two or three types of sanctions against apps, depending on what you count. First, your app can be "Removed." In this case, the app will not be available for search and download on Google Play, but you have access to it in the developer console and can release an update with fixes. This is not considered a serious violation and does not affect the status of the account. A subset of this is “Update Rejection.” In this case, the app is available for search and installation through Google Play, however, you should make changes to the planned update, as it violates something — something in the current form. Like in the first case, it does not affect the status of the account and nothing threatens you except for spoiling the mood and having some extra work to do. The last type of sanction is really bad. It’s called "Suspended" and if you see a letter from Google with this word, prepare for the worst. The app isn’t just removed from Google Play, it’s removed permanently, with a ban on updating and even viewing the description, statistics and reviews in the developer console. The scary thing here isn’t that Google makes you release a new version with a new package and re-recruit users, reviews, paying audience and explain to the users of the deleted version why everything stopped working. The scary thing is that you’ve got a label on you and the timer has started. Now you are an unreliable developer. Some people say that strikes get "rotten" after about six months. If get two more "Suspended " apps, you automatically cease to be an independent Android developer forever. Google explicitly prohibits the creation of a new developer account after the ban of the existing one and, given the market share of Google Play, the ban deprives the developer of a lot market access.
Okay, back to the main plot. About three weeks later after the aforementioned app bans, I was at another meetup listening to some reports. And then I get two messages from Google. That's right, two more apps were banned. But this time, the two main ones, the Russian and the English versions. My first thought was, "Damn, I didn’t have time to release the update with the pictures disabled." But that wasn’t the reason. Here is a quote from the letter: "After review, SCP Foundation EN Database On / Offline, ru.dante.scpfoundation.eng, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a strike policy because it violates the impersonation policy." In other words, Google decided that I was impersonating another person and using someone else's brand without permission. And here's the weird thing, all apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name were removed from the store. Except the ones I posted later, notifying Google of a free content license through the form I mentioned above. And not only were my apps removed, but other developers' apps were as well, about ten or more. I didn’t count them at the time, so I don’t know how many were removed and how many developers discovered that years of their work were thrown into a landfill by Google and their robots. Now you can’t find any apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name in Google Play, which implies that none of them managed to resolve the situation with Google.
In this case, I immediately issued appeals for both apps. I wrote that the apps use content under a free license and gave them links to the site where this is clearly written. However, in response, they wrote the following:
That means that they want me to provide them with documents confirming my right to use the content and the brand, as I understand it, both the name and the icon. They also needed the documents in the form of a response to this letter from the mail server of the site. In addition, for the Russian and English versions, they had two different domains in mind, one of which is a mirror of the second, although the Russian version did not take anything at all from these sites. They didn’t care about the presence of a free license for content that allows its use, as they never even mentioning it. Although in other apps it was enough, going by the fact that other similar apps have not been removed. Okay Google, I tried to comply with this requirement of yours. I went on scp-wiki.net’s private messaging system(like other sites with translations, it works on the Wikidot engine) and I wrote to other local administrators dealing with issues related to their content licenses. In the “Help” section of the site, it was written that they answer within a day. The first admin didn't answer me, I wrote the other one, then another, then another. I was answered by deathly silence. But I didn’t give up. Although the first panic attacks began to occur, I still hoped for a solution to the problem within a week or two. Thinking about how many subscriptions to users would be canceled in this time, I browsed the net looking for information on how to make a document that the site administrators can send to Google. It looked like this. Meanwhile, I wrote a newsletter to our users through FCM, describing the situation. With that, I built a simple page on the site.
One more digression. Let me tell you about the recent scandal in the SCP Foundation community related to content licensing, copyrights, threats, revelations and other things. I don’t know if this stems from blocking apps. I’ll just give you a list of facts and you can draw your own conclusions. It went more or less like this:
I know this individual. We’d worked together for some time, mutually advertising his artbooks and our app. But at one point we had a misunderstanding about the details of our agreement which resulted in a rather unpleasant conversation. Fortunately, we managed to resolve it. However during the conversation there were direct threats to remove the apps from the Google store due to the use of the TM.
This case was in December 2018. And blocking all apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name occurred at the end of March. After two weeks, my developer account was blocked. Apparently, this was due to the fact that I had not received a response from the administrators of the English site and already had had three strikes on the account. The next day, the owner of the TM presented his own analogue version of our app. Everything seemed to check out and the reason for the block was clear. However, in a personal conversation with the owner of the TM, he denied my assumptions about his involvement and announced his intention to withdraw the TM. Google also refused to confirm my suspicions, ignoring my questions to technical support about any claims of copyright holders and the name and logo of the apps, insisting on the connection with the original site. You can decide if there is any connection.
Update: After I started writing this article, the situation with the TM has worsened. He began to block communities in VK with its help and withdrew board games from the market. The administrators of the Russian site released a post explaining the situation and reporting that the court documents for the app were almost ready. They were also supported by the original website, which started collecting donations for legal expenses. As a result, the site administrators wrote a statement to the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. It’s also worth mentioning the position of the technical support service of VK: they completely ignored any indication of the license and ban on the communities.
But let’s get back to Google. At some point I realized that there was only one way to win back the account and apps and that was to contact the admins of the original site and ask them to send an email with the ready-made document. Nothing could be easier, right? Initially, I had my doubts. Going by what I had known about the site and its administration system, they might not have their own mail server or even a desire to help me. But those were only my fears. And the task was so simple. I just had to contact them. But that turned out to be the biggest problem. No one answered my personal messages. And when one of the admins did finally answer, he said that he was busy and would answer later. Four (!) months later, I managed to get through to the administration, which said that I was not alone in this predicament. They have tried to help others with this and failed. Google just doesn't want to hear them. And they do not have their own mail server, so there is no technical possibility to send the letter I need. So the circle has been closed.
Is this an isolated case? As I’ve mentioned above, no, it’s not. You can see for yourself by searching the web or visiting my website (https://dont-play-with-google.com/). I created it specifically to collect articles about cases of blocking apps and accounts in Google Play. Some of the articles on the site were translated into Russian, English and French with the help of my friends. Keep in mind that we are not professional translators and many articles are translated automatically and only slightly corrected. It is also possible to add new articles and translations into other languages. If you have links to other blocking cases, please, add them to the site as people should know. If you want to help the site, you can translate articles, correct typos or just code. The site consists of server and client sections. BackEnd is made on Spring (Gradle, Kotlin, Postgresql): https://github.com/mohaxspb/dont-play-with-gp-api. FrontEnd — Angular (TypeScript): https://github.com/mohaxspb/dont-play-with-gp-front. Don’t judge the code too harshly as I specialize on Android. It's funny that in the process of creating the site I even had to edit the Angular compiler (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32760). PullRequests are welcomed on any subject either bugs or new opportunities. The list of tasks for the site’s functionality can be found in Trello.
Here are just a few examples of absurd app and account bans:
In all these cases, the bans occur suddenly. The developer doesn’t receive any warnings. In many cases, one can avoid getting their ban apps or accounts banned simply by changing one line in the name of the app (as in my case) or the name of the account (as in a case from the list above). However, instead of a warning with a proposal to correct the violation, you’re just banned. And technical support either doesn’t want to help you or demands unnecessary documents. I even had a case in which an automatic email from Google about a problem with the app contained broken links. Also, there are never any specifics in automatic letters, only the indication of the violated point of very vague rules and a reference to these rules. To at least get some hint to the cause of the ban, you need to contact the technical support service. And it doesn’t always give any details, like in the case of the ban of the associated account, thereby depriving you of any opportunity to do something. Here’s another example. A person got three bans on their app, all automatic. The first two bans were later canceled by technical support due to lack of violations, but the third ban appears not to be canceled.
The worst part is that there is absolutely no way to talk to a real person, only through forms with a promise of a response by mail within 72 hours. And the mail is rumored to be answered by outsourcers from India. I've no problem with that, but as for the quality of the technical support service, I think I’ve already said enough. Compare this with Google Ads technical support. They’re on the phone, in your native language, and they’ll tell you that you need to put a comma in the text and lower the age rating. And they’ll call back from a personal mobile number to check up on you. "Is your ad okay now?" I had the opportunity to compare the Google Play service and Google Ads. It's like night and day. But how did it happen? And does Google know about this issue?
Of course they do. They even have special webinars for developers to clarify the details of the moderation system, complete with tips on how to avoid getting banned. And they conduct them in the developer’s native language. And they announce these webinars on major IT resources like habr.com, the largest Russian-language IT resource. However, if you look at the recording of the webinar, you’ll find that it was just someone reading a printout of the info available in Google Help. The Q&A was also just people reading from papers, with pre-prepared answers for prepared questions. It was all just to check a box. Google does not have any real desire to help developers. The video of the webinar has already been removed. It was here. There was also a chat in which dozens of developers, including me, tried to ask questions about blocks on our accounts and apps. We were answered with links to their rules. We were so upset, we tried to organize a Telegram chat. If you are interested in talking to colleagues about similar unfortunate events, welcome to our chat: https://t.me/android_developers_ban.
On the other hand, in local markets, Google is trying to convince everyone how amazingly organized they are at helping developers launch, distributing and support apps. For example, you read about how well everything is organized. Google Play is constantly in touch, always willing to help with advice on any matter. Help with promotion, help in general, whatever you need. It’s not just any old technical support, it’s a waking dream. But when people went to the comments section and asked how to get this access in Google Play, they were all ignored. Obviously, it was just a promotional article designed to draw developers into the store.
How did it happen that the app store, which once allowed anyone put up any app of any quality without being afraid of it getting banned, has now turned into a place where you’re terrified to post an update or even have the app on your account. Some say that bots check and can ban even unpublished apps. And you can’t delete them if someone has the app installed. There are several reasons for that, as far as I understand:
My friends told me about companies involved in the creation of apps that just embed WebView, in order to redirect advertising traffic to users. Their only goal is to push their app in the store, one way or another, and earn at least some money. If the account is blocked, they simply switch to another one. They have a lot of tools to hide their digital tracks. They can avoid bans for linked accounts and there’s even a market for selling developer accounts formed around them. It’s clear that such abuses can be fought only with the help of robots. But the wrongdoers don’t get punished, they just buy a new account for a few dollars. While ordinary developers suffer from friendly fire and lose their apps forever. Their apps are often their only source of income. But maybe these are unavoidable losses. It’s just the unavoidable result of the reliable security we enjoy on Google Play. Unfortunately, no. There’s constantly news about dozens of new malwares, viruses and other things popping up. Google can't keep users or developers safe.
What conclusion can be drawn from all this? I’m sorry to say it, especially after so many years, but my conclusion seems to be that you can no longer consider Google Play to be a reliable platform for publishing apps. Or even as a platform where you can count on a reliable source of income. And the worst part is that there are simply no alternatives, unless you publish in China where Google is banned. And after your account is deleted, you might not be able to continue earning ad revenue while you're trying to recover it; unless, of course, as per Google’s advice, you use their advertising SDK from AdMob. As soon as your app and/or account is banned, advertising in AdMob immediately becomes disabled. And it doesn't work the other way around. If you manage to restore the app/account you will have to write to AdMob technical support to restore the advertising display. You can use other advertising SDKs, but with new risks. I’ve already described a case of the failure in Google Play due to the availability of the SDK from Appodeal. The latter, by the way, also requires an account in AdMob and an app in Google Play and will seriously limit the display of ads or disable them altogether in case of problems with Google.
As you can see, if you are going to build a serious business with distribution through Google Play, you need to be prepared for the fact that you might suddenly lose it all and your only hope is a possible hype in the media. Or you need to be a company the size of Facebook, then you will have the phone number of a manager at Google and you’ll be able to solve any problem quickly and easily. And you won’t be banned for the nude photos of your app users which they placed there themselves. But if you are not Facebook, you’ll just be banned, because you violated the rules. And in this case, the developers managed to restore the app. After 3 months! But we all know that such a situation simply doesn’t happen to large companies. As indicated in the first link, the ban was for a picture which was considered too racy for Google Play. However, the developers found the exact same picture in Twitch and other big apps. That means the rules are not only vague, but also do not apply to everyone. Some developers are “more equal” than others.
So, can we improve the situation? I don’t think we can. Google is a commercial company and their goal is to make money. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. But it means that the company will try to reduce costs and increase profits. And try to avoid lawsuits. As a result, it is easier and cheaper for them to ban apps and developers automatically than to hire a huge number of specialists who will personally understand the nuances and view each app, especially since, most likely, a very small percentage of developers and apps give the bulk of the revenue to Google Play. I have not seen detailed statistics on this topic, but I think it is unlikely that the situation here is very different from the situation with another Google service: YouTube. According to this study from Pex only 0.64% of videos get more than 100,000 views. And those videos generate 81.6% of all platform views. And since videos with a small number of views do not meet the criteria for enabling monetization, YouTube can remove 99% of all videos with almost no loss in profits and significantly reducing the cost of infrastructure for their storage. Moreover, at the time of writing YouTube plans to include a clause in their rules on December 10th, 2019, in which a user can be banned if he does not make a profit. "YouTube may terminate your access to or access through your Google account to all or part of the Service if it considers that providing you with access to the Service no longer makes commercial sense." I’m sure the same situation exists in Google Play. This way they can ban 99% of developers and apps and even increase profits.And don’t even dream that the situation with technical support is better on YouTube. It’s the same story. Automatic bans, unsubscribed by bots, inability to talk to a real tech support person. Unless of course you’re one of the few who rake in significant profits for the service.
Is there any way to fix the situation? I'm not sure that's possible. Because it’s more profitable for Google to leave the situation as it is than to spend huge amounts on a solution. It seems that we developers affected by Google bots can only write articles about it over and over again, hoping that someone at Google will read and manually restore our app or account. I think you shouldn’t discount the thought that developers could unite and act as a united front to change the situation. People are wired this way. They think about such solutions when so many people face the same problem. Since I began to develop for Android, I had read articles about bans, but of course, I never thought that this would happen to me. I'm not a spammer. I don’t write viruses and in general, I am always ready to wait on Google hand and foot. And I didn’t think I would lose everything because I didn’t change one word in the name of an app, especially since the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License permits it, as far as I understand. At least I successfully uploaded two of my ten apps to the Amazon store and they didn't have any questions about them.
Here’s a list of what I think any developer should do to minimize the damage from apps and accounts getting blocked. Not to avoid the damage, but to reduce it, because no one will warn you that the Google algorithm has found a problem.
Also, I would add to this list my thoughts on how the situation could be improved by creating competition. A while back Google was obliged to provide a choice of search engine at the first Android launch. It would be logical to oblige Google to also offer a choice of app store. Competition could emerge this way and, perhaps, Google would start to provide technical support on the phone (like in Russia, where Google has a strong competitor, Yandex) and stop automatic bans and let bots only be used for giving advice to moderators. Many problems could also be solved by changing the practice of banning without warning, so that the developer has the opportunity to fix something. Sometimes it is enough to change one word in the title to stay in good standing with the Google Play moderation system.
I don’t really believe I can do anything alone to improve the situation, but I won’t forgive myself if I didn’t try something, such as writing this article. Not expecting much, I sent an appeal to the FAS, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. Please note, I am not a lawyer or a writer. I'm a programmer. So my application must be rather informal and generally naive, because it seems only the state can protect developers from Google.
If you are also not satisfied with the current situation, please do the same. I am sure that things will improve if the app market on Android gets healthy competition between stores.
And finally, I would like to try to reach out to Google (in case someone from the company reads this article) and ask them to do something. For example:
I would be very happy if Google restored my apps and account, because I’ve invested a lot of work in them for more than five years. I hope at least someone will hear me. I hope that one day Google will be able to configure the moderation system so that developers will be safe from the situation when one day they find that themselves thrown out of the market by some program by a ridiculous mistake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA shown in design sketches ahead of this week's debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mercedes-Benz published a design sketch on its social media channels to preview the second-generation GLA crossover. The model is scheduled to make its debut online on December 11.
The sketch picks up where the last batch of teaser images left off. Don't pay attention to the huge wheels; they're not headed to production. The rest looks fairly accurate. The next GLA is taller and more SUV-like than the outgoing model, it's about half an inch shorter, and it looks like it's better proportioned. While we haven't seen the front end yet, earlier spy shots suggest it wears a sharper design. It falls in line with the design language seen recently on the firm's other compacts.
The similarities continue inside. In a separate post, Mercedes released an image that shows part of the model's cockpit. The air vents, the digital instrument cluster, and the steering wheel are the same units you'll find inside the firm's other compacts. The MBUX infotainment system will be offered, too.
The GLA shares more than styling cues and interior parts with the second-generation CLA, the first A-Class sedan, the seven-seater GLB, and the minivan-esque B-Class sold in Europe. All of these models ride on a front-wheel drive architecture that can be upgraded with 4Matic all-wheel drive. Like most of its siblings, the GLA will get a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder as its entry-level engine. Mercedes will add more powerful turbo fours (including a 416-horsepower unit that will power the flagship GLA 45), and a plug-in hybrid model could join the range a few years into the production run.
The next GLA will break cover on the Mercedes Me media platform the firm launched in 2017 at 2 p.m. CET on Dec. 11, which is 8 a.m. in New York and 5 a.m. in Los Angeles. It will be the first time Mercedes introduces a car exclusively online. There won't be an unveiling event organized for the media, and executives purposely chose to step well out of the auto show circuit. It's a move that saves a significant amount of money while drawing attention to the Mercedes Me platform.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BySean- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
Redmi will be holding the launch event for the Redmi K30 series tomorrow, 10th December 2019. It is not strictly a smartphone conference and will also feature the new products from the company like its new notebook computer, RedmiBook. However, prior to the official announcement, the live images of the RedmiBook have already surfaced online.
According to the images, we can observe the design of the RedmiBook. The yet to be announced notebook features minimal bezels on surrounding the screen with a high screen to body ratio. Furthermore, RedmiBook is a relatively small laptop with a screen size closer to 13-inches. It is no surprise considering it was labeled as a “lightweight player” by the Xiaomi subsidiary, although larger variants might also be announced.
Under the hood, the RedmiBook is confirmed to arrive with top notch specifications. This includes the Intel Core i7 processor of the latest 10th Generation which features a maximum core frequency of 4.9GHz. For graphics, it will feature NVIDIA‘s MX250 graphics card with 2GB of VRAM that is great for gaming and productivity purposes. In other words, the specs show that it is a capable ultrabook.
Previously, we had reported on a new RedmiBook 13 laptop being launched on 12th December 2019, and these might be the same notebook in question. Notably, the company has already launched the 15.6 inch and 14 inch models which also featured similar specs with 10th Gen Intel processors. Lastly, the 14 inch Enhanced Edition carried a price tag of 3,299 Yuan, so the 13 inch model is could be priced similarly or lower than its larger variant.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BySimranpal Singh- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
Oppo’s sub-brand – Realme recently unveiled Realme X2 Pro featuring Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset and a high-end Super AMOLED display. Realme made an entry into an affordable premium smartphone market with the Realme X2 Pro. It is set to compete against the OnePlus 7T Pro and Redmi K20 Pro. Apart from the hardware specs, the third-party development has also become a reason before buying a smartphone. In today’s article, we will guide users to unlock the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro easily (RMX1931).
Unlocking the bootloader of any Android smartphone is like a window to unlimited customizations. It opens doors to rooting the device and installing third-party recovery like TWRP. However, bootloader unlocking will void the warranty of your device. It is always recommended to follow the instructions carefully. Otherwise, you will end up with a bricked device. The Bootloader can also be relocked if it is not needed anymore.
The Realme X2 Pro is the company’s maiden premium flagship smartphone featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset coupled with Adreno 640 GPU. It is available in different storage variants including a 6GB + 64GB, 8GB + 128GB and 12GB + 256GB UFS 3.0 internal storage.
The smartphones feature a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED 90Hz refresh rate display having the resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. Moreover, its display supports 1000 nits maximum brightness level and supports HDR 10+. The device is encased in an aluminium frame and comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect against the frequent falls.
In optics, the Realme X2 Pro comes with a quad-camera module featuring a 64-MP primary camera, an 8-MP ultra-wide lens, a 13-MP telephoto lens, and a 2-MP depth sensor. There’s a 16-MP selfie camera on the front having an f/2.0 aperture for video calling.
The smartphone is backed by a 4000 mAh battery with 65W Super VOOC Flash Charge fast charging technology. There’s an in-display fingerprint sensor along with an accelerometer, proximity, gyroscope, and compass sensor.
You can follow our simple guide below to unlock the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro.
Note: GizmoChina.com is not responsible for any damage to smartphone and data while unlocking the bootloader. The process will void your warranty.
Note: Widevine L3 will replace Widevine L1, and the fingerprint sensor will stop working until the bootloader is locked again.
We hope you have successfully unlocked the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro. If you have any glitch while performing the above tasks, then make sure to comment below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ByHabeeb Onawole- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
Xiaomi had an event today in Japan to mark its official entry into the island nation. The Chinese tech giant was supposed to launch in the country next year but decided to make it early. At the event today, Xiaomi announced five products including the Mi Note 10 series, the Mi Smart Band 4, Mi Power Bank 3
The Mi Note 10 series are the only smartphones Xiaomi announced at the event today. The Mi Note 10 (6GB + 128GB) has a price tag of JPY 52,800 (~$489) excluding tax while the Mi Note 10 Pro (8GB + 256GB) will sell for JPY 64,800 (~$597) excluding tax. Both phones will be sold by Amazon Japan. Pre-order starts today for the two devices but the Mi Note 10 will go on sale on December 16 while the Mi Note 10 Pro will go on sale on December 23.
The Mi Note 10 has a 6.47-inch AMOLED FHD+ display with a waterdrop notch and Gorilla Glass 5. It is powered by the Snapdragon 730G processor and packs a 5260mAh battery with support for 30W fast charging that allows you to charge the device from empty to full in just 65 minutes.
The phone has a 32MP selfie camera and a 108MP penta-camera setup on the back. The primary sensor is paired with a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, another 5MP 5x optical zoom camera, a 20MP ultrawide angle camera, and a 2MP macro camera. There is NFC, Bluetooth 5.0, dual SIM support, an audio jack, a USB Type-C port, and an in-display fingerprint scanner.
The Mi Note 10 Pro has nearly the same specs but its 108MP camera has an 8P lens and not a 7P lens like the standard version. It also has more RAM and storage.
The Mi Smart Band 4 is Xiaomi’s latest fitness tracker and it has made its way to Japan. The Mi Smart Band 4 will be sold for JPY 3490 (~$32) excluding tax by Amazon Japan. Pre-orders begin today while sale begins on December 23.
The Mi Power Bank 3 10000mah version brings 18W fast charging support for JPY 1899 (~$18) excluding tax. The power bank will be available in blue and silver and sold by Amazon but there is no mention of when it will be available for purchase.
Mi Power Bank 3 10000mAh Japanese version
The Mi Power 3 10000mAh is different from the one that launched in China early this year. The one sold in Japan has two full-size USB output ports rather than one. Its USB Type-C port is also only an input port, not a 2-way port. The power button is also a circle and no pill-shaped. You still get a MicroUSB port.
Xiaomi says the power bank is also allowed on flights.
Rice is a pretty popular food in Japan, so it is a smart move for Xiaomi to launch its Mi IH Rice Cooker in the market. This is a smart home product, so it works with the Mi Home App.
The rice cooker will sell for JPY 9,999 (~$92) excluding tax. There is no info on availability.
If you are a frequent traveler, then Xiaomi’s Mi Luggage will surely interest you. It will be available in Japan in two versions: a metal version with an aviation-grade aluminum body and a JPY 17,990 price tag and a more affordable JPY 7990 (~$74) version made of Makrolon. These suitcases will also be sold by Amazon.
The metal version comes in silver while the Makrolon version is available in blue, gray, and black. Both are 20-inch suitcases with TSA approved locks and adjustable handles.
Xiaomi also had the Mi MIX Alpha on display at the event but it was in a sealed box and could not be touched. Surprisingly, no Redmi products were announced at the event.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meet The McLaren 620R: The Most Powerful Sports Series Yet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you thought the McLaren 600LT was the most hardcore Sports Series model, wait until you see the new McLaren 620R. Based on the track-only 570S GT4, the McLaren 620R is essentially a GT4 race car for the road, offering motorsport credentials in a road-legal package. McLaren describes the 620R as the "most track-focused, track-ready but roadgoing McLaren Sports Series model." It was built to celebrate the success of the 570S GT4 customer race car, which is the most successful GT car built by McLaren with more race wins and podiums than any other to date since debuting in 2017.
The McLaren 620R looks like a race car, handles like a race car, performs like a race car and feels like a race car, resulting in a seamless transition from race to road and vice versa. It shares the same lightweight single-piece carbon fiber Monocell II chassis as the 570S GT4, with a targeted dry weight of 2,826 pounds. Adjustable aerodynamic elements, race-derived suspension components, and powertrain recalibration to increase power and performance further enhance the 620R's dynamics.
Powering the 620R is the same 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the GT4 car, but with significantly more power. Since the car isn't restricted by racing regulations, the engine ECU and turbocharger management have been reconfigured to produce 610 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque, making the 620R the most powerful Sports Series car yet. This enables the 620R to hit 0-62 mph in 2.9 seconds and 0-124 mph in 8.1 seconds before maxing out at 200 mph.
Power is sent through a seven-speed Seamless Shift Gearbox with super-fast shift times ideal for setting blistering lap times. For added drama on the road, selecting Sport mode allows the driver to hear the upshift 'crack' created by a split-second cut of the ignition spark during a gearshift.
Other motorsport components derived from the 570S GT4 include two-way manually adjustable coilover dampers, which feature 32 clicks of adjustment per corner to allow a driver to tailor compression and rebound rates to suit their driving style and track conditions and is 13.2 pounds lighter than the regular Sports Series units. The suspension also features lightweight aluminum wishbones and uprights and stiffer anti-roll bars and springs than those fitted on a regular Sports Series model.
The rubber top mounts have been replaced with solid stainless-steel alternatives resulting in "noticeable improvements" in steering control and feedback. An adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing raised 12.5 inches into the cleaner airflow above the vehicle increases downforce while minimizing drag, which is now road legal thanks to an incorporated third brake light.
The front bumper, splitter, and hood have been redesigned, with the splitter retaining the 570S GT4's aero blades and cut-outs, while the carbon fiber hood has twin nostrils to aid downforce and clean up the airflow over the top of the car. Front dive planes contribute up to 66 pounds of downforce as part of the 143 pounds delivered by the full-frontal aero package.
Stopping power is provided by a lightweight braking system with carbon-ceramic discs (15.3-inch front and 14.9-inch rear) and forged aluminum brake calipers. As standard, the 620R rides on Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tires, but these can be swapped with optional, full-slick motorsport tires for track driving.
Specially developed for McLaren by Pirelli's Motorsport team, the slick tires are optimized to complement the motorsport brakes and race-derived suspension of the 620R. They unlock a contact patch eight percent larger than the road tire, increasing lateral G-forces and enabling quicker lap times. This is the first time that a road-legal car with 19-inch front wheels and 20-inch rear wheels has been engineered to be able to run on slick tires without the need for additional mechanical adjustment.
Being based on a GT4 race car, the interior has been stripped out and lacks luxuries such as a floor carpet and glovebox. Air-conditioning, IRIS Navigation, and an audio system are not included as standard but can be added at no extra cost. An upgraded Bowers & Wilkins upgraded audio system is available as an optional extra. The driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fiber racing seats with six-point racing harnesses, fitted as standard. A McLaren Track Telemetry system comes as standard and is displayed on a center-mounted seven-inch touchscreen.
Three colors are available inspired by the 570S: McLaren Orange (with white racing stripes), Silica White (orange stripes) and Onyx Black (orange stripes). Each can be optioned with race number decals and/or partner decals. Additional body colors are available from MSO.
The McLaren 620R will be limited to just 350 units. Production will begin in January, with each car starting at $328,951 including taxes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cryptocurrency Exchange - Here are tips to choose the best</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The exchange you must have decided to make use of will greatly determine whether your crypto investment will be profitable or not in the long run. There are lots of investors who have ignored this aspect of digital currency investment and eventually lost lots of money. In case you don't know, exchange is simply the gateway through which your cryptocurrencies will be traded. This is perhaps why you need to take out time and ensure the right one is chosen.  There are lots of exchanges to choose from which will even make your task of selecting one that can meet your needs more difficult. Here is the great part The good part about all of this is that you don't have to rack your brains on this subject matter again. This is because the major aim of this post is to list out some of those variables to consider while searching for a crypto exchange platform. Just ensure to follow these tips and your investments will be safe 100% of the time. Location is vital The first thing to consider about an exchanging platform is whether it is operating legally within your country. Countries vary when it comes to crypto regulations. Simply put, what may apply within a country may not apply in another one. Even in the United States, there are times states may vary when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations. Before deciding to sign up with any platform, ensure to always know whether its operations are in line with the legal stipulations of your location.  Reputation and authenticity There is one major problem about the cryptocurrency market at the moment which is the fact that barriers for getting into it are very few. This gives room for fraudulent dealers to get both potential and existing investors ripped off. Before deciding to register with any exchange, try to find out whether it has been registered as a company. It may shock you to know that most of these companies are only making false claims about their legal status. This is why you need to carry out every necessary investigation in order to safeguard your crypto investments. Also, you will have to be aware of bitcoin revolution scam speculations in the web and arrive at a clear view on your own. Check various social media platforms if you have to and find out whether others are using such exchange.  Consider security Crypto exchanges have been facing lots of security challenges over the years. While experts have predicted that this problem may not get better, there is still need for you to find out platforms which have improved security measures to ensure your investments are protected in the best way possible. A typical example of security challenges is the issue of $137million which was reportedly missing in QuadrigaCX after the demise of its founder. LiquidityThe higher the trade volumes; the higher the liquidity will be. It means your chosen exchange will be able to handle your orders much quicker. Avoid those exchanges that have very low trade volumes as this can affect your business more than imagined. Customer SupportThis entails trying to sign up with a platform where there is great support. It is only natural that you will experience one or two challenges along the line. Therefore, look out for a crypto exchange which will attend to your problems without any delay.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The first Nokia-branded smart TV launches tomorrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gadgets 360 reports that the Nokia television boasts a 55-inch 4K screen (16:9) with a 60Hz refresh rate and an Android-based operating system. Its sound quality could be the TV’s biggest draw as it features JBL audio tech and 24-watt speakers.
Other specs include support for Dolby Vision and HDR10, Bluetooth 5.0, three HDMI ports, and two USB ports. You also get 2.25GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage.
“Flipkart’s understanding of the needs and behaviors of Indian consumers, and the power of its reach, will help it make Nokia branded smart TVs accessible and affordable,” said Vipul Mehrotra, Flipkart’s VP of Nokia brand partnerships.
The TV will sell for 41,999 Rupees, which is about $590, through Flipkart beginning tomorrow (December 10). It comes with a bundled stand, wall mount, and Bluetooth remote that supports Google Assistant, all of which make it sound like pretty good value. Sadly, there’s no word on if the TV will launch internationally.
Flipkart added that more Nokia-branded TVs would arrive in the future.
This isn’t the first TV to come from Nokia. During its heyday in the 1990s, the company produced both monitors and televisions.
In its more familiar phone market, we recommended the Nokia 6.2 as one of the best budget phones in our Best of Smartphones feature.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An anonymous reader shares a report: Verizon, which bought Yahoo in 2017, has suspended email addresses of archivists who are trying to preserve 20 years of content that will be deleted permanently in a few weeks. As Verizon announced in October, the company intends to wipe all content from Yahoo Groups. As of December 14, all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed. The mass deletion includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, database, calendar, attachments, conversations, email updates, message digests, and message histories that was uploaded to Yahoo servers since pre-Google 1990s. Verizon planned to allow users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, but apparently it has a problem with the work of The Archive Team who wants to save content to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site. "Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," reported the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. "Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups -- which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nokia Does Smart TVs Now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While terms like '3310' and 'Snake' come to mind when Nokia is mentioned, that may be about to change.
The smart phone company is getting into the smart TV game. Well, it's letting its name be slapped on one at the very least.
Indian company Flipkart has secured a licensing deal with Nokia for its new 55-inch smart TV.
It will have a 4K UHD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of max brightness, Dolby vision and HDR10 support, two 24-watt JBL by Harman speakers, 16GB on-board storage, a quad-core processor, three HDMI ports, two USB-ports, Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity.
It will also run an Android 9 operating system with access to Google Play.
"The first-ever Nokia branded Smart TV with Sound by JBL is powered by 24 Watt built-in speakers, DTS TruSurround and Dolby Audio to enhance the overall audio experience at home," Flipkart said in a statement. "This feature addresses a major pain point among Indian consumers, many of whom except a better sound quality from their televisions today."
According to Gadgets 360, Flipkart has stated that its looking to sell more Nokia-branded TVs in the future, though there are no details as yet. We are also unsure if we will ever see them in Australia, though it seems unlikely.
The Nokia 55 Inch Ultra HD TV (4K) will launch in India on December 10 and will have an RRP of 41,999 Indian rupees, which is about $862.

    <h5 class="mb-1">More than half of NHS devices are still running Windows 7</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NHS TRUSTS are still running Microsoft's soon-to-be-defunct Windows 7 operating system on more than 20,000 devices.
That's according to cloud computing firm Citrix, which obtained the information through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. The request was sent to 98 NHS Trusts across the UK, of which 77 responded. 
As per the FoI, 52 per cent of the total 447,000+ devices being used in the NHS, including desktops, laptops, and tablets, are still running Windows 7, which reaches end-of-life status on 14 January 2020. 
That's despite the fact that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) last year announced a £150m plan to upgrade all NHS systems to Windows 10 by the time that Windows 7 reaches the digital graveyard. However, it's worth noting that the NHS is an E5 licence holder, which means it'll get an extra year of Windows 7 support for free. 
Back to the FoI, and 78 per cent of NHS organisations say they are currently working to migrate their systems to Windows 10 within the next six months, and a further six per cent of Trusts are considering migrating in the near future.
23 per cent of the trusts responding to the FoI request said 10 or more applications they use on their systems still need remediation to ensure ease of use and stability when moving to Windows 10.
Fewer than a quarter (23 per cent) said they had already deployed or were planning to deploy cloud or virtualisation technology to help migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The use of these technologies will help NHS Trusts in centralising the management of desktop environments, thereby leading to a more efficient and cost-effective migration.
"The NHS is unquestionably dedicated to delivering first-class patient services," said Matt Smith, Director, Public Sector, UK & Ireland, Citrix.
"Yet prolonged austerity is putting it under even more pressure to do more with less.
"Given the additional security considerations that come with outdated technology, migrating to Windows 10 within the 'next six months' could be too little, too late. Ensuring IT infrastructure is up-to-date and secure is necessary to both better support NHS staff in their day-to-day jobs and ensure first-class healthcare services in the UK."
While the use of Window 7 in such large numbers across the NHS worrying, it's made huge strides since July, when the Department of Health and Social Care revealed that over 1 million NHS computers were still using Windows 7. At the same time, it fessed that NHS Trusts are still using more than 2,000 PCs running Microsoft's long-defunct Windows XP OS. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's Mac Pro will be 'available to order' this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GOOD NEWS MONEYBAGS-MAC FANS, the cheese grater inspired Mac Pro is going to be available to order from Tuesday, according to an email that's been going out to interested parties.
If you're unaware of the Mac Pro's imminent arrival and haven't been saving up, you may want to move along now. As you can see in the tweet below, the email was extremely light on details, but we already know what the entry-level Mac Pro will set you back: $5,999, or around £4,557 if you're on this side of the Atlantic. 
Again, that's the entry-level Mac Pro, although the term is pretty relative given the basic model packs an eight-core Xeon processor, 32GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and a Radeon Pro 580X graphics card. Expect to easily clear five figures for the fully upgraded version with a 28-core processor and 1.5TB of RAM. 
Maybe ask Calvin Harris if his is any good before you put in that pre-order.
If you're sucking air through your teeth at this point, you may want to look away now, because while Apple also promised the Pro Display XDR will be available to order at the same time, it's even weaker value. The 32in display may pack a 6K resolution with 1,000,000:1 contrast, but it'll also sell for $4,999 (around £3,797) with an extra $1,000 if you want the fancy anti-glare nano-texture coating. 
The real cherry on the cake is the $999 Apple wants you to pay for a stand, though. We'll just rest it in the corner of the room, thanks. Yes, there used to be a chair there, but we sold it to pay for the Mac.
You never know - maybe Apple will feel generous with its dollar-to-pound conversions. Though if we were to give you odds on that, it'd be close to that contrast ratio we mentioned above. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy S11 specs, release date and price: In-the-wild images show chunky camera hump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WE'RE STILL MONTHS AWAY from the arrival of Galaxy S11, but it's already shaping up to be one of Samsung's most interesting flagships yet.
Speculation suggests the S11 lineup, comprising the Galaxy S11e, Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+, will up the ante in the screen department with larger SAMOLED 120Hz displays, and in the camera stakes with a mammoth 108MP main sensor. There's also talk that the handset true will boast souped-up internals, an all-new facial recognition system and baked-in 5G support. 
We've rounded up everything we know about Samsung's Galaxy S11 lineup below. 
Release date and priceAs per unsurprising rumours, the Galaxy S11 lineup will debut in "mid to late February", suggesting a pre-MWC launch is likely on the cards. 
There's no word on pricing yet, but if anything like last year's Galaxy S10, expect the so-called S11e, S11 and S10+ to fetch £699, £799 and £899, respectively. 
Latest news9/12/19: The Galaxy S11 has made its in-the-wild debut, courtesy of tipster Ice Universe who has shared the first images of the flagship in the flesh.
Though the images aren't the, er, clearest, they show the Galaxy S11's rear camera hump, which will allegedly add 1.1mm of thickness to the device - hardly surprising given rumours that it'll sport a 108MP primary camera and a periscope-style telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom.
6/12/19:  Samsung is planning a major overhaul of the Galaxy S11's camera in a bid to better compete with the iPhone, Bloombergreports. Adding weight to previous rumours, the report - citing the usual sources familiar with the matter - says the Galaxy S11 will sport the Samsung-made 108MP sensor that recently appeared on Xiaomi's CC9 Pro. This will reportedly be accompanied by three other lenses including ultrawide-angle and Time of Flight (Tof) sensors. 
Separately, SamMobile is reporting that the highest-end Galaxy S11+ could sport a mammoth 5,000mAh battery, a huge improvement over the 4,100mAh battery inside this year's 4,100mAh offering. 
5/12/19: There's yet more evidence that the Galaxy S11 will be capable of capturing 8K video, as SamMobile is reporting that its sources have "confirmed" the feature for Samsung's next flagship. This is hardly surprising, as Samsung's Exynos 990 processor supports 8K video capture at 30 frames-per-second, and it's likely Qualcomm's newly-announced Snapdragon 865 - which will power S11 handsets in the US - will also support the feature. 
2/12/19: Tipster Ice Universe has shared an image of an alleged Galaxy S11 screen protector, which hints that the handset will boast a tiny punch-hole cutout and barely-there bezels.
The image (above) shows that the front-facing camera will be placed at the top centre of the display, as seen on the Galaxy Note 10. It also confirms, if legit, that the Galaxy S11 will have little in the way of screen surroundings; there's virtually no bezel at the top and sides and a tiny chin underneath the display.
27/11/19: The Galaxy S11+ has shown up in official-looking renders, just days after it appeared on Geekbench. The image (above), courtesy of CashKaro and @OnLeaks, show that the S11+ will look similar to its smaller S11 and S11e siblings with a curved edge display, centrally-aligned punch-hole and a USB-C port at the bottom. 
 
Elsewhere, the report claims the Galaxy S11+ will sport a 6.9in Dynamic OLED screen with an under-display fingerprint sensor and will measure in at 8.8mm thick. 
25/11/19: The first benchmark results for the Galaxy S11 5G have appeared on Geekbench
The listing for the handset confirms that the flagship will pack Samsung's new octa-core Exynos 990 SoC running at 1.95GHz; US-bound variants of the device will likely pack Qualcomm's incoming Snapdragon 865 chipset. While that all sounds well and good, the benchmark scores - 447 in single-core and 2,326 in multi-core performance - are somewhat disappointing; the iPhone 11, for example, scored 1,333 and 3,251 on Geekbench, and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 10 scored 736 and 2,691. 
22/11/19: A filing at China's 3C certification agency, spied by DroidShout, has all but confirmed that there will be a 5G variant of the Galaxy S11. It's not all good news though, as the listing - which references the devices as the SM-G9860 - reveals that the 5G model will ship with 25W fast charging support. While that's an upgrade over the 15W charging offered with the Galaxy S10, it's lacking compared to the 45W charging offered by the Note 10+. 
21/11/19: Samsung has inadvertently revealed another key feature of the Galaxy S11, as in its newly-released One UI beta for the Galaxy Note 9, eagle-eyed users have spotted references to a 120Hz display.
As per Ice Universe (above), a new mode in Samsung's software will allow users to switch between a 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rate, while a third mode will allow for the screen to switch automatically between 60Hz and 120Hz.
 20/11/19: Samsung has pushed out a new version of its Camera app and inadvertently revealed some clues about the Galaxy S11.
As spied by XDA Developers, the latest version of the app has references to 8K video recording - a feature also supported by Samsung's Exynos 9980 SoC. The chipset, which is expected to power US variants of Samsung's next flagship, will feature 8K@30fps video decoding/encoding capabilities. 
If 8K support is included, the 12MP camera found on the Galaxy S10 ain't going to cut it. Handily, the updated Camera app also includes references to 108MP photos, adding yet more weight to the rumours that the handset will sport Samsung's yet-to-be-announced, second-generation 108MP camera sensor. 
Another bit of code inside the app makes reference to a 20:9 aspect ratio display, possible confirmation that the S11 will ditch the 19:9 screen found on Samsung's Galaxy S10 handsets. 
10/11/19: Evan Blass has spilled some details about the S11 lineup, claiming the flagship will launch in three different sizes.
In a tweet, Blass says that the Galaxy S11 will comprise 6.4in (S11e), 6.7in (S11) and 6.9in (S11+) variants; by comparison, the S10e, S10 and S10+ ship with 5.8in, 6.1in and 6.4in screens, respectively. 
However, in a follow-up message, Blass notes that the smaller model could sport a larger 6.4in display - as large as the screen on the S10 Plus - stating that he's received "conflicting information" about the entry-level model.
The two smaller models will be made available in both 4G and 5G variants, according to Blass, while the top-end Galaxy S11+ will launch with 5G-only. He also notes that all models will have curved-edge displays, marking the end of Samsung's S10e-style flat panels.
Blass claims the Galaxy S11 series will make its debut in "mid to late February", suggesting a pre-MWC launch is likely on the cards.
8/11/19: The Galaxy S11 will allegedly sport a "new" 108MP main camera sensor.
So says Twitter tipster Ice Universe (below), who claims the S11 won't use the 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that Samsung launched earlier this year, but will instead boast an upgraded second-gen sensor. 
It's unclear how the new sensor will improve on the three-month-old lens that's expected to debut on Xiaomi's CC9 Pro and Mi Note 10 smartphones, as though Ice Universe thinks there's a "high possibility" it'll debut on the Galaxy S11, he doesn't share any additional details. 
The first-gen sensor is the smartphone sensor to adopt a 1/1.33-inch size, which means it can absorb more light in low-lit settings than smaller sensors, while its pixel-merging Tetracell technology compresses four pixels into one to produce brighter 27MP images.
It also supports video recording without losses in field-of-view at resolutions up to 6K at 30-frames-per-second.
31/10/19: A new rumour claims Samsung is working on a new facial recognition system that likely will debut on the Galaxy S11 next year.
References to the as-yet-unannounced face recognition system have been spied in Samsung's One UI 2.0 beta by both TechTastic and XDA's Max Winebach (below), who spotted references to "FaceService" for the Picasso - the codename for the Galaxy S11.   
Though current flagship Samsung devices feature facial recognition, this leak suggests the company is working on a souped-up version based on 3D rather than 2D in order to make it more accurate and secure like the Face ID and Face Unlock tech found on the iPhone and Pixel 4, respectively.
Samsung, naturally, hasn't commented on the leak, but given the recent issues surrounding the fingerprint scanners on its Galaxy devices, a shift to face recognition would certainly make sense for the company.
30/10/10: We're likely still months away from the official unveiling of the Galaxy S11, but the first rumours are starting to crop up.
Following the leak that it'll likely launch on 18 February (below), we're now hearing that the Galaxy S11 will be powered by Qualcomm and Samsung's as-yet-unannounced Snapdragon 865 and Exynos 9830 processors, respectively. 
This somewhat unsurprising information - though some rumours had pointed to Samsung's new Exynos 980 SoC powering the Galaxy S11 lineup - was uncovered in a OneUI 2.0 beta by XDA's Max Weinbach. 
The Snapdragon 865, which will likely be unveiled in December at Qualcomm's annual Tech Summit, will reportedly be based on the 7nm EUV-based fabrication process and leaked benchmarks peg it as an octa-core SoC with a base frequency of 1.8GHz.
Samsung's Exynos 9830 is unlikely to make its debut until next year, but we already know a bit about the chip; rumours claim it'll rely on four Cortex A55 cores for low-performance and four Cortex A77 cores for high-performance.  
Weinbach also found references to three models of the Galaxy S11, at least one of which supports 5G. The One UI beta also includes references to LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.0 storage support.
7/10/19: We don't yet know much about the Samsung Galaxy S11, but we might already know when it will be launching.
A source speaking to SamMobile has claimed that the next-gen Galaxy flagship will make its debut on 18 February, just days before next year's Mobile World Congress kicks off. 
While such a date would make sense - the Galaxy S10 landed on 20 February, and the Galaxy S9 before it on 25 February - even SamMobile is sceptical; it notes that it's "not confident enough in the source of this information to put our weight behind the date provided", so we'd take this early rumour with a hefty pinch of salt.
Beyond this shady leak, there's not much information surrounding the Galaxy S11 yet. There's some chatter that the smartphone will feature the bonkers 108MP camera sensor that Samsung showed off earlier this year, and SamMobile notes that it'll likely ship with One UI 2.1 and up to 1TB of internal storage. 
There's also a "very good chance" the Galaxy S10 will somewhat inevitably follow in the footsteps of the Note 10 and ditch the line-up's long-standing headphone jack in favour of USB-C.
If we were to put our speculative hat on, we'd also assume the Galaxy S11 will pack Qualcomm's next-generation Snapdragon 865 SoC, 5G support, a punch-hole display with baked-in fingerprint scanner and triple rear-mounted camera setup. µ

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ford is recalling nearly 262,000 heavy-duty pickup trucks in the U.S. and Canada because the tailgates can open unexpectedly.
The recall covers F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks from the 2017 through 2019 model years. All the trucks have electric tailgate latch release switches in the tailgate handle.
Ford says water can get into the electrical wiring and cause a short circuit, activating the switches and releasing the latches.
The company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries.
Trucks with mechanical tailgate latches are not affected. Dealers will fix the tailgate frame wiring harnesses and install a new tailgate handle release switch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel Auto Call Screening, Memory Management Updates Coming With New 'Feature Drop'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Pixel 4 family is famous for its strong support from Google. Google tends to support the devices with three years of major Android OS, along with feature/security updates, which is much better than we typically expect from other Android OEMs. Google is now introducing a new category of updates for its Pixel devices, and it is calling it a "feature drop".
Google says that feature drops bring bigger and more impactful updates than the typical security updates and bug fixes, and will come "on a regular basis." The first feature drop is coming later this month and includes a handful of new features for Pixel users.
One of the most prominent additions is the ability for the Google Assistant to automatically screen calls. The feature should help to make your life a bit more manageable as it will not only detect robocalls, but it will also screen unknown callers before your phone even rings. If the Google Assistant determines that the call is actually important, Google says that "your phone rings a few moments later with helpful context" about the caller.
Other new features that will be arriving this month include the ability to apply portrait "blur" to an image post-capture, and auto-framing for Duo video calls. The latter update will automatically keep your face centered thanks to the use of the Pixel 4's wide-angle selfie camera. Portrait-style effects can be applied for Duo calls to blur out your background (especially helpful if your room or office is a disaster) and is applicable to the Pixel 2, Pixel 3 and Pixel 4.
Rounding out the bevy of new functionality are improvements to memory management, which will be especially welcome to Pixel 3 and Pixel 2 owners. According to Google, "Your phone proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more."
Google says that the first feature drop is already in the process of being pushed out to Pixel owners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Could This Be The OnePlus 8 Lite Phone On Deck For A 2020 Launch?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There might not be all that many surprises from OnePlus in 2020, at least in regards to its OnePlus 8 series of smartphones. We have already seen leaked renders of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro over the past few months. Now we can add a OnePlus 8 Lite model to the mix, with a fresh set of renders showing off the device.In case you missed any of the past leaks, the OnePlus 8 will supposedly launch with a curved-edge display sporting a punch-hole design, and three cameras on the rear on the device. The OnePlus 8 Pro, meanwhile, sports a similar design with the same curved-edge display and punch-hole design for the front camera, but with a quad-camera arrangement on the back.Both of those are going to be high-end handsets that occupy the flagship space. The OnePlus 8 Lite, however, is poised to be a mid-range phone with a design that is more in line with Samsung's Galaxy S11, Note 10 Lite, and Galaxy A91.
As has been a recurring collaboration, notorious leaker @OnLeaks joined forces with 91mobiles to post a handful of renders showcasing the OnePlus 8 Lite. Unlike the other two phones in the OnePlus 8 series, the OnePlus 8 Lite touts a flat-display design, which is estimated to be between 6.4 and 6.5 inches. It also sports a punch-hole cutout for the front camera, positioned in the center at the top of the handset.We can also make out some other details, such as a Type-C port on the bottom and an alert slider on the side. Missing, however, is a 3.5mm headphone jack.On the back, there is a curved glass panel with a reflective finish. We also see a rectangular housing of the rear cameras—there appear to be two camera lenses, along with an LED flash and some other sensors (possibly a Time of Flight sensor being among them).OnLeaks says the phone measures around 159.2 x 74 8.6mm. Beyond that, there are no other concrete details, such as which processor will be inside, what the specs of the cameras are, and whether or not it will feature a 90Hz refresh rate display like the other two OnePlus 8 models.Images Source: 91mobiles (via OnLeaks)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thing on your phone you only ever open by accident may soon become a thing you occasionally open on purpose, should you be the owner or potential owner of an electric car. This is thanks to EV charge point specialist Zap-Map adding access to most of its database of chargers via the "OK Google" voice search, making it straightforward to find a charge location without getting done or publically shamed for looking at your phone while driving.
Zap-Map says Android-powered smartphone users are able to use hands-free voice commands to order their telephone to find the nearest EV charge point; and results may then be filtered by charge speed, location, station operator or driving distance, with your virtual assistant also filled in on if the charger is working or out of order for some reason, and suggesting on-route locations if you're already on a satnav mission.
Zap-Map's Ben Lane said: "We are providing a quick and simple way for EV drivers to find out information on charge points at home, on the move and, for the first time ever, hands-free when they most need it -- while driving." [Zap-Map]

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netflix Has Scrapped Its Free 30-Day Trials Because You're a Cheap Arsehole</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix is either making another seemingly anti-consumer move, or there's enough people playing silly buggers to warrant the decision.
The streaming service offers a free 30-day trial to give you a little taste of the goods and - hopefully - get you hooked into dropping that sweet subscription fee every month. But it seems those golden days are over, as the option appears to have disappeared from the website.
Trusted Reviews reports that the free trial is no longer available in the UK, and the only comment Netflix has made so far has been to MoneySavingExpert, saying that existing customers who have already started the trial won't be affected, but no one else is getting in.
The Netflix spokesperson also said that the platform was "looking at different marketing promotions in the UK to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience," but didn't elaborate on what that entails.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has previously demonstrated a fairly laid back approach to people finding ways to avoid paying the sub fees but getting the content anyway - like password sharing, saying it's "something you have to learn to live with."
He apparently did a 180 with the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) - of which Netflix is a member - announcing that it would be working to tackle unauthorised access to content citing “improper password sharing” as an example.
Maybe people were going a bit nuts with free trials on a plethora of email accounts to the point that it's become an issue. Or perhaps the streaming wars means finding more ways to wring cash out of everyone. We've contacted Netflix for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crypto Is Money: Dai Stablecoin Support Arrives on Coinbase Debit Card</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TwitterFacebookWhatsAppGoogle+BufferLinkedIn
If you can spend cryptocurrency in mainstream society, then crypto is money — at least so says the tech’s biggest proponents.
Following that line of thought, the Dai — the Ethereum community’s darling stablecoin — definitely just took another decisive step toward “currency” status, insofar as U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase revealed on December 6th it had added Dai support to its “Coinbase Card” debit card offering.
Accordingly Dai joins the card, which was launched back in the spring and is currently only available in the United Kingdom and the European Union, as its 10th addition, with the assets it already supports including (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP, Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), 0x (ZRX), and Stellar lumens (XLM).
As such, Coinbase’s European users can now spend their Dai holdings for everyday purchases, which for many Dai proponents is the point of using the stablecoin in the first place — to spend your stable Dai while holding your volatile ETH, as it were, since each Dai is worth approximately $1 USD. On the flip side, ether — which is more akin to a commodity — has considerably more investment upside and considerably more risk.
The development is another step toward mainstream adoption for the stablecoin, whose builders undertook a rebranding last month in order to make the “dollar coin’s” aesthetics more in line with other major world currencies.
Wyre, known by some as the “Stripe” of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, explained more this week on their platform’s coming “meta transactions” capability, which the company said will arrive in 2020 and will allow users to interact wither Ethereum decentralized finance applications directly from their debit cards.
Specifically, Wyre said meta transactions would “effectively turn … Apple Pay or Google Pay wallets into secure Ethereum wallets to fund [DeFi] transactions.”
That’s a big deal, because one pain point for new users to cryptocurrency has been the knowledge gap, e.g. not knowing where to begin. With fiat DeFi on-ramps, Wyre will make Ethereum’s dApps more readily accessible to everyday users, which should drive adoption in turn.
Last month, the Maker community — stewards of the Dai stablecoin — undertook their biggest evolutionary action to date in voting, and thereafter activating, Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD).
Prior to MCD, Maker dApp users could only draw out automated Dai loans using ether as collateral. In the wake of MCD, more cryptocurrencies beyond ETH can now be used as collateral for Maker loans. The first additional crypto to be voted in by MKR token holders was Basic Attention Token.
With that said, MCD is set to supersede the previously reigning “Single-Collateral Dai,” which is now known as Sai. Assuming liquidity is available, Sai holders can migrate their tokens to Dai at any time using a special migration smart contract deployed by Maker’s builders.
At press time, there 45.5 million Dai and 58.5 million Sai in circulation, meaning the new MCD version of the stablecoin has come close to “flippening” its predecessor in number.
Maybe, maybe not. But it’s clear the decentralized stablecoin has structural and timing advantages over America’s actual dollar minters at the U.S. Treasury.
Why? Firstly, because the Dai is already here and useful for people around the world while top U.S. officials have no plans for releasing a digital dollar any time soon. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin just told American legislators that the government isn’t putting USD on the blockchain for the foreseeable future.
Secondly, the Dai is permissionless to a degree that the U.S. government likely doesn’t agree with. Yet it is growing increasingly popular for that very reason.

MIDI CC envelopes can now send curved messages to your hardware or software devices, meaning you get smooth, continuous parameter changes instead of discrete events. A new time-stretching algorithm, a graphic patchbay for advanced routing, embedded plug-in displays and improved performance in large projects are among the other improvements. Find out more details on the Reaper website. Reaper 6 is only $60, which is considerably cheaper than more popular DAWs. The cost includes free updates until version 7.99.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTube unveils top Indian ads watched in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
Google India recently announced its annual YouTube advertisement leaderboard for India, which highlighted the ads that have received the maximum views and shares from audiences across the country.
While Kia Motor's ad for its Seltos triggering design creativity bagged some 232 million views, Samsung India's campaign for its Good Vibes struck a chord with netizens garnering over 205 million views.
Chinese handset maker Oppo's ad spot for its F11 pro model bagged over 96 million views, while a television commercial by Xiaomi India about Mi TV brand registered over 133 million views.
Given the huge number of electronic and mobile brands that have made it to the top rank, BusinessLine reached out to Satya Raghavan, Director - YouTube Partnerships, India, to know what the trend revealed about consumption patterns across the country.
"YouTube’s year-end ads leaderboard is a reflection and true representation of the year’s biggest campaigns," said Raghavan. “With the growing reach and highly engaged audience, YouTube today is a preferred launch platform for brands. This is reflected in the leaderboard with Kia motors and many of the new mobile phone brands,” he said.
Noting that while advertisers have always preferred YouTube for long form ads, Raghavan said brands are also tapping into YouTube Blast that offers "unparalleled reach with relevant audience in minimum time and eventually provides higher impact."
As for helping brands reach out to consumers in today's cluttered marketplace, Raghavan clarified, “Viewers don’t come to YouTube for distraction, they come to engage. According to an independent study commissioned by Ipsos, 85 per cent of our subscribers watch new videos from their favourite creators within two days. And, that engagement also applies to ads. More than 95 per cent of YouTube ads are viewable, the highest rate in the industry," he added.
Samsung India created a campaign for its Good Vibes app which helps deaf and blind people communicate with others. Made by advertising agency Cheil, the campaign tells the story of a young deaf and blind girl who uses the Good Vibes app to reach out to her family. The ad bagged the second spot on the leaderboard.
Another television commercial by Xiaomi India highlighted smart features of its Mi TV brand, specifically the voice command capability powered by Google Assistant. The brand leveraged the on screen chemistry of actors Sumeet Raghavan and Rupali Ganguly, aka comedy show series Sarabhai versus Sarabhai fame. This ad bagged the fourth spot on the leaderboard.
Chinese handset maker Oppo's ad spot for its F11 pro model was about key features and sleek design and bagged the fifth highest viewership.
At the seventh spot on the leaderboard is Aditya Birla Group's 'Big in your life' campaign which showcases the company’s journey of a brand that reached out to and empowers people at every stage in their life.
Given the massive depth and diversity of content on the platform, brands have leveraged YouTube to tell some of the year’s most compelling brand stories, the best of which form the YouTube ads leaderboard for 2019.
The list represents the top 10 ads on YouTube in India that resonated most with audiences and celebrates the brands that performed best through a combination of popularity and promotion.
Over the years, video have gone mainstream with YouTube-- now reaching 265 million monthly active users as per ComScore 2019 (April), making it a go-to destination for brands. They have innovatively capitalised on YouTube’s popularity by creating engaging ads, says the official.
Over the last two years, the company has launched several ad products – Bumpers, Director Mix, TrueView, Video Ads Sequencing and YouTube Blast, being the newest tool. "These products are designed to ensure that YouTube is the perfect platform for both brand and performance advertisers," said Raghavan.
Citing an example, he added, with formats such as TrueView for Action, advertisers can create ads with interactive functionality. "This has been a huge success for performance advertisers looking to optimise video for a specific user action, like signing up for a service or buying a product," he added.
Speaking about leads and referrals, Raghavan added though YouTube is driving brand awareness and consideration, with TrueView for Action the firm can now offer a full funnel solution to drive results both online and offline.
"You can use video ads to drive any action on your website that’s important to your business, for example, leads or referrals. While driving online action is important, offline action is also crucial for driving business results and marketers across the board are tapping into this to drive business results," said Raghavan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taotronics SoundSurge 46 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones review – Best bang-for-your buck Noise Cancelling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Noise-cancelling is the current trend in headsets, and it’s one that makes sense in an increasingly, busy cacophonous world. The current kings on that arena are still Sony and Bose, who make the very best sets available. They’re still far too expensive for most, but ubiquity has led to competition – not just with features and function, but also affordability.
Noise cancelling headsets now run the gamut from thousands of Rands, to less than a thousand, each offering varying features for their price. One of the best sets to find a good balance between price and performance that I’ve used is the Taotronics TT-BH22. Though it has a few design issues, it offered a warm and rich sound, with feedback noise cancelling that surpassed more expensive sets. The follow-up set, the Taotronics Soundsurge 46 not only has a better name but also switches to a better form of noise cancelling. Instead of the cheaper to implement single-microphone, there’s now also a second, external microphone to help filter out extraneous noise.
Funnily, it’s not as immediately impressive as the noise cancelling on the TT-BH22, but that’s because that set did a better job of passive noise isolation. It is, however, far better at reducing the constant hums of traffic, fans, air condition and the other churning, droning cacophony of everyday life. I found the set to be especially good at removing the sometimes-overwhelming din of being at gym. I’ve used it on a long-haul flight, and it worked better than I expected for the purpose, removing the terribly pervasive roar of plane engines. As with most noise-cancelling though, it’s not especially good at removing sharp sounds like clattering mechanical keyboards, barking dogs or the sound of Darryn screaming from the basement he’s currently locked in.
Its noise-cancelling however, isn’t its best feature. That honour goes to its wonderful fast-charging capabilities. Though the set, like its forebear, is still fitted with the soon-to-be-outdated micro USB port, it allows for fast-charging, letting you get a few hours of listening off a 5-minute charge. That’s a godsend if you’ve somehow forgotten to charge the thing and need to dash out, but also a necessity given that the Soundsurge 46 carries through one of the biggest design faults of the previous set. There’s a dedicated toggle switch for noise cancelling, which means that it’s far too easy to forget to switch it off, leaving the batteries draining while they’re cancelling sound for an audience of zero. It’s not a problem that’s unique to TaoTronics, but it would be nicer to have a software-controlled noise-cancelling function that switched itself off when the headset itself switches off. The noise-cancelling drains the battery fairly quickly, reducing the manufacturer’s promised 30 hours of battery life considerably. I generally got around 20 hours off a single charge, using the set wirelessly with noise cancelling on.
While the Soundsurge 46, with its deep 40mm drivers has a better overall sound than the TT-BH22, I prefer the latter’s tuning, though the bass here is less likely to fatigue. Most modern, expensive headsets favour a neutral, flat sound that highlights authenticity in sound reproduction, The Soundsurge 46 is tuned like many consumer headsets from years ago – with a larger focus on thumping, punchy bass. That’s not to say that they’re tuned poorly or sound bad by any means; I think the best descriptor for their signature is “fun.” Music has a good, deep thud, and – when combined with the noise cancelling – is a delightful aural cocoon. The bass may be at the forefront, but it’s by no means overpowering. Listening to bass-heavy music like Portishead’s 1994 masterpiece Dummy, right through to Fleetwood Mac’s seminal “Rumours” (the beginning thumps of “Second Hand News” come through beautifully), and more modern fare like Post Malone’s Sunflower and Tool’s Fear Inoculum, it all came through warmly. There is perhaps a bit of dynamism that’s lost in the highs and mids, but it’s never muddy.
Unfortunately, despite some reports to the contrary, the set only supports Bluetooth 4.2, and worse still is that it uses the SBC codec instead of more modern, less compressed ones like aptX and LDAC. Thankfully, unlike the TT-BH22, it still sounds good used wirelessly and without ANC. The call microphone uses Qualcomm’s cVc noise cancelling, but like many products in this category, voice calls can sound hollow as a result.
Aesthetics are subjective, but I like the design of the Soundsurge 46. Unlike the TT-BH22’s that blatantly copy the Bose Quiet Comfort II, these have an understated, almost industrial design. A little generic? Sure, but sleek. Unlike that set, it doesn’t fold up for travel, but is portable enough thanks to cups that swivel 180 on their hinges. They also swivel back and forth on those hinges, ensuring a comfortable fit. The headband is pliable enough that it’s not brittle but remains sturdy. The cups and the underside of the headband are decked with soft foam and protein leather, making for a comfortable fit. The included accessories are generous. Not only do you get the usual charging cable, but also a 3.5mm cable, an aeroplane adapter, and a handy, durable carry-case.
On the right cup, you’ve got a 3.5mm jack and the physical button to enable noise cancelling, along with three buttons that all serve double (and in some cases triple) duty. The power button is used not just to switch the set on and off, but also to enable pairing, while the volume buttons can also be used to skip through tracks and answer calls.
They’re available from Takealot for R1899.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Mercedes-Benz GLA Prototype Strips 2 Days Before Official Reveal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A little over six years have passed since the original Mercedes-Benz GLA (X156) was unveiled as the smallest crossover in the Mercedes-Benz lineup and its replacement's reveal is just around the corner.
Unless it gets leaked, we will get to see the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLA without any camouflage in less than 48 hours, as the crossover is set for a December 11 online reveal, and Mercedes-Benz has already teased the model on more than one occasion.
Caught by our collaborating spy photographers being tested around the streets of Stuttgart alongside a pre-facelift Mercedes-Benz GLC, the new GLA seems quite a bit bigger than its predecessor.
Slightly longer and taller, the car also seems to have much higher ground clearance, almost identical to the more SUV-like GLC that's following close behind. Mercedes-Benz might have responded to the first-generation GLA's criticism, with many people seeing it more like a raised hatchback than the crossover it so desperately tried to be.
The current generation had a so-called “off-road package” as an option on some markets, which raised the ground clearance a further 2 cm (0.8 inches) alongside other “rugged” modifications. That said, the car in the spy photo gallery looks like it's ready for some off-roading at the mall parking lot with those 21-inch wheels and minuscule tire walls.
Based on the same MFA2 (Modular Front-wheel-drive Architecture 2) platform as the latest A-Class, B-Class, CLA and the first generation of the GLB 7-seat crossover, the all-new GLA will feature similar interior design and an identical engine lineup.
This translates into an assortment of 1.3-liter and 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engines and 1.5 and 2.0-liter diesels, paired with either front-wheel-drive for the less powerful versions and AWD for the others. A plug-in hybrid version and two Mercedes-AMG versions will become available later on in the product-cycle.
You will get the choice of rowing your own with a six-speed manual transmission but two dual-clutch transmissions will also be available - a 7-speed and an 8-speed one for the more powerful engine versions. 🏁

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Is USB4 And Do You Need It?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">USB is still one of the most important pieces of technology in the 21st century. They charge your devices, they carry around your folders filled with files you hardly use or look at, and they help to transfer things between devices. But a new USB type is on its way and its going to change everything up. Here's what the USB4 is all about.
The USB4, first announced in March 2019, is marked down as the next generation of USB. Until now, USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and the current model, 3.2, have all been released with features expanding and improving upon the previous generation. This has meant faster upload and download transferring speeds, increased capacities and the ability to transfer files simultaneously. The USB4, however, will turn the humble USB into even more of a powerhouse.
In September 2019, the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) announced USB4's specifications giving us a better idea of what to expect. They would now be able to:
Firstly, speed. The USB4 will come with two speed lanes ⁠— 40Gps and 20Gps. That's already huge upgrade on the USB 3.2, which maxes out at 2.5Gps. That's a momentous amount of data flowing through your trust USB steed within a matter of seconds. Most importantly, it's far faster than internet speeds so while the cloud has been able to make possible the transfer of large files remotely, the USB4 will be incredibly useful when physical delivery of large files will suffice.
Aside from impressive transfer speeds, the USB4 will also be backwards compatible through the use of adapters. While it's compatible with USB 2.0 and higher (if you still use USB 1.0, it's time to upgrade), you probably won't get those mega speeds if you're using legacy cables and ports. Still, it's good to know our older tech won't become completely antiquated once USB4 rolls in. As the USB4 is based on Intel's Thunderbolt 3 specifications, it'll also support most Thunderbolt 3 cables. It's important to understand that Thunderbolt 3 compatibility isn't mandatory on all USB4s once production begins so it's always best to triple check in case your shiny new USB4 compatible laptop or tablet comes without it.
USB4 also promises to be a literal powerhouse. It'll come fitted with USB Power Delivery (USB PD) technology so you can charge your phones and devices through it with up to 100 watts of power. Given so many of us need to power up devices on the go with our laptops or through powerpoints, this will be a welcome improvement.
While it was first expected to be released in late 2019, that prediction is extremely unlikely at this stage. The specification announcement back in September provided no real clues but it's expected the USB4 will start rolling out from mid-2020 after the USB-IF's Compliance Workshop in February 2020.
I mean, laptops are already being fitted with USB4 ports so it can't reasonably be more than a year away. Surely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Break Out Of Apple's Walled Garden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has always been good at keeping people within its own little bubble. The company has strived for an insular ecosystem which can certainly make it tricky for those on the inside looking to break out. But it's by no means impossible.
If you're ready to venture out of the Apple bubble into the wider world of tech, here's how you can do it.
While hardware was once a major reason for jumping over to another brand, the points of difference between physical smartphones these days are pretty minimal. In other words, you're probably reading this because you're tired of iOS, have concerns over Apple's use of data, or simply want the freedom that comes with an Android, Windows, or Linux operating system, rather than switching it up for different hardware.
That being said, there are plenty of non-iOS alternatives to the apps and services available to Apple users, and making the switch over to most of them is fairly straight-forward.
One of the biggest services you'll probably want to cut ties with is iCloud, but luckily, Google Drive is waiting for you with open arms. In fact, it'll even help you transfer a bunch of your data from your iPhone to your new device. Download the app onto your iPhone and sync your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars, then follow these instructions for getting that data onto a new Android phone.
For iMessage, there are a ton of great universal alternatives that you're probably already using, so there shouldn't be any issues for you there. Facebook Messenger is a good start and can even be used as a standalone app, so you can still avoid Facebook proper if that's something you're keen on. If data privacy is important to you, apps like Signal or Wickr will ensure your messages are encrypted. WhatsApp is also another good alternative to iMessage.
When it comes to transferring data from a Mac computer to a PC, things are a little easier – a standard portable hard drive should do the trick. It's worth noting, however, that Apple-specific apps and the files that rely on them won't be able to be used, but chances are there's a good alternative in place.
Some software and services don't even need to be replaced completely, like Apple Music for example, which will work perfectly fine on Windows or Android, but if you plan on ditching Apple completely, Spotify is just as good, if not better for music streaming.
If you like using GarageBand for making or recording music, there are heaps of excellent PC equivalents, whether it's premium software packages like Cubase or Ableton, or free alternatives like Reaper. Movie Maker 10 is a good free replacement for Apple's iMovie if that's something you used for home movies.
In terms of password management, you can easily swap out the iCloud Keychain for a third-party app like 1Password or LastPass. For everything else, a quick Google search should put you on the right path for a suitable Windows/Android replacement.
Of course, you can't ditch the Apple ecosystem while you're running Apple hardware, so think about what operating system you'd like to go with and look into some hardware options. The most common alternative is Android for smartphones and Windows for laptops/desktop PCs, so that's generally a pretty good place to start.
Smartphones have a ton of options, with the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel ranges coming in as the top iPhone contenders. Samsung's phones provide good all-rounder alternatives, while the Pixel is a good bet if you wanna lean into Google's ecosystem a little harder. Outside of those, there are a bunch of other options, such as Huawei, Oppo, and Nokia smartphones.
While Apple was once on top with regards to laptop design, most brands now offer a sleek, slim model with just as much power and portability. Some will even offer far more than just a standard computer. For example, 2-in-1s such as the HP Spectre x360 (pictured above) fold all the way around to become a tablet with touchscreen functionality.
The good thing about making this transition is that you don't have to buy everything in one hit. In fact, there's nothing stopping you from running an iPhone and a Windows PC simultaneously because fortunately, Apple plays nice with a lot of its essential software.
Even if you do have to connect an iPhone to a PC – which is pretty rare these days given the variety of wireless setup options available – you can still easily install and run iTunes on Windows.
In other words, don't feel like you need to run out and buy a whole new suite of personal tech just to rip yourself out of Apple's ecosystem. Go with one device at a time, get a feel for it, and then size-up something else. This approach will also save you from outlaying a large sum of money in one hit, which means you can spend a little more on each item as you go to ensure you're getting quality devices.
Either way, it pays to do your research before jumping into something headfirst.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AWS Wavelength: The Cloud Comes to Your 5G Network</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What is AWS Wavelength? Among a flurry of product announcements at AWS Re:Invent, one drew arguably the most buzz from attendees on the conference floor: AWS Wavelength. Born of four initial partnerships with telecommunications businesses Verizon, Vodafone, South Korea’s SK Telecom, and Japan’s KDDI, the new service — primed for release in 2020 — aims to bring AWS’s compute and storage services “to the edge of 5G networks”. But what does that really mean?
Computer Business Review took a closer look.
There is no magic here — to an end-user the cloud is after all simply services running on third-party infrastructure — and reading between the lines, AWS Wavelength looks set to involve embedding Amazon’s servers at the telco “edge”, from base stations to telco data centres: anywhere it makes sense to put hardware to cut latency.
Emerging interactive applications like game streaming, virtual reality, and real-time rendering among others require lower latency than “classical” cloud services can manage, AWS noted, and even with 5G, if application traffic has to make too many hops before it hits an AWS data centre, latency suffers as a result.
“Today, application traffic has to travel from a device to a cell tower to metro aggregation sites to regional aggregation sites and to the Internet before it can access resources running in AWS. These network hops can result in latencies of more than 100 milliseconds. This prevents developers from realizing the full potential of 5G to address low-latency use-cases”, AWS explained in its release notes.
By teaming up with telcos to embed AWS hardware in their infrastructure, users will get access to AWS services (initially just Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and Amazon EKS, with more to follow) as close as possible to the point of use.
AWS’s Chris Barclay (principle product manager, tech, EC2) explained to Computer Business Review: “An extension of the AWS cloud within the telco environment, AWS Wavelength uses AWS Outposts as a building block to place AWS capacity into these telco facilities and provide AWS services.
“What’s unique about AWS Wavelength is the ability to create an EC2 instance directly within a telco provider’s network. This would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for customers. Imagine having to contact different telcos, and asking for access to capacity in each of their 5G locations.
“And, even if they could get that capacity, it would be nearly impossible to have a common way to manage across all those providers. Wavelength eliminates all this complexity and lets customers use the same familiar AWS APIs, tools, and functionality they use today, to deliver-low latency applications at the edge of 5G networks around the world…
“[by embedding] AWS compute and storage services within the network operators’ datacenters at the edge of the 5G network, application traffic only needs to travel from the device to a cell tower to a Wavelength Zone running in a metro aggregation site. By creating a subnet in one or more Wavelength Zones, such as Verizon Chicago, and launching resources like EC2 instances in that subnet, we give customers the same development experience that they’re used to.
He added: “AWS is responsible for the service. AWS Wavelength Zones are managed by the same control plane as AWS Availability Zones.”
Customers will use the same AWS APIs that they’re used to, and won’t need to know anything about the telco provider’s infrastructure or APIs.
Pressed on whether there are ways AWS is looking to tie Wavelength more broadly into telco efforts to switch to more cloud-native network functions, Barclay said the service is “an extension of the region for running applications in multi-tenant mode, and does not directly tie into cloud-native functions.”
He added: “However, the underlying technology in AWS Wavelength, which is the ability to run AWS virtual infrastructure in telco sites at the edge of 5G networks, can be used for running cloud-native telco workloads. We are actively evaluating and validating various telco network workloads on our edge infrastructure.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Assistant now lets you create lists, search for podcasts and share photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google on Friday added a range of new features to Google Assistant in an effort to simplify voice-enabled productivity.
“Starting to roll out today, you can use your Assistant to create and manage your notes and lists in Google Keep, Any.do, AnyList, or Bring! across Assistant-enabled phones and smart speakers,” the company said on its news blog.
Users can now enable support for third party list apps via the Assistant, where they can say things like “Hey Google, create a holiday gift list”. Additionally, users can use the Assistant to search for and listen to podcasts too.
“When you ask the Assistant for podcasts about a certain topic — ‘Hey Google, find a podcast about holiday cooking’ — it’ll suggest relevant episodes for you,” Google explained.
Meanwhile, users can also ask the Assistant to search for photos and share them directly by saying “Hey Google, look up photos from this weekend”.
According to Google, the new features are available on all Assistant-enabled phones.
In November, the company also released a news-reading Assistant feature in the United States.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antec has just released the new P120 Crystal PC case. It aims to be a competitive mid-tower for just 99 EUR (MSRP inc VAT). It’s ticking all the right boxes for a PC gaming build too. It features two sides of tempered glass, plentiful radiator and fan mounting space, and room for a massive GPU.
What I really love is that it features a vertical GPU mount with support for a triple-slot card. That means that even the most beastly GPUs on the market today can be mounted on their side.
Users can install VGA cards with a length of up to 450 mm and CPUs with a maximum height of 185 mm as well as PSUs with a maximum length of 294 mm.
The new P120 Crystal measures 475 x 232 x 480 mm. Build from 0.8 mm and 1 mm steel and finished with tempered glass front and side panels. It’s a great looking case, and as well made as rival offerings.
The mid-tower model features large interior space for E-ATX, ATX, micro-ATX and ITX motherboards. The isolated power supply chamber and drive cages are positioned on top of the chassis. The sleek tower offers space for two 2.5” or 3.5″ HDDs and two 2.5″ SDDs and seven horizontal and three vertical expansion slots. To keep its cool, the P120 offers space for three 120 mm or two 140mm case fans at the bottom, one 120 or 140 mm fan in the rear as well as up to three 120 mm or two 140mm case fans on the side of the chassis.
The Antec P120 Crystal is available now from Amazon in the UK and many other PC retailers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vodacom, SAPS power crime prevention via app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vodacom’s partnership with the South African Police Service (SAPS) to launch the MySAPS mobile app is part of the company’s transition to being a purpose-driven organisation.
This is according to Rudi Matjokana, managing executive for public enterprise at Vodacom Business, saying in addition to supporting national crime prevention efforts, the company seeks to ensure digital inclusion for all.
After a soft launch in August this year, Vodacom and SAPS unveiled the MySAPS app in October, with the aim to bring police services to the palm of the citizens’ hands.
The free app, developed and enabled by Vodacom, is available for devices running Android and iOS operating systems. For those that have feature phones, it can be accessed via USSD.
Matjokana told ITWeb Vodacom wants to enable and empower private and public organisations as well as help digitise government services to serve a broader society.
“Our purpose-driven mission is to connect people and things to the Internet. We also want to ensure inclusion for all and improve people’s lives.”
MySAPS app enables citizens to search for the nearest police station, submit a tip off, call the crime stop number, visit the SAPS Web site, as well as send messages, according to Matjokana,
He says the app is “for everyone’s safety”.“This is how we are changing criminal reporting. A person can report criminal acts as and when they see them and the police will act on it. You can report anonymously and the police will still act on whatever you say you need them to do.”
While he didn’t provide specifics in terms of how many times the app has been downloaded, Matjokana noted the reception has been quite good. “It’s just that we don’t have enough man power to be going around helping more people download the app.
“Every citizen should join us on this journey; we should not leave anybody behind. We should make sure that everybody can have access to these services [and] the Internet.”

By heading to the HUAWEI Online Official Store, you'll be able to redeem your RM200 voucher and use it on 12 December 2019. Yas, discounts are the best. :)
That's right, we Malaysians were the first in the world to get a glimpse of the HUAWEI Nova 5T ahead of it's global launch. Positioned as a lifestyle smartphone, the HUAWEI Nova 5T is for those who value top-notch performance, insane camera features, and aesthetically-pleasing design.
Coming with five different cameras - four on the rear and one on the front, the HUAWEI Nova 5T aims to capture that picture-perfect moment every single time. The rear Quad-AI camera setup consists of a 48MP main camera, a 16MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth-sensing camera. The depth-sensing lens helps with that buttery-smooth bokeh for portrait modes, which is always a plus!The 32MP front selfie camera is actually hidden under the 6.26-inch 'All-View Display'. This provides a flawless, unobtrusive content viewing experience, without any unnecessary distractions. 
Another neat feature of the Quad-AI camera setup is the ability to shoot stunning lowlight photography via the AIS Super Night Mode, which drastically reduces noise while still retaining as much light as possible. This is an especially useful feature for those who love the contrast of brightly-lit subjects in darker settings.Say goodbye to grainy night-time shots! ﻿
At the heart of the Nova 5T is the world's first 7nm mobile AI chipset, which lets you enjoy a super fluid, super smooth user experience, without any nasty lag. The dual-NPU setup enables the Nova 5T to take on even the most demanding tasks, like hardcore gaming and even a long day of multi-tasking! The power of the Kirin 980 chipset is also complemented by 8GB RAM and 128GB ROM, featuring ultra-fast storage (UFS) technology.Optimum performance at an efficient level of power consumption. What more could you ask for? :D
It's tiring when you have to wait for your phone to charge up before you can finally use it for your daily content viewing pleasure. The HUAWEI Nova 5T gets rid of that burden by packing a fairly decent 3,750 mAh battery, coupled with 22.5W SuperCharge technology. Just how fast is this charging technology exactly?It's pretty zippy. It takes just 30 minutes to get from a dead battery to 50%. That means you get to spend less time waiting for your phone to charge, and more time actually using it to its full potential!
The HUAWEI Nova 5T comes in three different colours - Black, Blue Crush, and Midsummer Purple. The exclusive Midsummer Purple variant also gets a special Nova monogram on the back, just to add to the stylish look of the device. The 6.26-inch 'All-View Display' provides a 91.7% screen-to-body ration, which means you'll really be able to see ALL of your content in such a pleasing screen size. The front-facing camera itself is placed on the top-left corner of the screen, hidden from direct line of sight. That means you're able to focus on your content, and just your content alone!The phone also uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, making it super ergonomic for daily use, since our natural grip usually rests our thumb (for right handers) and index finger (for lefties) where the sensor is positioned. No fumbling about here. :)
You can get this amazing discount, plus other cool freebies when you redeem the online voucher on 12 December 2019! Freebies include the HUAWEI AP38 SuperCharge car charger, a Nova gift box, and a tripod - all amounting to RM285. :D

    <h5 class="mb-1">China Announces A 3-Year Plan To Remove All Foreign Computer Equipments, Software And Replace With Home-Grown Products</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Under a plan dubbed as “3-5-2”, China has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be removed from government offices and public institutions within three years, the Financial Times reported.
China will begin a large scale replacement program under which 30 per cent of foreign personal computer (PC) equipment and software will be removed in 2020, 50 per cent in 2021, and 20 per cent the year after.
The directive by Chinese government is viewed as a setback to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and Microsoft . The plan is seen as a retaliatory step against Washington’s moves to limit the use of Chinese technology, as the trade war between the countries turns into a technology war.
According to the FT report, the directive would result in an estimated 20 to 30 million pieces of hardware needing to be replaced and that this work would begin in 2020.
It remains to be seen how the hardwareand software replacement will be achieved in a three-year timeframe. Chinese government offices promotes the use of desktop computers from the Chinese-owned company Lenovo, but various components of the computers, including its processor chips and hard drives are made by American companies.
On May 16, the US Commerce Department to place Huawei on its entity list which blocks companies from supplying US-sourced technology to Huawei without a license.
Trump Administration has also initiated measures to bar US carriers from using Huawei equipment for next-generation 5G networks on the grounds of national security. Huawei had made massive investment in 5G wireless technology, hoping to lead the world in the race to adopt the new technology.
The United States has charged that Huawei and its widely used technologies is potentially accessed by the Chinese state for its espionage. The company has pushed back on the claim, insisting that it is an independent company with no government ties.
Huawei is the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment and the number two vendor of smartphones, ahead of Apple Inc. and behind Samsung Electronics Co.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wishu, the app that lets businesses book creative freelancers on demand, launches in the UK with €535K raised</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London-based Wishu, the marketplace for creative freelancers, has today announced the launch of its app across the UK. Wishu (founded in 2019) is the world’s first social marketplace app that allows creative freelancers and businesses to negotiate, book and pay for services within the app. Wishu lanches with a total investment of €535K, and a host of major players already on board: Y-Combinator, TechStars, and Momo.
With the rise of freelancing side-hustles, remote teams and co-working offices, it is no surprise that startups like Wishu are popping up to respond to our new ways of working. According to Wishu, there are now 162 million people across Europe and the US freelancing or taking part in the gig economy. Wishu hopes to cater to this trend, as well as suit the communication habits specifically of Generation Z (those born between the mid-1990s to the early 2000s), who will represent 75% of the workforce by 2030. 
Wishu enables creative freelancers in fields such as photography, design, beauty, music, art and dance to spend more time developing creatively, with the app taking care of time-consuming administration and day-to-day practicalities. This is especially important for Generation Z creatives, who are increasingly turning to freelancing as their working mode of choice but find their needs uncatered for in the existing marketplace. The social network aspect of Wishu allows creatives to build a public portfolio, interact with clients, attract requests and bookings, and apply for on-demand jobs posted near them.
On the other side, businesses that want to book local freelancers can do so quickly and easily, by browsing profiles (with user reviews and ID verification), communicating via the chat function, and booking in a single click. They can also post on-demand requests which creative freelancers can apply to. Additionally, Wishu states the cost of hiring talent via the app is lower than through more traditional freelancer agencies.
Moreover, the freelancers themselves are using the app to book other creatives to work with. Wishu has found that early users are likely to book a supporting service through the app, for example a musician booking a photographer for a show, demonstrating a multi-direction marketplace.
Co-founded by three young entrepreneurs – Lavena Xu, CEO, James Johnson, CTO and Hubert Trinkunas, Head of Community – Wishu has also attracted Daniel Evans, formerly Head of Product at fashion social marketplace Depop, to join the team as Head of Product.
Lavena Xu, Co-founder and CEO, said: “The upcoming generation of creatives are increasingly gravitating towards freelancing and a DIY model of building their careers. But they are not receiving the support they need – young creative talents are still spending too much time and energy on the day-to-day tasks of managing their work. Now there is a tool that does the heavy lifting for them in terms of finding work and getting paid.”
“And for those who are booking these freelancers, Wishu offers speed, convenience and security. With all user verification, reviews and payments handled through our system, we give companies and individuals peace of mind,” added Xu.
The Wishu app is available in the App store and is expected to become available on Android in early 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Samsung TV costs Rs 12 crore. Here's why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tech conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co. has created some ripples in the tech industry with the launch of a series of LED TVs titled 'The Wall'.
Now, what is special about 'The Wall'?
Dubbed India's most expensive TV to date, 'The Wall' series starts from Rs 3.5 crore and goes all the way up to a whopping Rs 12 crore. Excluding taxes. Available in three models, 146 inches (4k resolution), 219 inches (6k resolution) and 292 inches (8k resolution), the modular Micro LED display was first unveiled at the CES 2019 event in Las Vegas earlier this year.
The first in its league, no other TV in India comes close enough to stand up to 'The Wall' when it comes to the price point.
Aptly named 'The Wall,' the TV comprises six-by-six inch LED panels that make up the screen. 
The Wall Luxury and The Wall Pro
Samsung plans to roll out two versions of the TV - The Wall Luxury and The Wall Pro. While the former would cater to home cinema and gaming experiences with the features of a smart TV, the latter would be a customisable option for business, corporate and retail environments, said MoneyControl.    
The TV, which was also the 2019 CES Best of Innovation Award winner, finally made landfall in the country early December and is available exclusively at the  Samsung Executive Briefing Centre in Gurgaon, as per a Firstpost report.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Airtel Launches No-expiry Data and Voice Bundles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Airtel Kenya on Monday, December 9, launched no expiry data and call rates that will allow customers to spend as low as 1 bob for 5MB data and to make calls at 2bob across all networks.
At the same time, the company also revamped its entire Amazing data bundle offerings to give more data for the same cost as before e.g. 3GB for Kshs300 up from 1.5GB, 5GB for Kshs500 up from 4GB and 12GB for Kshs1000 up from 10GB with 30days validity.
The new offerings are targeted towards customers who are looking to meet their communication needs with ease and not worry about any hidden costs or conditions. To active the new rates, customers need to dial *544*2#.
The new products campaign dubbed ‘BeSureNaAirtel’ is pegged on showing customers the exact rates and value they get for their investment. The new offers have no hidden charges or conditions for use, thus customers are assured of getting what they pay for at the most competitive rates.
Speaking at the launch event, Airtel’s Managing Director, Prasanta Das Sarma stated, "We are pleased to introduce the industry’s best no expiry rates for data and voice to all our customers. We have also revamped our Amazing data bundles to cater for our heavy data users, by offering up to 100% more data."
"These new offerings are based on emerging consumer insights and trends that show a substantial increase in data usage for both social and business needs as well as the need for customers to not worry about the cost of data while browsing," he stated.
He expressed his confidence that the new rates and revamped bundles will meet all the communication needs of Airtel’s customers even with as low airtime balance as Kshs1.
Airtel continues to invest in the business to bring more innovative products and services and enhance its network coverage.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAPS’s top management seeks to remind the public that while the festive season exudes joy and excitement, this period also breeds sophisticated criminals armed with the latest scams and technology to extort hard-earned money.Mindful of this, the police compiled safety tips to ensure that citizens are ahead of criminals.
These safety tips are aimed at contributing to the safety and security of people during the holiday season.Shopping:· Shop during daylight hours if it is possible. If you must shop at night, ensure that a friend or family member accompanies you.· Avoid wearing expensive jewellery.· Do not carry a purse or wallet in your hand, if possible.· Always carry your driver’s licence or identification card along with the necessary cash, cheques or a credit card at all times.· Even though you are in a rush and thinking about a thousand things, be aware of your surroundings.· Avoid carrying large amounts of cash.· Pay for purchases with a cheque or credit card, if it is possible.· Keep cash in your front pocket.· Notify the credit card issuer immediately if your credit card is lost, stolen or misused.· Keep a record of all of your credit card numbers in a safe place at home.· Be extra careful if you carry a wallet or purse. They are the prime targets of criminals in crowded shopping areas, transportation terminals, bus stops, on buses and other rapid transit.· Avoid overloading yourself with packages. It is important to have clear visibility and freedom of motion to avoid mishaps.· Beware of strangers approaching you for any reason. At this time of year, con artists may try various methods of distracting you with the intention of taking your money or belongings.
