    <h5 class="mb-1">TikTok’s Biggest Hits of the Year — and Its Predictions for 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TikTok has released the TikTok 100, a year-in-review list that names the top videos, genres, creators and memes that shaped the fastest-growing platform of the past year. The list highlights popular TikToks in topic areas like beauty and style, sports, pets and dance trends.
The most viral videos on the app included a science experiment conducted by YouTube star David Dobrik, a man doing surgery on a banana and a swimming pool stunt gone terribly wrong. Top memes on the app included #TikTokChecks (a format where users show off locations or objects as markers of their identity), VSCO girls (a youthful subculture consisting of scrunchies, Hydro Flasks and environmentalism) and “walk a mile,” in which people create high-heeled shoes out of absurd objects in a riff on an Iggy Azalea song.
“The thing that continues to inspire me is how much diversity and amazing content there’s been on the app,” said Vanessa Pappas, the general manager of TikTok North America and Australia. She pointed to the breakout success of Lil Nas X and the impact the platform has had on the music industry as a highlight of this past year. “TikTok has become a hotbed of talent, and there’s so much discoverability on the platform that it can be used as this mechanism to discover new voices,” she said.
The list, which incorporates views, likes, shares and trends into its rankings, showcases TikTok’s power to generate conversation and drive meme culture. It also shows the app’s role in introducing an entirely new type of notoriety into the online attention economy: TikTok fame. Being “TikTok famous” is a mark of status for teenagers. Clubs have sprung up to help those seeking it; countless young people goof off in their bedrooms with their phones for hours, hoping for a hit.
TikTok fame is different from fame on other social platforms like YouTube, Twitter or Instagram. Because TikTok primarily serves viewers through its algorithm-driven feed, you don’t need a single follower on the app to have a video blow up. You just need to tap into the right trend, or do the right dance at the right time.
“There’s something really attainable about TikTok fame. Anyone can post a video and it can be seen by hundreds or millions of people,” said Ms. Pappas. From there, fame happens fast. TikTok creators on the TikTok 100 include Noen Eubanks, who made his first video a year ago in September and now has more than 7 million followers. Others include Chase Hudson, @ThisAintJay and Charli D’Amelio.
“When we think about TikTok it’s this mobile-first platform and there’s so many things about the format itself that speaks to meme culture,” Ms. Pappas said. “Anyone can have a viral moment. Often we see creators take a topic and put their own spin on it and it really does have this viral effect. Because TikTok tends to lower the barrier of entry, creation is really being democratized.”
As the platform continues to birth new creators, Ms. Pappas said helping them make money is something the company is thinking hard about. She previously worked at YouTube and is deeply familiar with the tensions that arise between those seeking to make a living on social platforms and the platforms themselves.
“Creators are such an important part of our ecosystem, and monetization is something we hear often,” Ms. Pappas said. “We’re at the beginning stages of exploring different models and ways we can connect creators with brands and opportunities. We recently rolled out TikTok’s creator marketplace that connects creators to brands. We’re definitely in that exploratory phase, but we’re focused on what ways we can best serve our creative community.”
Serving that community also means broadening what many would consider traditional creators or influencers. “The definition of ‘creator’ is changing,” Ms. Pappas said. “We’re seeing this next generation of creators being born in ways we haven’t seen previously. For me, what’s been interesting is that now anyone can become a creator. People are owning their own voice, not having to express a polished version of themselves. When you look at other platforms there’s different versions of yourself you’re putting out there, TikTok is about being yourself, warts and all, and this new generation of creators is really embracing that.”
It’s not likely that news will be the company’s future focus. “There are so many outlets to find breaking news, so I don’t see TikTok as being a place for that. We’re not a real-time platform,” Ms. Pappas said.
However, the app is becoming increasingly political. Young activists use TikTok to spread political messages; users of all ages have begun leveraging the platform to share opinions on issues surrounding the impeachment inquiry, Trump administration policies, the 2020 election and more.
Misinformation is something the company says it’s deeply concerned about heading into 2020. “I think as a platform of scale you can’t not think about these things today and there’s a level of responsibility we have to take on,” Ms. Pappas said. “We want to make sure we’re safeguarding our users from things like misinformation. We have a number of things we’re beefing up: our policies, ensuring we have expert moderators who know how to define that type of content, what is misinformation, and ensuring we have the technology in place to scan for things like coordinated abuse. We’re looking across the industry and looking at what we can learn from.”
Because TikTok is owned by Chinese tech conglomerate, Bytedance, the app has also faced charges of political censorship. According to The Washington Post, employees of TikTok in the U.S. were pressured to censor “culturally problematic” content that might offend the Chinese government.
“This is something that I want to wholeheartedly stress: We do not censor any content based on political sensitivities,” Ms. Pappas said. “Everything from the U.S. market is driven from the U.S. team. We have U.S. moderation team, our head of trust and safety is in the U.S., it’s a U.S.-led operation. We don’t do any type of censorship in that regard and wouldn’t even if we were asked.”
As TikTok continues to scale in the U.S., Ms. Pappas said American TikTok culture has already begun to affect international markets. “I think today’s list of the top 100 is a really good example of everything that’s resonating from the U.S. globally. We’ve seen effects that have gone viral in other markets, like green screen and TikTok text. It’s been great to see how those trends have gone across barriers.”
TikTok stars also are taking on the wider internet as they spread across platforms, racking up as many as millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram. Ms. Pappas has a goal that they don’t abandon the app for greener pastures. “Creators are really the heart and soul of the app,” she said. “We want to make sure we’re supporting them, they’re creating the amazing content people are coming to see every day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologizes for Christmas sweater depicting Santa with cocaine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(CNN) — Walmart is saying sorry for making available a Christmas sweater with an apparent drug reference.
The sweater featured an image of Santa Claus behind a table with three white lines that look similar to cocaine lines. Below the image is the phrase “Let it snow.” The Global News, a Canadian news organization, first reported the apology.
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” Walmart said in a statement on Saturday. “We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offence this may have caused.”
The sweater did not appear to be available as of Sunday night. Walmart declined to comment further on Sunday.
Third-party sellers are able to make products available on Walmart Marketplace — a portal on which Walmart can approve sellers to use its website.
Walmart has faced similar issues before. In 2017, the company apologized for an offensive slur used by a third-party seller in a product listing on its website.
And it’s not the first time this holiday season that a third-party seller has brought scrutiny to a major online retailer. Earlier in December, Amazon pulled Christmas ornaments showing the Auschwitz concentration camp. Images used showed the train tracks leading to the entrance of Auschwitz II-Birkenau and a number of scenes inside the camps, where around 1 million Jewish people are estimated to have been killed during World War II. Amazon removed the products when the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted about them.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Walmart Canada has issued an apology for selling a jumper on its site that appears to show Santa Claus doing cocaine.
The item of clothing shows Saint Nicholas sitting behind a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him, captioned with the slogan: “Let it snow.”
The product’s description on the Walmart Canada website stated: “We all know how snow works. It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.
“That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.”
A spokesperson for Walmart has apologised for the sale of the product, adding that it has been removed from the company’s Canadian website.
 
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” the spokesperson told Global News.
“We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.”
The jumper was produced by clothing retailer Fun Wear.
Other items created by Fun Wear that are still available to purchase on Walmart’s Canadian site include a jumper depicting a mugshot of Santa Claus, a sweatshirt featuring an illustration of Santa engaged in a fight with a bear and a Chanukah sweatshirt designed with a menorah and captioned with the slogan: “Lit.”
Other items of clothing, including a sweatshirt that showed Father Christmas standing in front of a fireplace without his trousers on, have been removed from the Walmart Canada website.
A range of Christmas cards featuring the Virgin Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus recently sparked anger among members of the Christian community, who described them as “deeply offensive”.
One of the cards includes the caption: “Mary just needs to admit she slept with someone else.”
“It highlights a fundamental hypocrisy that Christianity is seen as fair game to mock, disparage and insult,” said James Mildred, communication manager of Christian Action Research and Education (CARE).
The Independent has contacted Walmart for comment.

Walmart Canada apologized after several adult-themed sweaters were posted for sale on its website, CNN reported. According to Global News, a Canadian news organization, one of the sweaters included Santa Claus and a drug reference.
One sweater depicts a wide-eyed Santa Claus and three lines of a white, powdery substances that are implied to be cocaine, the website reported. The shirt had the slogan "Let it snow" emblazoned on its front.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologises for Christmas jumper of Santa doing coke</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is universally accepted that holiday jumpers are generally quite ugly, cheeky or just a bit naughty.
However, one company got it wrong when they released a jumper that appears to have a design of Father Christmas doing cocaine.
Walmart Canada has issued an apology after being called out for selling the narcotics-inspired design on its website.
The jumper shows a very jolly Santa Claus, with wide pupils, sat in front of a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him.
He also seems to be holding something thin and white in his hand, which is potentially meant to resemble a straw.
‘We all know how snow works,’ the product description reads.
‘It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.
‘That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.’
Walmart has announced that the item, which is sold by a third party retailer called Fun Wear, has now been removed from its Canadian website.
‘These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,’ the spokesperson told Global News.
‘We have removed these products from our marketplace.
‘We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.’
Fun Wear still has other options available on the site, including a design of Santa Claus getting his mugshot at the North Pole police department.
If you haven’t picked up an outfit for Christmas Jumper Day yet, here are some fantastic patterns to choose from this year – from David Attenborough’s face to retro classics.
You can also make a statement this year, after PETA released a terrifying jumper that features a mutilated sheep.
Or just do like Scrooge and skip out altogether.
Metro.co.uk has contacted Walmart Canada for further comment.

The festive season is a busy time for Santa Claus. The whole world, one night, a f*ck-load of presents – how does he keep the energy up?
Well, if Walmart’s adult-themed yuletide jumpers are anything to go by, it isn’t thanks to milk and cookies. No no, Santa favours ‘quality, grade A, Colombian snow’.

Walmart Canada has now issued an apology after some controversial (and hilarious) sweaters were listed for sale on their website.
A Walmart spokesperson told Global News: 
Of all the jumpers, the highlight is one featuring a wide-eyed Father Christmas, sitting in front of three lines of a white substance – I’m guessing it’s not sugar.
Created by clothing company FUN Wear, and called the ‘Let It Snow Ugly Christmas Sweater’, it had Twitter users in stitches.

The product description, now taken down from the website, read: 
While some weren’t exactly pleased about this narcotics-loving Santa, others loved it. One Twitter user wrote: ‘This is the best ugly Christmas sweater copy ever written.’
There were other jumpers too: one featured St. Nick ‘roasting his chesnuts on an open fire’, another saw Santa lying on a table with his pants down as an alien prepares to probe him.

The product description for the latter read: 
We all love a bit of fun around Christmas, but you need to draw the line somewhere.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel creates chip to control quantum computers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Quantum computers aim to carry out tasks in just a few minutes that would take today’s best conventional computers thousands of years. But in nearly every photograph of the devices, there’s a tangle of wires in the background connected to equipment that controls the quantum computer.
Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Monday announced a chip that it hopes will change that. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker announced a chip called “Horse Ridge” that is designed to take all the work being done by the wires and shrink it down to a chip and electronics about the size of a tea cup saucer.
Quantum computers remain years away from everyday use but have drawn the interest of major technology companies. In October, researchers at Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google said they had created a machine that can outpace conventional computers. Other major technology firms such as International Business Machines (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are also pursuing the technology.
Intel has two quantum efforts, each examining a different way of building the core of a quantum computer. That central part of a quantum machine uses what are known as “qubits.”
In many quantum computers, the qubits must be kept very cold, near the temperatures where atoms stop moving, inside a special refrigerator. That makes it very difficult to connect wires to the qubits to send and receive information. Most of those wires and additional electronics have to sit outside the special refrigerator.
Intel said its chip - which is named for one of the coldest spots in the U.S. state of Oregon, where many of its factories are located - is designed to be able to sit inside the quantum refrigerator. The company hopes the chip will make its quantum computers more practical to produce in the future.
“Intel recognized that quantum controls were an essential piece of the puzzle we needed to solve in order to develop a large-scale commercial quantum system,” Jim Clarke, Intel’s director of quantum hardware, said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Making Pixel more helpful with the first Pixel feature drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Your phone should get better over time. Your Pixel automatically updates regularly with fixes and improvements. Now, your Pixel will also get bigger updates in new Pixel feature drops.  Our first one, coming this month, includes a new way to capture portraits, easier Duo calls and automatic call screening. 
Now, you can turn a photo into a portrait on Pixel by blurring the background post-snap. So whether you took the photo years ago, or you forgot to turn on portrait mode, you can easily give each picture an artistic look with Portrait Blur in Google Photos. 
With our latest update to Call Screen on Pixel 4 in the US, the Google Assistant now helps you automatically screen unknown callers and filter out detected robocalls before your phone ever rings, so you’re not interrupted by them. And when it’s not a robocall, your phone rings a few moments later with helpful context about who is calling and why. Call Screen works on your device and does not use Wi-Fi or data, which makes the screening fast and the content private to you.
Video calls are better on Pixel 4 with new Duo features that let you focus on conversations instead of logistics. Auto-framing keeps your face centered during your Duo video calls, even as you move around, thanks to Pixel 4’s wide-angle lens. And if another person joins you in the shot, the camera automatically adjusts to keep both of you in the frame.
Now, the playback on your Duo calls is even smoother, too. When a bad connection leads to spotty audio, a machine learning model on your Pixel 4 predicts the likely next sound and helps you to keep the conversation going with minimum disruptions. Pixel 4’s Smooth Display also reduces choppiness on your video feed, refreshing up to 90 times a second.
When you make Duo video calls on Pixel 2, 3 and 4, you can now apply a portrait filter as well. You’ll look sharper against the gentle blur of your background, while the busy office or messy bedroom behind you goes out of focus.
In addition to new features for Pixel 4, we’re also bringing new apps and features to Pixel 2, 3 and 3a:
In addition to these new experiences, all Pixel devices will also receive an update to its memory management in the feature drop. With this new enhancement, your phone proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more.
Pixel phones have always received monthly updates to improve performance and make your device safe. Now, feature drops will bring more helpful and fun features to users on a regular basis to continue to make your Pixel better than ever. 
These features are already rolling out, and will hit Pixel devices in the coming weeks. To get the new features, update to the latest version of Android and go to the Play Store to start downloading your updated apps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google announces new update with several new features for Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google today announced that it will be delivering new updates called “Pixel feature drops” for Pixel devices from now on. Until now, Google only released regular updates with fixes and improvements. The first Pixel feature drops releasing this month comes with several new features and improvements.
Portrait mode for all photos:
Google now allows you to turn any photo into a portrait on Pixel by blurring the background. Yes, this works for photos that you took years ago. Even when you forgot to take the photo on portrait mode, you can use this feature to add blur in Google Photos.
Avoid robocalls:
With the improved Call Screen feature on Pixel 4, your Pixel can automatically screen unknown callers and filter out detected robocalls before your phone ever rings. This new Call Screen feature works without using internet.
Improved Duo video calls:
New Auto-framing feature in Duo keeps your face centered during your video calls. When another person joins you in the shot, the camera will automatically adjust to keep both of you in the frame.
To make audio during video calls even better, machine learning model on your Pixel 4 predicts the likely next sound and helps you to keep the conversation going with minimum disruptions. When you make Duo video calls on Pixel 2, 3 and 4, you can now blur your background.
Better GPS accuracy:
Google now offers faster accuracy in Google Maps with improved on-device computing for much better location quality.
Better RAM management:
Google is improving the memory management in all Pixel devices. With this new update, your Pixel proactively compresses cached applications so that you can run multiple apps at the same time.
In addition to the above new features for Pixel 4, older Pixel devices (Pixel 2, 3 and 3a) will receive the following updates:
These new features will be coming to Pixel devices in the coming weeks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls and center your Duo videos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To keep its phones from steadily getting worse over time, Google plans to roll out bigger updates, called feature drops, to its Pixel devices. The first feature drop, rolling out this month, will bring the latest Call Screen features and improved Duo video calls to the Pixel 4. And even if you have a slightly older Pixel, the feature drop will let you add Portrait Blur to photos you've already taken.
The Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls using Call Screen. The feature will silently filter out junk calls. If it's not spam, you'll get a description of who's calling and why, so you can decide whether you want to answer. Because Call Screen works on the device, it won't use Wi-Fi or data.
Google is making a few changes to Duo calls, too. On the Pixel 4, Duo will keep you centered in the video frame as you chat. If another person joins you, the frame will automatically adjust to fit them in. If the connection is spotty, a machine learning model on the Pixel 4 will fill in the gaps, guessing which sound was cut out and filling it in, and to reduce video choppiness, Smooth Display will refresh up to 90 times per second.
Pixel 2, 3 and 4 models will also get a portrait filter in Duo, which will blur the background slightly to make you look sharper. You'll be able to apply a similar filter to photos, too. Whether you just took the picture or snapped it years ago, Pixel owners can now add the Portrait Blur in the Google Photos app.
The features are already rolling out, and they should arrive on Pixel devices in the coming weeks. Google plans to make feature drops a regular occurrence, but we don't know what other changes are in the pipeline.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google is adding a bunch of features to all supported Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today, Google announced some new features that are coming to supported Pixel phones, meaning the Pixel 2 or higher. The Mountain View company says that it thinks your phone should get better over time, so it's promising regular "feature drops".
First is the ability to add a portrait effect to existing photos. You'll be able to add the background blur to any photo, whether it's one you just took and forgot to turn on portrait mode, or one that you took years ago. Naturally, this will happen through Google Photos.
There's a new update for Call Screen that uses Google Assistant to filter out robocalls before the phone even rings. And if it turns out to not be a robocall, your phone will ring with more information on who is calling. This feature is actually still exclusive to the Pixel 4 series.
You'll also find improvements to video calls on Duo, such as auto-framing. Your phone will automatically center you in the video, and if someone in the room jumps behind you, it will reframe the shot. You'll also be able to use a portrait mode effect on your video calls, to blur your background. And finally, Google is promising better quality calls, using machine learning to fix choppy audio.
Google also noted a few other things, such as the availability of the Pixel 4's Recorder app on older devices. Live Caption is coming to the Pixel 3 series, Flip to Shhh is coming to Digital Wellbeing on the Pixel 2, and the Pixel 4 is getting the new Google Assistant in the UK, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and Australia. Google will also be releasing an update for all Pixel phones with improved memory management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Verizon kills email accounts of archivists trying to save Yahoo Groups history</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Verizon says the archivists it has blocked breached its terms of service.
Verizon, which bought Yahoo In 2017, has suspended email addresses of archivists who are trying to preserve 20 years of content that will be deleted permanently in a few weeks. 
As Verizon announced in October, the company intends to wipe all content from Yahoo Groups. As of December 14, all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed. The mass deletion includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, database, calendar, attachments, conversations, email updates, message digests, and message histories that was uploaded to Yahoo servers since pre-Google 1990s.SEE: How to build a successful developer career (free PDF)Verizon planned to allow users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, but apparently it has a problem with the work of The Archive Team who wants to save content to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site.  
"Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," reported the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. "Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups – which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."
News of the apparently aggressive move from Verizon was first reported on boingboing.net. The Yahoo Groups Archive Team argues that it is facing a near total "80% loss of data" because Verizon is blocking the team members' email accounts.    The Yahoo Groups site isn't widely used today but it was in the past. The size of the archive that the group is trying to save is substantial and the group had saved about 1.8 billion messages as of late 2018. According to the Archive Team: "As of 2019-10-16 the directory lists 5,619,351 groups. 2,752,112 of them have been discovered. 1,483,853 (54%) have public message archives with an estimated number of 2.1 billion messages (1,389 messages per group on average so far). 1.8 billion messages (86%) have been archived as of 2018-10-28."Verizon has issued a statement to the group supporting the Archive Team, telling concerned archivists that "the resources needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo Groups pages is cost-prohibitive, as they're largely unused".The telecoms giant also said the people booted from the service had violated its terms of service and suggested the number of users affected was small. "Regarding the 128 people who joined Yahoo Groups with the goal to archive them – are those people from Archiveteam.org? If so, their actions violated our Terms of Service. Because of this violation, we are unable reauthorize them," Verizon said."Also, moderators of Groups can ban users if they violate their Groups' terms, so previously banned members will be unable to download content from that Group. If you can send the user information, we can investigate the cause of lack of access." SEE: Yahoo announces all content on Yahoo Groups will be permanently removedAdditionally, Verizon mentioned that the email functionality of the platform will still continue to work, at least for members who haven't been expelled. "While users will no longer be able to post or upload content to the site, the email functionality exists. If you are having issues with this feature, please reach out to YahooGroupsEscalations@verizonmedia.com and we will work to fix the problem with any delay," the Verizon spokesperson wrote. ZDNet has contacted Verizon for comment and will update the story if it responds.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Verizon blocks archivists from preserving 20 years of Yahoo Groups history</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YAHOO OWNER Verizon has blocked the efforts of archivists to preserve almost two decades of history from Yahoo Groups.
Yahoo Groups is just days away from being defunct; the service stopped accepting new content from 28 October, with all scheduled to to be deleted from servers in just five days' time on 14 December.
Content destined for the digital graveyard includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, calendars, attachments, conversations, email updates and message history. 
Though long-neglected, Yahoo Groups still remains one of the biggest repositories of message boards in the world, which is why a group of volunteer archivers - the aptly-named Yahoo Groups Archive Team - is attempting to save all of the content from the service to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site.  
However, its attempts have been hampered by Verizon. While it's actively encouraging users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, the firm is banning the email addresses of the archivists, BoingBoing reports, putting 20 years worth of content at risk of being gone forever. 
"Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," said the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. 
"Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups - which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."
In a statement issued to the group, Verizon told the archivists that "the resources needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo Groups pages is cost-prohibitive, as they're largely unused".
The telecoms giant also said those it suspended from the service had violated its terms of service.
"Regarding the 128 people who joined Yahoo Groups with the goal to archive them - are those people from Archiveteam.org? If so, their actions violated our Terms of Service. Because of this violation, we are unable to reauthorize them," Verizon added.
"Also, moderators of Groups can ban users if they violate their Groups' terms, so previously banned members will be unable to download content from that Group. If you can send the user information, we can investigate the cause of lack of access." 
If Verizon doesn't quickly change its stance - and it doesn't look like it's going to - 20 years of Yahoo Groups data will be gone forever. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Verizon reportedly blocks archivists from Yahoo Groups days before deletion [update]</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An ad-hoc group scrambling to archive as much content as possible from Yahoo Groups ahead of the site's final demise next week is running into trouble as more than a hundred volunteer archivists say Yahoo's parent company, Verizon, has banned their accounts.
Yahoo Groups has been on the wane for years, but Verizon announced its official date of death two months ago. Users were blocked from uploading or posting new content to the site as of October 28, and all content currently on the site is slated to be deleted on December 14—less than one week from now.
Members of the Archive Team have been working rapidly to preserve content from as many groups as possible in that six-week time frame. The volunteers have been using "semi-automated" scripts to join groups rapidly and are using a third-party tool known as PGOffline to access messages, photos, and files not captured by Verizon/Yahoo's data download or export tool. They estimate that as a result of this weekend's blocks, they have now lost access to 80 percent of the material they were attempting to preserve.
One volunteer working on the effort shared a response she received from Verizon in a blog post yesterday. The Verizon representative said the 128 volunteers from Archiveteam.org, who joined groups with the intent of archiving them, were banned for violating the Verizon Media terms of service and would not be able to have their accounts reinstated.
"I understand your usage of groups is different from the majority of our users, and we understand your frustration," the Verizon employee added. "However, the resources needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo Groups pages is cost-prohibitive, as they’re largely unused."
This is not the first time Verizon and the Archive Team have butted heads. Almost exactly a year ago, members of the Archive Team working to preserve Tumblr content had their accounts banned. In that case, however, volunteers found their way around Verizon's block and continued their work within a day.
The Organization for Transformative Works—the nonprofit best known for running the decade-old, Hugo-winning fanfiction site Archive of Our Own—has joined the chorus calling on Verizon to postpone the deletion date by six months, until May 14, 2020, in order to allow volunteers to archive more material.
UPDATE: Late Monday night, Verizon told Ars it would be extending the deletion deadline to Friday, January 31, 2020 at 11:59pm Pacific time.
"We are amazed at the vibrant community Yahoo Groups has become, which is why we want to support our Groups users through the next phase of the transition by providing a way to download previously posted content," the spokesperson said. Individuals can use a Yahoo tool to download their content.
"On Sunday, December 15, 2019, the content will no longer be available or viewable from the groups.yahoo.com site, but we will not delete it until all requests submitted prior to the above deadline have been completed," the spokesperson added.
Archivists, however, will still be prohibited from using third-party tools to scrape any content from groups, and any who do will be blocked.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No matter what phone you use with Google Fi, our phone plan in the U.S., you’ll get great features—like reliable coverage, easy group plans and high speed international data coverage for the same rates you pay at home. 
We’ve been working to bring the Google Fi experience to more people across the U.S., and last year we expanded Fi plans to the majority of Android devices and iPhones. Today, we’re bringing some favorite Fi features to these devices.  
Spam call warnings and the ability to block specific numbers are now available on all phones compatible with Fi—including iPhone—so you don’t have to worry about unwanted calls.
Plus, we are extending our enhanced VPN network and WiFi calling to all Android phones on Fi. When you use our enhanced VPN network, all of your cellular and WiFi traffic are encrypted so you have peace of mind, knowing nobody else can see your online activity. And with WiFi calling, you can make and receive calls as long as you have a WiFi connection, even when you don’t have cellular coverage. 
To use these features, download the Google Fi app and then look for Phone Settings in the app.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Fi brings Wi-Fi calling, VPN, spam warnings to non-Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best Google Fi experience and full functionality is unsurprisingly on Pixel devices that the company has direct input over and access to during development. Today, the MVNO is bringing spam warnings, Wi-Fi calling, and other existing Fi features to non-Google Pixel phones.
As of last year, Google Fi is available for the “majority of Android devices and iPhones.” There is no network switching to take advantage of Sprint and US Cellular, so subscribers using non-Google phones are essentially just on T-Mobile.
Starting today, those Android devices and iPhones now have spam call warnings through their default phone application. Appearing on the incoming call screen, Fi will note “Suspected spam.” Both classes of devices also pick up the ability to block specific numbers.
Meanwhile, Google Fi’s VPN feature is now available for non-Pixel Android phones. All mobile and Wi-Fi traffic gets encrypted to make sure nobody is able to snoop on traffic. Google itself cannot find out what you’re browsing as the VPN is “designed so that your traffic isn’t tied to your Google account or phone number.”
Wi-Fi calling on Android lets you make and receive calls even when you don’t have cellular coverage. This is great for places without good signal, or to conserve data. To get these Google Fi non-Pixel features, update the companionapp and visit “Phone Settings.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Fi brings Wi-Fi calling to more phones, adds spam call warnings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of Google Fi’s big focuses over the last year has been bringing more devices into the fold. This time last year, Google Fi rebranded and expanded to support phones from Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Devices that aren’t “Designed for Fi” miss out on some features, such as network switching, but now Google is bringing some of those extras to more devices.
If you make a lot of phone calls at your house, you know how valuable Wi-Fi calling can be. Even if you live in a well-covered area, Wi-Fi- calling is often more reliable. Wi-Fi calling is a basic feature of Google Fi, but it has mostly been limited to “Designed for Fi” phones. Now, Google is expanding the feature to all Android phones on Google Fi.
On top of Wi-Fi calling, Google is bringing the enhanced VPN network to all Android phones on Fi as well. This is a feature that Google rolled out last year and it has a number of benefits. For starters, it allows the phone to switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data more seamlessly. It also encrypts all Wi-Fi and mobile traffic for added security.
Lastly, spam call warnings and the ability to block specific numbers are available on all phones compatible with Google Fi. If a caller is detected as spam, you will see the caller ID shows “Suspected spam,” and blocking a number works exactly how you’d expect. To find all of these new features, go into the Settings of the Google Fi app and look for “Phone Settings.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Apple TV remote is so bad that a Swiss TV company developed a normal replacement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The remote that comes bundled with the Apple TV is infamous for its difficult-to-use design and controversial touchpad for navigation. It’s so bad, in fact, that Swiss TV and internet provider Salt — which provides Apple TVs as the set-top boxes for its internet TV service — has developed a more traditional remote to replace Apple’s model, via MacRumors.
The optional remote (which costs 19.95 francs, or roughly $20.16) was reportedly developed in collaboration withApple due to complaints from users who were confused by Apple’s touchpad controls. Salt’s remote natively supports the Apple TV right out of the box, with no pairing or setup required — just like Apple’s remote. It also can control a TV set through IR controls, similar to other universal remotes.
But the most notable thing about the Salt remote is just how ordinary it is. There’s a regular four-way control pad for navigation. There are separate play / pause, forward, back, fast-forward, rewind, and stop buttons to control playback. There’s even a dedicated power button! The only thing missing is a Siri button and microphone for activating Apple’s digital assistant. (MacRumors speculates that this absence is due to the fact that Siri services aren’t offered in Switzerland.)
The real question is whether customers in other countries will be able to buy and use the Salt remote. With the reception of the current Apple design, a simpler, easier-to-use option sounds like it’d be welcome in places beyond Switzerland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Swiss broadband provider offers alternative remote control for your Apple TV</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Siri Remote’s been panned for usability issues. Although Apple sells the standard aluminum remote without a touch-sensitive surface, many folks dislike its minimalism. Small wonder that a Swiss provider, which goes by the name The Salt, has decided to offer its broadband subscribers an alternative Apple TV remote with additional buttons.
French blog iGeneration.fr notes that the Salt remote has a Menu button, a four-way directional pad, volume and playback controls, a Mute button, skip and forward buttons and more.
The 9to5Mac observed that to it wasn’t immediately clear from the report whether the remote uses infrared connectivity or takes advantage of the new HomeKit remote feature in tvOS 13. “The Salt remote does not include a microphone for Siri input which suggests its functionality could be supported by just infrared alone,” reads the post.
HomeKit-based remotes for the Apple TV with integrated touch controls and Siri support have been available from the likes of Crestron and Savant for some time now.
Don’t forget that the Apple TV operating software makes it easy to program any universal infrared remote so that you can navigate the entirety of the tvOS interface, and use apps, with the same remote that came with your TV, cable box or DVD/Blu-ray player.
TUTORIAL:How to use a universal infrared remote with your Apple TV
To help turn its Apple TV “hobby” into a viable product, the Cupertino tech giant has negotiated deals with broadband and IPTV providers around the world that permits those companies to offer the Apple-branded streaming device to their customers as a faux set-top box.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mac Pro is finally coming on December 10 — Apple's super-powerful computer that starts at a whopping $6,000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple's $6,000 professional-grade Mac Pro desktop will be available to order starting December 10. That's according to a notification sent to customers who signed up for more information about the Mac Pro through Apple's website, which YouTube personality and tech reviewer Marques Brownlee spotted.
Apple previously announced that the Mac Pro and the $5,000 Pro Display XDR it's selling to go along with it would be available in December, but hasn't revealed a specific date. The Mac Pro was initially expected to be released in the fall. 
 
The new Mac Pro is the long-awaited successor to the 2013-era Mac Pro, which had a cylindrical shape and wasn't very easy to upgrade. The company made significant changes with the refreshed model: it now features a modular design that makes it easy for customers to upgrade individual parts, fixing the primary criticism of the last model. There's also a handle on the top of the computer so that it can be more easily transported to different areas of the customer's workspace if necessary.
The Mac Pro, which Apple announced in June, is designed for professionals in need of a machine that can process heavy workloads rather than the average consumer. App and video game developers, video editors working in the film industry, and those with jobs that require heavy data analysis might be interested in the Mac Pro. 
The new computer will run on an Intel Xeon processor that's configurable up to 28 cores and an optional accelerator card called Apple Afterburner, which the company says can power three simultaneous streams of raw 8K video. It also allows for 1.5TB of memory, which Apple says is the most that's ever been available in a Mac.
When it comes to graphics, the Mac Pro's options start with the Radeon Pro 580X, but the company is also offering a new option called the Radeon Pro Vega II. With that GPU configuration, you'll get 14 teraflops of computing power and 32GB of memory. 
Apple's new Mac Pro has garnered attention in recent months for a different reason as well. The company announced in September that it would manufacture the new high-end computer in the United States at a plant in Austin, Texas, a decision that comes as the United States has been locked in a trade war with China that has resulted in tariffs being imposed on Chinese imports.
Much of Apple's supply chain is based in China, and CEO Tim Cook said on its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call in October that the company has already been paying tariffs on some products. President Trump recently toured the Texas facility where the new Mac Pro is being made, during which the president said he was "looking at" whether the company should be exempt from such tariffs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mac Pro is finally coming on December 10 — Apple's super-powerful computer that starts at a whopping $6,000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s $US6,000 professional-grade Mac Pro desktop will be available to order starting December 10. That’s according to a notification sent to customers, which YouTube personality and tech reviewer Marques Brownlee spotted.
Apple previously announced that the Mac Pro and the $US5,000 Pro Display XDR it’s selling to go along with it would be available in December, but hasn’t revealed a specific date. The Mac Pro was initially expected to be released in the fall.
The new Mac Pro is the long-awaited successor to the 2013-era Mac Pro, which had a cylindrical shape and wasn’t very easy to upgrade. The company made significant changes with the refreshed model: it now features a modular design that makes it easy for customers to upgrade individual parts, fixing the primary criticism of the last model. There’s also a handle on the top of the computer so that it can be more easily transported to different areas of the customer’s workspace if necessary.
The new computer will run on an Intel Xeon processor that’s configurable up to 28 cores and an optional accelerator card called Apple Afterburner, which the company says can power three simultaneous streams of raw 8K video.
Apple’s new Mac Pro has garnered attention in recent months for a different reason as well. The company announced in September that it would manufacture the new high-end computer in the United States at a plant in Austin, Texas, a decision that comes as the United States has been locked in a trade war with China that has resulted in tariffs being imposed on Chinese imports.
Much of Apple’s supply chain is based in China, and CEO Tim Cook said on its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call in October that the company has already been paying tariffs on some products.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight attendants explain the ways you could actually bag a flight upgrade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Booking an economy seat on a flight and landing a fee upgrade to business class or first class is the holy grail of travel.
Unsurprisingly it doesn't happen very often, but the good news is that there are ways you can put the odds in your favour - and now members of cabin crew have revealed just how to do it.
International travel money specialists Equals teamed up with a host of flight attendants and asked them just what it takes to land that coveted upgrade.
Their advice? If you're going to try and blag an upgrade, ask at the check-in desk.
One flight attendant, who works at British Airways, explained: "Some people ask the crew at the door of the aircraft for an upgrade, and some even bring us sweets thinking it will help get them what they want.
"We do get a lot of people asking for a free upgrade, especially if it’s their birthday – but there’s nothing we can do so your best bet is to ask at the desk when you’re checking in."
Asking at the check-in desk doesn't mean you'll get a free upgrade, but it could still land you a cheaper rate if you want to move up to business class.
One cabin crew who works for Virgin Atlantic on long-haul routes said: "Sadly nowadays [getting a free upgrade] is virtually impossible unless you pay for the upgrade as they sell the spare seats at check in. But it’s normally cheaper at check-in so worth a gamble as you could get a good deal."
Joining airlines' loyalty programmes could be another money-saving trick for getting a business class seat without the hefty price tag. These are usually free to join, and mean you can make the most of rewards such as air miles.
A member of Air France's cabin crew revealed: "Passengers can sometimes get themselves into business or first class for less than the normal price, but it depends on how busy the aircraft is. If you have air miles you could try using them to get an upgrade."
Didn't bag the upgrade? That doesn't mean you can't enjoy some luxury - in fact, there are plenty of in-flight extras most people don't think to ask for, but these can actually turn your economy flight into a first class experience.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A lucky UK punter who won £40m in the EuroMillions has still not come forward to collect the life-changing prize.
Whoever won the jackpot in Tuesday’s 3 December EuroMillions draw, may not have even realised they’re a multi-millionaire yet.
The search is on to find the owner of the winning ticket, who matched all five main numbers and two Lucky Stars in the EuroMillions draw last Tuesday.
The winning EuroMillions numbers on that date were 18, 31, 32, 38 and 48, with the Lucky Stars 4 and 12.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PlayStation 5 Pro could launch in 2023, Sony executive hints</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PlayStation 5 is one of the most highly-anticapted gaming consoles in history, and now it seems that Sony is already looking ahead to a follow-up console.
A new report by LetsGoDigital suggests that Sony is already working on the PlayStation 5 Pro.
The report points to a recent interview with GameInformer, in which Sony executive Masayasu Ito indicated that the PS5 Pro is in development.
He said: “In the past, the cycle for a new platform was 7 to 10 years, but in view of the very rapid development and evolution of technology, it's really a six to seven year platform cycle. Then we cannot fully catch up with the rapid development of the technology, therefore our thinking is that as far as a platform is concerned for the PS5, it is a cycle or maybe six to seven years.
“But doing that, a platform lifecycle, we should be able to change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancements in technology.
"That was the thinking behind it and the test case of that thinking was the PS4 Pro that was launched in the midway of the PS4 launch cycle.”
Based on Mr Ito’s statement, LetsGoDigital claims that the PS5 Pro is likely to launch in 2023.
It said: “From this statement it can be concluded that the PS4 Pro was a test case. This advanced console with improved hardware components was introduced three years after the PS4.
“We now know that the release of the PlayStation 4 Pro has become a huge success for Sony. And so the company has reason enough to repeat this marketing strategy.
“Since the PS5 will have a life cycle of around 6 to 7 years, it is likely that the PS5 Pro will be announced in 2023.”
As with all rumours, Sony is remaining tight-lipped, so we’ll just have to wait and see if they’re true!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google adds robocall screening and more to the Pixel 4 in first ‘feature drop’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google plans to start regularly releasing “feature drops” for its Pixel phones, bringing a number of new features to its phones all at once. The first starts rolling out today with a number of updates, including robocall screening and new portrait mode features. There’s also a memory management update that might be a big deal for Pixel 3 owners who have long complained about how the phone handles multitasking.
Perhaps the standout update is an automatic robocall screening feature that’s exclusive to Pixel 4 owners. Google’s phones already have a feature that lets you manually screen calls using its voice assistant, but the feature is now being updated to automatically decline detected robocalls. It looks like the feature will also start automaticallyscreening calls from unknown numbers, then ringing once it has an initial transcript from the person calling. That choice might be a little more controversial than simply swatting away spam, so hopefully Google offers some options on how you want it to work.
Google Photos is also getting a pretty notable portrait mode update: the app can now apply a portrait mode effect to seemingly any photo of a person, even if you never enabled portrait mode while shooting. We’ll have to see just how good that effect turns out since it’s all being done with AI, rather than actual depth data. But there’s no reason Google can’t deliver something as entirely adequate as a typical portrait mode shot with this method, given how filtered they already look.
As part of the “feature drop,” Google is also announcing new video framing effects and quality improvements for Duo video chats, highlighting the expansion of the Recorder app to the Pixel 2, 3, and 3A, Live Caption to the 3 and 3A, and rolling out some Digital Wellbeing updates.
Google also says it’s updating “memory management” on all Pixel devices. Pixel phones will now “proactively compress” background apps, supposedly leading to multitasking improvements. Google says the feature allows Pixels to “run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more,” which is kind of confusing because that is how all smartphones work and a thing Pixels are currently capable of doing... just not very well in all cases.
The Pixel 3, in particular, has been criticized by owners for being overly aggressive about shutting down apps in the background. Google has previously released updates to tweak how the phone handles memory management, but there’s only so much Google can do with the device’s 4GB of RAM.
Google doesn’t say how often feature drops will come along, but it says they’ll be a regular event. The new features are rolling out now and are supposed to hit all phones they’re offered on within “the coming weeks.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US, like China, has about one surveillance camera for every four people, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One billion surveillance cameras will be deployed globally by 2021, according to data compiled by IHS Markit and first reportedby The Wall Street Journal. China’s installed base is expected to rise to over 560 million cameras by 2021, representing the largest share of surveillance devices installed globally, with the US rising to around 85 million cameras. When taking populations into account, however, China will continue to have nearly the same ratio of cameras to citizens as the US.
In 2018, China had 350 million cameras installed for an estimated one camera for every 4.1 people. That compared to one for every 4.6 people in the US where 70 million cameras were installed. Taiwan was third in terms of penetration with one camera for every 5.5 citizens in 2018, followed by the UK and Ireland (1:6.5) and Singapore (1:7.1).
China’s installed base of cameras has recently risen 70 percent, while the US increased by nearly 50 percent.
“During the past few years, coverage of the surveillance market has focused heavily on China’s massive deployments of cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) technology,” said IHS Markit analyst Oliver Philippou. “What’s received far less attention is the high level of penetration of surveillance cameras in the United States. With the US nearly on par with China in terms of camera penetration, future debate over mass surveillance is likely to concern America as much as China.”
There is a difference in how the cameras are implemented, though. In China, most cameras are installed for the purposes of widespread video surveillance of cities, whereas cameras installed in the US are primarily for the purposes of retail and commercial usage. Notably, the Chinese government is reportedly using cameras with facial recognition to profile and track members of Muslim minority groups, a million or more of whom are being rounded up and detained in indoctrination camps.
US cities are split currently on how to deal with facial recognition. As reported by the WSJ, cities like Detroit; Washington, DC; and Orlando are testing it for policing and security, while others, like San Francisco, have officially banned it. IHS Markit says only 3 percent of security cameras installed in the US are for the purposes of city-wide surveillance.
“It should also be noted that while the USA does have a high penetration rate, this installed base has been developed over many years, whereas the Chinese market has developed very quickly over the last decade,” according to Philippou.

The new update will enable cross-platform play between the Xbox One, Windows 10 PCs, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, Gear VR, and now PS4. Minecraft players on the PS4 will also get access to all of their purchases and progress, and the update will be available free of charge.
Microsoft is starting to roll out the Bedrock Edition to PS4 just months after Sony brought its PS4 cross-play support officially out of beta. It also comes two years after cross-play was available for Minecraft on Xbox, PC, mobile, and the Switch. Sony previously blocked cross-play for titles like Minecraft and Fortnite, and after significant Fortnite backlash, the company eventually backed down and changed its policies in September 2018. Since then, Fortnite, Rocket League, PUBG, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare have all included cross-play.
“One of Minecraft’s core missions is to connect players across devices and provide the best experience regardless of platform,” says Minecraft studio head Helen Chiang, in a statement to The Verge. “We continue to fulfill that mission here today by welcoming PS4 players to Minecraft on Bedrock and growing our cross-platform multiplayer community.”
Minecraft is a significant addition to the list of cross-play games, given that there are 480 million players, with 112 million monthly active players. Minecraft was also recently featured in YouTube Rewind 2019, listed above Fortnite as the most viewed video game on YouTube.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many popular headphone models, including Apple’s AirPods, Sony’s WH-1000XM3, and Beats Studio 3, were cheaper than usual during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The latest model of Bose’s flagship wireless noise-canceling headphones, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, were missing from the festivities, but you can now get them for $50 off through Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.
The $50 off brings the total cost of the headphones down to $349. That may not sound like much, but it’s the biggest price drop that we’ve seen on this new model yet. According to The Verge’s Chris Welch, these offer some great features that you won’t find on any other set of cans. Highlights include USB-C charging, but more importantly, voice calls are fantastic. The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth, and the noise cancellation effect is (unsurprisingly) great. This model currently sits atop the rest in our ranking of the best wireless headphones.
Usually, Beats, Bose, and Sony headphones stubbornly hang on to their retail price for quite a while, so if you’ve been waiting for a price reduction for 2019’s finest over-ear wireless headphones, now is your moment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk drove the controversial Tesla Cybertruck near Los Angeles 2 years before its planned release</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla CEO Elon Musk drove the electric-car maker's Cybertruck near Los Angeles on Saturday, TMZ reported. Another video posted on YouTube shows the Cybertruck driving on the 405 Freeway that night, though Musk is not visible.
Photos and videos from TMZ show Musk in the vehicle at the restaurant Nobu. The musician Grimes, who according to media reports has been dating Musk, appears to be one of the vehicle's passengers.
When leaving the restaurant, Musk appeared to disobey and knock down a sign instructing drivers to make only right turns while making a left turn. The sign appeared to have been posted by Nobu, rather than a government agency. 
A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the maneuver.
Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck in November, saying production for models intended for customers would begin in late 2021. While the vehicle's design has been divisive, it has received at least 250,000 refundable $100 preorders, and its listed performance specs top those of the 2020 Ford F-150 in areas like maximum payload and towing capacity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GitHub keen to open subsidiary in China</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GitHub, the world’s biggest software development platform, is looking to open a subsidiary in China, as the Chinese government tries to protect its access to key technology from further US sanctions.
Erica Brescia, GitHub’s chief operating officer, said in an interview with the Financial Times that Beijing was “very encouraging” of the company’s plans to expand in China.
GitHub, which was bought for $7.5bn last year by Microsoft, hosts and manages software development for private companies and is the biggest host of open-source software projects that anyone can take part in.
Ms Brescia said the company was planning a “phased approach”, first looking into setting up a wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China for the purposes of hiring staff, starting with a general manager. After that, the company might explore joint ventures and the possibility of hosting GitHub content in China.
Chinese developers are concerned that they could lose access to GitHub if Washington extends its export sanctions. Some point to the decision taken by GitHub in July to restrict accounts of users in some US-sanctioned countries, such as Cuba and Iran, as a foreboding of what could happen to them. The company has said it would lobby US regulators to prevent the expansion of export controls.
Ms Brescia said the Chinese government was keen for domestic developers to engage more with open-source software to hedge against the risk of being cut off from US-developed software as trade tensions continue. Since open-source software is publicly and freely available for us, it is exempt from US sanctions.
Without GitHub, Chinese companies would lose access to the code of open-source software, leaving their programs stuck in the past.
Some open-source software is critical to the internet; Apache’s open-source web server software, for example, is used to run one-third of all websites, and its development is supported by a US-based foundation.
“What [government ministries] told us is, they believe that open-source is a great way to build on the innovation of others, but obviously it gives more of a sense of security because it’s not subject to any trade restrictions in the US,” Ms Brescia said on the sidelines of the company’s first community event in Beijing.
“I think there has been a strategic push in China around open-source in general because it gives you a way to connect with the rest of the development world, without building on proprietary technologies,” she said, adding that the company had met officials from the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which regulates the telecoms industry, as well as the Ministry of Public Security, which runs the police force.
While other foreign tech companies have found their platforms blocked from Chinese users, GitHub has remained accessible. Earlier this year Chinese developers took advantage of the platform’s lack of censorship to organise a workers’ rights campaign against long hours which is still hosted on the platform.
The company publicly posts government takedown notices, saying it does so “to document their potential to chill speech”.
So far such notices have come from Spain, Russia and China. All five notices from China received this year were requests from the MPS to take down content related to Falun Gong, a religious group that has been harshly repressed in China.
Ms Brescia admitted that the company faced a potential challenge in both defending its transparency standards and building out a team in China, if the Chinese government were to change its stance towards the takedown notices.
“Ideally we will continue to operate in the same way we always have. If we can’t, that’s going to involve a pretty involved discussion. It’s core to who we are that we operate with that level of transparency,” said Ms Brescia.
Beijing is also trying to develop its own open-source projects. Earlier this year Huawei, who is currently blocked from most of its US suppliers, announced it was combining forces with the government and other domestic tech giants to set up a foundation to stimulate open-source software development at home.
“If China doesn’t have its own open-source community to maintain [open-source] code, all of China’s software industry is at great risk,” Wang Chenglu, Huawei’s director of software, said at the company’s developer conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brussels asks news groups to describe their data deals with Google</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The European Commission has sent detailed questionnaires to news publishers as it tries to understand whether the way Google collects data from their websites allows it to stifle competition in online advertising.
The questionnaire, seen by the Financial Times, asks news publishers to explain how Google tracks user activity and browsing data from their sites in order to subsequently personalise adverts.
“Describe any agreements . . . based on which Google collects data from your company or is allowed to obtain data from users of your websites or apps,” said one question, asking the publishers to describe the scope, duration and rationale for their deals with Google.
The questions also ask whether Google provides any technical support or compensation in exchange for the data.
In a sign of how the commission’s antitrust investigators are trying to shape a case against Google, the questions focus on whether the internet company is using its dominance to force publishers into sharing data, and whether that data is then repackaged and sold on by Google to third parties, giving any of its advertising clients the same information that news websites have about their readers.
The questions also examine whether data from news publishers is aggregated into Google’s overall profiles, giving the search group an ever greater advantage in how it can tailor adverts.
The questions to publishers are part of a wider look by the commission at the implications for competition of Google and Facebook’s data collection practices, announced just days after Margrethe Vestager started a second five-year mandate as competition commissioner.
So far, investigations into the use of data have largely focused on the privacy of end users. Respondents have until January 15 to send their replies.
Publishers have long complained that Google has abused its market power, both in how it presents search results for news and in the way it runs its digital advertising business.
In a recent policy paper sent to Ms Vestager, the European Publishers’ Council calling for an investigation into how Google and Facebook use “the troves of data collected across their properties through pervasive user surveillance to dominate search and (social) display advertising respectively”.
The publishers argue Google, through control of data, has an indispensable position on both the buy-side and the sell-side of the digital advertising market. “This creates a situation whereby the dynamics by which auctions are run are unclear; data from those auctions is inconsistent and patchy and where Google is positioned to act in a way that enables it to both prioritise its own inventory, and outbid its rivals,” the EPC argued in its paper.
Antitrust lawyers expect the probes will lead to new cases being opened against Google in Brussels and may influence tougher rules on how Big Tech should treat data when it comes to its agreements with rivals.
The questionnaire also focuses on how news websites themselves collect and use different types of data.
“Please explain how your company collects data from users ( . . . ) data you collect when users are setting up accounts on your websites/apps, when they are signing in for a newsletter,” reads one of the questions.
The European Commission declined to comment on the questions sent to the news groups on Friday.
But in the past, the commission has said that questionnaires on the search company’s collection and use of data constitute part of an ongoing preliminary investigation.
Google declined to comment but has noted previously that publishers around the world made more than $14bn using advertising tools provided by Google last year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Over 750,000 applications for US birth certificate copies exposed online</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An online company that allows users to obtain a copy of their birth and death certificates from U.S. state governments has exposed a massive cache of applications — including their personal information.
More than 752,000 applications for copies of birth certificates were found on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage bucket. (The bucket also had 90,400 death certificate applications, but these could not be accessed or downloaded.)
The bucket wasn’t protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew the easy-to-guess web address access to the data.
Each application process differed by state, but performed the same task: allowing customers to apply to their state’s record-keeping authority — usually a state’s department of health — to obtain a copy of their historical records. The applications we reviewed contained the applicant’s name, date-of-birth, current home address, email address, phone number and historical personal information, including past addresses, names of family members and the reason for the application — such as applying for a passport or researching family history.
The applications dated back to late-2017 and the bucket was updating daily. In one week, the company added about 9,000 applications to the bucket.
U.K.-based penetration testing company Fidus Information Security found the exposed data. TechCrunch verified the data by matching names and addresses against public records.
Fidus and TechCrunch sent several emails prior to publication to warn of the exposed data, but we received only automated emails and no action was taken. We are not naming the company. When reached, Amazon would not intervene but said it would inform the customer.
We also reached out to the local data protection authority to warn of the security lapse, but it did not immediately comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft to finally shut down to-do list app Wunderlist on May 6, 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft has for years promised it would eventually shut down to-do list app Wunderlist, which it acquired in 2015, in favor of its own app, To Do — after it felt the latter was able to offer a competitive experience that included Wunderlist’s best features. Today, Microsoft is finally announcing a shut-down date for Wunderlist of May 6, 2020. After this date, Wunderlist to-dos will no longer sync, but users will still be able to import their content into Microsoft’s own To Do app.
Some Wunderlist users may be disappointed but, to be fair, Microsoft allowed Wunderlist to operate far longer than expected, compared with how most acquisitions of this nature tend to go. And the company prepared Wunderlist users for the app’s inevitable closure as far back as April 2017.
In the meantime, Microsoft has been working to ensure that users’ favorite features — like list groups (folders), steps (subtasks), file attachments, sharing and task assignments — made their way over to Microsoft To Do.
In September, Microsoft unveiled another upgrade for To Do which hinted the Wunderlist shut down could be nearing, with the addition of new backgrounds, smart lists and a personalized daily planner offering smart suggestions of tasks to be accomplished. It also integrated To Do with other Microsoft apps like Outlook, Microsoft Planner, Cortana and Microsoft Launcher on Android.
At the same time, Wunderlist’s creator Christian Reber took to Twitter to express remorse over Wunderlist’s coming closure, and even suggested he would buy the app back if allowed. Reber wasn’t expressing sour grapes, necessarily, but rather a desire to fulfill his original vision for the app, which included building out features like shared folders and cross-team collaboration, for example. (Reber is currently involved with a new content collaboration startup, Pitch, which he co-founded. So returning to Wunderlist never really seemed feasible.)
Microsoft says it decided to now move to close down Wunderlist because it has stopped releasing new features for the app and, as the app ages, it will become more difficult to maintain. In addition, it wants to at last focus its full energies on making its To Do app the best alternative to Wunderlist.
While Wunderlist to-dos will no longer sync after May 6, 2020, the app will be supported until that time. As time goes on, Microsoft will make no guarantees that everything will continue to work properly after the end date.
Microsoft also says that, as of today, it’s no longer accepting new sign-ups for Wunderlist in preparation for the app’s closure.
To make the switch, To Do users can access the iOS, Android, Mac, PC or web app to use the Wunderlist importer. (A link to the importer is in the Settings.) You also can choose to export lists from Wunderlist to To Do from the Wunderlist app, if you prefer.
Once your content is properly imported, users can switch over to To Do, which now features a similar design following the fall update, but introduces new features as well, like the personalized My Day home screen. In addition, Microsoft Outlook emails and Planner tasks can now be sent to To Do. Meanwhile, a Planned Smart List will show everything with a due date, and this can be configured to only show today’s tasks, if you prefer.
“Some of you have been on this journey with us since the very beginning,” said Microsoft, in an announcement. “You, our users, mean everything to us, and we hope that you continue to share our vision and join us on this next step of our journey. You helped us make Wunderlist what it is, and we’d love for you to help us do the same with To Do. Tell us what you love and what you’d like to see added or updated. With our latest additions – printing, smart due dates, and dark mode – you can be sure that we always take your feedback into consideration when building new features,” the company said.
Wunderlist had 26 million installs globally across iOS and Android platforms since January 1, 2014, according to data from Sensor Tower. Downloads since the app was acquired by Microsoft on June 1, 2015 stand at approximately 18.6 million. And in 2019, the app has been installed by 3 million users, down from 4 million during the same period in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Updates to Incognito mode and your Timeline in Maps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">People turn to Google Maps to make their lives easier—whether it's getting tips and recommendations tailored to your daily commute, or knowing when your favorite restaurants, grocery stores and places may be the most crowded so you can avoid a long wait in line. Handy tools like this are improved by Location History–when you turn it on, this optional setting helps make Maps more useful for everyone, as well as personalized to your needs.
Throughout this year, we've focused on making it easier to control, manage and delete your Location History information. Location History is off by default, and you can choose to delete all or part of your history automatically when you turn it on. We introduced auto-delete controls so you can choose to keep only three or 18 months’ worth of data—anything older than that will be automatically deleted. Your Data in Maps lets you quickly access your Location History and other privacy controls with just a few taps. And on Android, Incognito mode on Google Maps stops searches or places you navigate to within Maps from being saved to your Google Account.
Today, we have two updates: Incognito mode is rolling out on Google Maps for iOS today, and bulk delete in Timeline will arrive on Android next month.
Incognito mode
Incognito mode on iOS works the same way it does on Android. While in Incognito mode, the places you search for or navigate to won’t be saved to your Google Account and you won’t see personalized features within Maps, like restaurant recommendations based on dining spots you’ve been to previously. Using Incognito mode on your phone will not update your Location History, so the places you go won’t be saved to your Timeline.
Bulk delete in Timeline 
Your Timeline is a tool that uses your Location History to help you easily remember places and routes you’ve visited–and on Android, share them with friends. With bulk delete, you can quickly find and delete multiple places from your Timeline and Location History all at once. You’ll still have the ability to delete all or part of your Timeline by date range from your Location History settings. 
How Location History improves Google Maps
We’re committed to providing simple, easy-to-use tools to manage your Location History—as well as clearly explaining how it makes products more useful. Scroll through the images below to learn more about Google Maps features made more helpful by Location History.
Stay up to date on your Location History settings
It’s our goal to help you stay informed about your Location History. If you’ve chosen to turn Location History on, you’ll receive periodic email reminders that let you know what data you’re saving, and ways you can manage it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Using the web to help young people find work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Africa has the world’s highest recorded youth unemployment rate. Many young people are unable to access job opportunities due to a lack of financial resources and necessary work experience. Allan van der Muelen, the co-founder of start-up Zlto, is changing this. 
Zlto is a web-based digital rewards platform that incentivizes young people to gain work experience by volunteering in the community. Users build a digital resume by uploading completed work assignments, showing both their impact on the project and the skills they gained while completing the task. For each project they also earn Zlto, a digital currency that can be spent on a range of items, like food, clothing, mobile data and transportation, thanks to collaborations with national retail partners. 
“I work with young people to show them that they do have choices and the Web is giving them access to even more,” he says. In 2018, Zlto won the Google Impact Challenge and more recently started working with Chrome engineers to streamline their web app. 
People access Zlto through devices with limited capabilities and with limited data and connections. So providing them with instant access to the platform is critical to the company’s success. By building on the web, the Zlto team was able to make the app widely accessible. A typical Zlto user accesses their web app three times a day, so it’s critical that their experience is reliable. The Zlto team uses modern web technologies to ensure the app is responsive and reliable, and they use tools including Google’s Lighthouse to monitor the app’s performance and make instant fixes.
Zlto is having a notable impact in the Cape Town Flats, securing permanent work for more than 2,300 young people in the last 12 months; there are 36,000 volunteers working with more than 1.2 million people in the community. The team is now piloting the launch of Zlto in Tanzania as well as the United Kingdom, working with the Newbigin House charity in support of asylum seekers and other individuals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Google Play works</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are more than 2.5 billion active Android devices worldwide—and that number is growing. A major force behind that growth is Google Play, the global online content store that brings incredible apps, games and digital content to Android users everywhere.
Today we are publishing the “How Google Play Works” report, a comprehensive look under the hood at how the Play Store operates, focusing on how we keep users safe and how we support developers and help them build sustainable global businesses. 
At Android Dev Summit 2019, we announced that there were over 116 billion downloads from Google Play in the last 12 months. With such scale comes an enormous responsibility to respect and protect everyone involved—both the people downloading the apps, and the developers creating them.
This is why we continually review our Google Play developer policies, which cover topics ranging from bullying and harassment to malware. It’s why we try to scan all apps being installed with Play Protect, even apps that don’t come from Play. It’s also why we invest heavily in helping to make developers successful in sustainable ways that respect our users and their devices.
Creating a global platform for everyone and providing useful tools for developers has been our goal since we launched the very first Android device. 
As content and devices evolve, so will the Google Play Store, and we look forward to bringing developers and users the very best digital discovery and store experience.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Congrats on completing the marathon. What happens now? 
You might notice a drop in your RPMs and impressions. Don’t panic, it’s ok. You didn’t do anything wrong it’s the January blues. Remember that RPMs and internet traffic drive spikes but can also drive drops. As internet traffic decreases after the holiday, it is common to experience a drop in January. This is your RPMs returning to normal. This represents a new opportunity for you to focus on retaining the audience you gained and experiment with your AdSense account. 
Users are still online in January but their searches are different. This could be the time of a year for a perfect match between their searches and your content. Users have many topics on their radar, such as lifestyle, health and travel.
Check Google Trends to find out what search queries were trending in your audience’s location last January.
January isn’t the right time of the year that matches with your content? Good news, there’s a lot of seasonal holidays to watch out for in the following months. Here’s a list of seasonal peaks in 2020. Let’s find yours.
If you are thinking of starting a new site, make sure to take a look at these AMP-first tips. Creating an AMP-first site gives you a high performance - faster page load time, better user experience on mobile and more overall traffic. Review the WordPress themes that make creating an AMP site easy. Create the site, install theme and install the AMP plugin. 
Learn more about themes.
It’s time to have some fun and try out some changes. Is there a feature you wanted to test before the holiday but didn’t get a chance to implement it? Why not try it now? Visit the Optimization tab in your AdSense account. It provides you with bespoke recommendations that could improve performance, and A/B experiments to help you make more informed decisions for your site. 
Learn more about opportunities and experiments.
Take note of each end of quarter in your region. Why? Advertisers tend to spend more at the end of each quarter when they have budget leftover. Remember, an increase in advertiser spent also means potential increase of RPMs.

The three different tip options give a range of different sizes to sit snug in the ear. They have a good range of sounds and rich bass without being tinny. The case automatically charges the ear buds when they are placed back into the holder. Pairing to a device is quick and easy and there is hardly any distortion away from the device whilst playing. You can also configure each ear bud to connect to a different device. Although the sound will be mono, two people can listen to the device they choose. The ear buds deliver about 5 hours play time -- although I only used them for a couple of hours at a time. The case holds enough charge for them to charge a further six times giving up to 30 hours battery life. They are sweat-proof too if you want to use these for sport.
The Destek wireless ear buds have ear hooks to help secure the ear buds in your ear. The ear buds will give up to 8 hours playing time, but the charging case holds up to seven more charges when the ear buds are replaced into the case giving up to 65 hours playing time. This means that you have several days music before you need to recharge the case and buds.These IPX7 waterproof ear buds can wirelessly charge too, and there are 3 different tips to ensure comfort when listening.
The Poweradd speaker is loud. Its small form factor packs in 36W of sound from its 2 x 13W drivers and 2 x 5W subwoofers.  I like speakers with rich bass and this delivers a good range of sound throughout. It is a compact speaker at only 6.81 inches high and it weighs 2.3 pounds. This is a solid speaker which is IPX7 rated, so if you accidentally drop this in the bath, it will still work – and even continue to play music underwater. Crank this up to the max for a really good sound
These noise cancelling ear buds deliver a great range of sound with no distortion when away from the device. They also have TWS -- True Wireless Stereo -- and pair quickly to your device. There are three ear tips for a secure fit, although I did not find these as comfortable as the Tribit speakers.These ear buds are a bit trebly for me -- and the bass did not come up too high at all making me feel that they were a little tinny on some tracks. However, I am a bass fan and your ears might love the rich sounds these speakers deliver.These IPX7 waterproof ear buds have over six hours playing time from a charging time of under two hours, and usefully, the carrying case can be charged wirelessly. You can charge the ear buds from the case a further four times, giving up to 30 hours total play time.
These ear buds have an unusual fit. Instead of an ear hook, these ear buds have a heel on the bud to keep it secure whilst listening to your sounds. The ear buds will give about three hours of play time and the carry case will charge the buds for another four charges giving up to 12 hours play time. These ear buds are only rated IPX4 -- which means that they are splash-proof and sweat-proof -- but do not get them too close to running water. They are reminiscent of Air Pods -- but at a considerably cheaper price. The shape of the cone focuses the sound into your ear canal so you get a really loud sound when the ear buds are fitted correctly.
The PuroBasic wired headphones limit sound to 85db so that children can not turn the sound up too much and potentially damage their hearing. The headphones are wired so they will fit any device that has a 3.5mm jack.
Useful tech gadgets for every geek.
The best durable tech items that will last and last.
It is difficult for me to choose a favorite from this list of speakers -- but one of these will hit the spot for sure, delivering decent sounds when you are back at college.
Get your groove on whilst you are out and about with these superb rugged Bluetooth waterproof portable speakers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cadillac will help you shop for cars in a live virtual showroom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cadillac is moving some of the car shopping process online... if not necessarily the parts you'd want the most. The automaker has launched a Cadillac Live service that lets you check out car features and ask questions through a live video connection to a showroom with iPhone-toting specialists. Effectively, you can conduct the usual dealership tour without having to travel halfway across town. Representatives can also share options like accessories, colors and wheels through a digital interface -- just in case that Escalade on display isn't baller enough.
Live help doesn't run around the clock, but it's still much better than your usual dealer. You can talk to agents between 9AM and 1AM Eastern from Monday through Thursday, 9AM to 9PM Eastern on Fridays, and 11AM to 7PM Eastern on Saturdays and Sundays. Residents of California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas can also join in a pilot that will connect them to a dealership if they want to go on a test drive or complete a purchase.
Notice what isn't an option, though: you can't actually buy a car through the Live service. Unlike Tesla, Polestar and other relative newcomers that can complete transactions online, you'll still have to visit a dealership and contend with arbitrary markups, hidden costs and pressure from sales reps. Cadillac Live is still a significant improvement to the sales process, and gives the brand an edge over online-focused rivals that don't let you virtually kick the tires before you buy. It's just that the company isn't ready to completely enter the 21st century.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cadillac Live lets you browse the showroom floor without leaving home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cadillac earlier this year launched a live virtual showroom for Canadian customers. One part personal shopper, one part interactive digital showroom, the feature allows potential buyers to conduct a one-way video chat with a product specialist so they can learn more about specific Cadillac vehicles from the comfort of their own home.
Seemingly a success, the service is now migrating south of the border for American shoppers.
Unfortunately, it’s really only for lead generation / to educate shoppers as you’ll still need to visit a local dealership to schedule a test drive and to complete a transaction.
Those interested in a vehicle from the luxury division of General Motors can schedule a chat with a live agent between the hours of 9am through 1am Eastern on Monday through Friday, 9am to 9pm Eastern on Fridays and 11am through 7pm ET on weekends. Again, you’ll still need to reach out to your local dealership to move forward with the buying process but at least you’ll be able to do so without going in blindly.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boeing is promising 3 fixes to the faulty autopilot behind the 737 Max crashes to let pilots stop it forcing the plane into an unstoppable nose-dive, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boeing is promising three fixes for the faulty autopilot system widely attributed as a cause of two deadly crashes by the 737 Max plane, CBS News reported Sunday.
The manufacturer told stakeholders in Seattle last week it will introduce changes to the jets Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), CBS News reported, citing documents from a presentation by the company.
The pilots in both crashes had struggled with MCAS, which was designed to automatically push the plane’s nose down to stabilize the jet.
In the first crash, suffered by Indonesia’s Lion Air, MCAS activated at least 20 times before the crash.
The software had relied on data from one of the plane’s two “angle-of-attack” (AOA) sensors, which monitored the plane’s position in the sky.
Both pilots tried to push back against the system by angling the plane back up dozens of times, but MCAS kept reactivating – which ultimately led to the two planes crashing and killing 346 people.
Boeing said it has addressed these problems with updated software, CBS News reported. Here are the changes they plan to make, according to the news network:
Boeing also told attendees that it had flown 1,850 flight hours with the software updates, and spent more than 100,000 employee hours in engineering and test-developing the new issues, CBS News reported.
Multiple Boeing employees have spoken of the company’s internal pressures to develop planes quickly and to keep manufacturing costs down.
Boeing has not yet responded to Business Insider’s request for comment on the reported changes.
The company’s presentation last week was meant to reassure airplane analysts, airlines, pilots, and flight attendants, CBS News reported. Regulators around the world have grounded their 737 Max jets, and pilots and flight staff have publicly expressed fears of flying them again.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had also come under pressure for vouching for the 737 Max’s safety before the two crashes. The agency now wants to dramatically change its certification process.
Internal messages exchanged by Boeing employees in 2016, which were released in October, also suggested that they had known about the MCAS’ problems but misled the FAA about its dangers.
The 737 Max is expected to return to service in March 2020, though Boeing is trying to get it back in the air sooner.

The manufacturer told stakeholders in Seattle last week that it would introduce changes to the jets' Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, CBS News reported, citing documents from a presentation by the company.
Investigators found that the pilots in both crashes struggled with MCAS, which was designed to automatically push the plane's nose down to stabilize it if it detects a stall.
Before a jet from Indonesia's Lion Air crashed last year, MCAS had activated at least 20 times, investigators said.
The software had relied on data from one of the plane's two "angle-of-attack" sensors, which monitored the plane's position in the sky. Both pilots tried to push back against the system by angling the plane back up dozens of times, but MCAS kept reactivating.

Boeing did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the reported changes.
The company's presentation last week was meant to reassure analysts, airlines, pilots, and flight attendants about the 737 Max, CBS News reported. Regulators around the world have grounded those jets, and pilots and flight staff members have publicly expressed fears about flying them again.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has also come under pressure for vouching for the 737 Max's safety before the two crashes. The agency now wants to dramatically change its certification process.
Internal messages exchanged by Boeing employees in 2016 and released in October also suggested they had known about the MCAS's problems but misled the FAA about its dangers.
The 737 Max is expected to return to service in March, though Boeing is trying to get it back in the air sooner.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk spotted hitting the town -- and a sign -- in the Tesla Cybertruck</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla'sCybertruck is still making a smash.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk was spotted chauffeuring a few friends to dinner at Nobu in Malibu, Calif., on Saturday night in a prototype of his company's upcoming electric pickup.
The Cybertruck suffered an embarrassing debut in November when its "armor" windows were smashed by a small metal ball tossed at them.
According to TMZ, the Cybertruck was left parked out front with security and attracting much attention while the party was dining. At one point, Musk came out with actor Ed Norton to give him a look.
As it left the restaurant, Musk's friend, musician Grimes, was photographed sitting next to him on the stainless steel vehicle's central front jump seat, which allows the cabin to fit six passengers, as in many conventional pickups.
The night didn't go perfectly, however. Musk was videotaped running over a sign with the full-size truck as he pulled out of the parking lot onto the Pacific Coast Highway.
Musk tweeted earlier in the evening that the production version of the Cybertruck could be slightly smaller to make it easier to fit in a garage.
Regardless, there's still plenty of work left to do as the truck Musk was driving wasn't equipped with side-view mirrors or a visible windshield wiper.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Companies can track your phone — unless you change these security settings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For big tech companies, data is money. Their goal is to collect as much info about you as they can, and try as we might, there’s no surefire way to shut them out entirely.
There are steps you can take to limit what advertisers know about you, though. It all starts with your Facebook settings. Tap or click here for 7 ways to delete yourself from the internet.
As consumers demand more privacy, tech companies — including smartphone manufacturers — are slowly responding. Apple’s latest iPhone operating system, iOS 13, has several new privacy settings you need to start using if you aren’t already.
The OS brings hundreds of other changes too, like improved camera settings and a quicker way to type messages. Tap or click for 9 iPhone features you’ll use time and time again.
Once your phone is up to date, it’s time to control how often companies track you and get data from your Apple devices. Keep tech companies and hackers at bay with these new privacy features.
Only you need to know where you are
Many apps ask for permission to know your location. In apps like Google Maps, that makes sense, but social media apps and games want to know your location too. Those have less justification. Tap or click here to see which apps are known for stealing sensitive data.
Sure, you might want to share your location on social media if you’re at a cool new place, and geotags on Snapchat are fun to use too. But it can be genuinely dangerous to post your location publicly — anyone could find you. Savvy hackers use location information to deduce details like your address, where you work and even to determine when you’ll be home.
Thankfully, Apple understands how easily criminals can glean information, so in iOS 13 you now have some serious control over what location data you share with different apps.
RELATED: Another new feature in iOS 13? Apple’s new robocall-blocking solution. I hate robocalls, too, but this doesn’t cut it for me. Tap or click to find out why I think it’s a flop.
Apple has always made it possible to disable location services for certain apps, but the controls are now more specific and customizable.
Once you download iOS 13, control your app location permissions by going to Settings > Privacy > Location Services. You’ll see a list of your apps there, and you can decide how often they get to use the location services. This level of control will help keep your data safe, so make sure you use this feature ASAP.
Know when apps are accessing your data
Even if you control when and where your location services are accessed, some apps can be sneaky.
They’ll access your location in the background every so often to glean just a little bit of data. The amount of information they learn adds up over time, but with iOS 13 you can know when apps are trying to sneak around.
With iOS 13, your iPhone will send you notifications when background apps access your location info.
This notification can help you track down the less scrupulous apps, which tend to be big battery drainers and privacy violators.
From there, you can decide whether to change their location permissions via Settings, or decide if you’d rather remove them altogether. You don’t need apps that access your data without permission — not if you want to be safe.
Block back doors for data gathering
Apps can get your location information from your iPhone’s location services, but it’s not the only way.
Some apps can learn location information from your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, just by seeing where your IP address is located or what devices (which can also report locations) your Bluetooth connects to.
This means your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth permissions also impact how much data companies and apps can gather about you — maybe even more so than location services, since many apps don’t bother to ask for your location at all. They just piece it together themselves. So what can iOS 13 help you do about this?
First, iOS 13 lets you decide Bluetooth permissions on every app you use. As with location services, you access this by going to Settings > Privacy > Bluetooth. Once again, you’ll be presented with a list of your apps, and you can decide if they can access your Bluetooth.
There aren’t customizable options for allowing Bluetooth, but because Bluetooth isn’t always secure, it gives you some control over what data which apps can gather. Tap or click here to learn about a major Bluetooth flaw that exposed millions of devices to attacks.
Next, iOS 13 lets you control some aspects of how your iPhone works on Wi-Fi. You can disable tracking in Safari, so data gathered about you on one site can’t carry over onto another. This makes it hard for companies to send you the same ads over and over, because they have less data to work with.
Just go to Settings > Safari > and toggle off Prevent Cross-Site Tracking.
Another feature of iOS 13 includes a secure password autofill. These are passwords stored in the iCloud Keychain that requires your Touch ID or Face ID to confirm your identity before it auto-fills your passwords onto sites and apps. This feature also allows you to connect to a few third-party password apps like 1Password, Dashlane and LastPass.
Note: You can only use this feature, called Apple sign in, if you have two-factor authentication turned on and you need to be signed in to your Apple ID on your Apple device.
Two-factor authentication is one of the most powerful ways to protect your accounts. Tap or click here to learn how 2FA works.
Keeping your information private on your iPhone is easier than ever with iOS 13’s new features. Make sure you upgrade and use them as soon as you can to keep data gathering down and security up. Your iPhone shouldn’t give out all your information, so iOS 13 helps you share only when necessary. Get it today!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies plans to equip more of its products with its Harmony operating system (OS) next year, and will promote them at home and abroad, a Huawei spokesman said on Monday.
But there are no plans currently to roll out the OS to its phones, tablets and computers, among Huawei’s most popular products, the spokesman added.
The plans were first reported in the government-backed Shenzhen Special Zone Daily newspaper, which cited comments made by Wang Chenglu, president of the Huawei consumer business group’s software division, at a store event held in the city of Shenzhen, where the firm has its headquarters.
Huawei unveiled its proprietary OS in August as a possible alternative to Google’s Android, as it copes with trade restrictions by the United States that threatens to cut its access to technology made by U.S. firms.
A “smart screen”, or connected television product, was its first product to use Harmony, called Hongmeng in Chinese, but it said at the time that it would stick to Android for smartphones and gradually roll out Harmony to other devices such as smartwatches, speakers and virtual reality gadgets.
Wang reiterated that stance at the store event and noted the company would still prefer to use Android on its phones, according to Shenzhen Special Zone Daily.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WireGuard VPN is a step closer to mainstream adoption</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As of this morning, Linux network stack maintainer David Miller has committed the WireGuard VPN project into the Linux "net-next" source tree. Miller maintains both net and net-next—the source trees governing the current implementation of the Linux kernel networking stack and the implementation of the next Linux kernel's networking stack, respectively.
This is a major step forward for the WireGuard VPN project. Net-next gets pulled into the new Linux kernel during its two-week merge window, where it becomes net. With WireGuard already a part of net-next, this means that—barring unexpected issues—there should be a Linux kernel 5.6 release candidate with built-in WireGuard in early 2020. Mainline kernel inclusion of WireGuard should lead to significantly higher uptake in projects and organizations requiring virtual private network capability.
Normal, day-to-day Linux users probably won't see in-kernel WireGuard until late 2020. Ubuntu is one of the faster-moving mainstream distributions, and its next Long Term Support (LTS) release is in April 2020. But the Linux 5.6 kernel and Ubuntu 20.04 will likely be in release candidate status at the same time, so its inclusion in 20.04 seems unlikely. The interim 20.10 Ubuntu release seems like a much safer bet for Canonical's first use of a 5.6 or later kernel. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) inclusion will likely be a year or more beyond that; the current RHEL 8.1 shipped in May 2019 with the 4.18 kernel, which was already 9 months old.
Although highly speculative, it's also possible that WireGuard could land in-kernel on Ubuntu 20.04 even without the 5.6 kernel—WireGuard founder Jason Donenfeld offered to do the work backporting WireGuard into earlier Ubuntu kernels directly. Donenfeld also stated today that a 1.0 WireGuard release is "on the horizon."
While WireGuard is most frequently seen in a Linux context right now, it's available and very capable on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and BSD. Although the highest possible performance comes from running in-kernel, the userland implementation typically still handily outperforms traditional VPNs such as IPSEC and OpenVPN, with faster connection times, lower latency, and significantly decreased battery usage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Render shows OnePlus tackling the midrange market with OnePlus 8 Lite</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">2020 will bring all the usual yearly updates from all the usual phone vendors, but one interesting new addition is a cheaper smartphone from OnePlus. The king of value flagship smartphones is making what looks like a midrange device.
The news comes to us from OnLeaks and 91Mobiles, which have whipped up CAD-based renders of the device. OnLeaks says there's no name for the device yet, but for now, the report is going with "OnePlus 8 Lite." The render shows a device with a flat display measuring somewhere around 6.4-inches and a front camera that lives in a hole punch in the middle of the display, just like a Samsung device. The hole-punch camera is apparently the design OnePlus will go with across its lineup—OnLeaks has released "OnePlus 8 Pro" renders earlier, featuring this same Samsung-y front camera design.
Other features on the render include two cameras and a lot of sensors on the back, a USB-C port and speaker on the bottom, and a physical mute switch on the side. It's hard to imagine an Android phone shipping without a fingerprint reader (unless you're Google, I guess), so an in-screen fingerprint reader is probably included. There's no headphone jack, which is a shame for a mid-range device.
The design doesn't really matter, though. What we're mainly interested in are the specs and price, which are mysteries for now. OnePlus regularly delivers the best bang-for-your-buck in the industry, and having the company build something cheaper than a flagship smartphone has the potential for greatness. For now, we'll have to be on the lookout for more info before the launch sometime next year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new on-demand streaming service for movies and TV shows has launched in the UK and unlike rivals such as Netflix or Amazon Prime - the platform is free.
Plex is offering thousands of films, TV shows and web series to stream without charge - including titles such as Zulu, Rain Man, Raging Bull, Lord of War, The Terminator, Apocalypse Now and Thelma and Louise.
Plex says it will continue to add new content on top of its current library of thousands of Hollywood blockbusters, TV shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals and more, reports The Express .
Plex has teamed up with Warner Bros to offer the service - which includes adverts - and has just launched.
All you need to view any of the content is a Plex account, which is free to set-up.
Plex’s library includes content from the major Hollywood studios, including MGM, Lionsgate, Legendary and Warner Bros.
Until now, Plex had been a media library service designed to help you keep your own video content organised and available to stream on any of your devices.
Plex CEO Keith Valory, said: "Plex was born out of a passion for media and entertainment, and offering free ad-supported premium movies and TV shows is just the latest step in our mission to bring all your favorite content together in one place.
"What started more than a decade ago as a passion project to make accessing media on connected devices easier has evolved into the most comprehensive streaming platform in the industry, used by millions of people around the world."
Plex is available to download for free on iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Android TV, Fire TV, macOS, Windows and other platforms

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:36:38 pm
The YZF-R15 Version 3.0 in BS VI follows the introduction of Yamaha BS VI vehicles – FZ FI (149 cc) and FZS FI (149 cc).
India Yamaha Motor (IYM) on Monday launched BS-VI compliant YZF-R15 Version 3.0 motorcycle model with price starting at Rs 1.45 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
The 155cc will be available across all company dealerships in India from the third week of December 2019, IYM said in a statement.
The YZF-R15 Version 3.0 in BS VI follows the introduction of Yamaha BS VI vehicles – FZ FI (149 cc) and FZS FI (149 cc) – in November this year, it added.
The new motorcycle has features such as side stand engine cut-off switch, dual horn and radial tubeless tyre at the rear wheel.
The bike to be available in three colour options are priced between Rs 1.45 lakh and Rs 1.47 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
Commenting on the launch, Yamaha Motor India group of companies Chairman Motofumi Shitara said, “With Yamaha continuing to perk up track performances with the R series, the new YZF-R15 Version 3.0 with BS VI compliant engine and new features will be able to create optimum excitement in India in its respective category”.
Yamaha strived for optimum cost control for the new BS-VI compliant YZF-R15 version 3.0 and achieved to peg it around 3 per cent higher along with new standard features, he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yamaha's BS6-compliant R15 V3.0 sees a Rs 4,400 increase in price compared to the BS4 model.
Exactly a month after Yamaha launched its first BS6-compliant two-wheelers – the FZ and FZ-S – the manufacturer has launched the BS6-compliant iteration of the popular R15 V3.0. Prices for the updated bikes start at Rs 1.45 lakh, which is a hike of just Rs 4,400 over the BS4 model.
The switch to BS6, however, has brought with it a slight drop in power. While the 155cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine on the BS4 version produced 19.3hp at 10,000 rpm and 14.7Nm at 8,500 rpm, this new model produces 18.6hp and 14.1Nm at similar points in the rev range.
The new YZF-R15 V3.0 will be available in three colours – Racing Blue (Rs 1.46 lakh), Thunder Grey (Rs 1.45 lakh) and Darknight (Rs 1.47 lakh). Interestingly, the Racing Blue variant will get blue-coloured wheels, as seen on the bike sold in Indonesia and other Asian markets. This also means we could see the BS6 iteration of the MT-15 receive its quirky wheel colours.
Commenting on the launch, Motofumi Shitara, Chairman, Yamaha Motor India said, “With Yamaha continuing to perk up track performances with the R series, the new YZF-R15 Version 3.0 with BS6-compliant engine and new features will be able to create optimum excitement in India in its respective category.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BioShock is an incredible first-person shooter franchise that deals with the collapse of various isolated communities. Many years ago, the previous developer was shut down by parent company 2K Games, but now, another team has emerged to take its place. Today, we received a press release that recognized the establishment of Cloud Chamber.
According to 2K, Cloud Chamber is "a collective of storytellers eager to push the frontlines of interactive entertainment by making unique, entertaining, and thoughtful experiences." Cloud Chamber will build its team in San Francisco and Montréal. The bigger news is that Cloud Chamber is working on the next iteration of the BioShock franchise. Unfortunately, it's going to be in development for several years because the team wants to get it right. It's unclear where the story will unfold this time around.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Oculus Quest is a standalone virtual reality (VR) headset that has become quite popular in recent months. It allows you to experience the wonders of VR without attaching long cables connecting it to your computer.
The Quest relies on two controllers for inputs, but that's about to change very soon. Today, Oculus announced that hand tracking was coming to the headset this week. The press release Android Central received said that the team wanted to "share that we'll be rolling out an initial version of hand tracking as an early feature for consumers on Oculus Quest this week."
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
The initial release date was pegged in early 2020, but it's coming out sooner than expected. That's great news in my book because I've been wanting to try it out for a while now. Quest users will have to turn on this feature in the Experimental Features menu, then use their hands to navigate and interact within Quest's Home interfaces like Library and Store, plus in select first-party apps like the Oculus Browser and Oculus TV.
Luckily, if you don't like it, you can even switch between your hands and controllers with a new toggle within the Quest Home menu, as well as set the floor height for a stationary Guardian using only your hands. Keep in mind that developers will have to update their games to support hand tracking. It seems like this probably won't happen until 2020. Which games do you want to play with just your hands? Do you think it'll work well? Let us know.
Options to enjoy VR
The Oculus Quest is known for its untethered nature, but now it also has the ability to play PCVR games with Oculus Link. The feature is in beta but allows you to play powerful VR games on a headset that you can then detach from your PC and use on the go.
Oculus recommends this cable for trying out Oculus Link until the official Oculus Link Cable becomes available.
This USB-C to USB-C cable supports 20 Gbps transfer speeds, 5A/20V power, USB 3.1, and USB 3.2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snapchat working on 'deepfake' feature which is not as sinister as it sounds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat is working on a ‘deepfake’ feature which will let users add their face to videos.
The new tool is called Cameo and will allow people to replace faces in clips with their own beautiful visage.
A deepfake video uses artificial intelligence to map the likeness of one person onto another.
It’s feared that the technology will be used to destabilise society because it allows the creation of highly convincing fake news.
But there are good reasons not to fear the arrival of Cameo.
It’s being tested in France right now and is likely to be rolled out across the world in the coming weeks or months.
In a statement, Snapchat said: ‘Cameos aren’t ready to take the stage yet, but stay tuned for their global debut soon.’
Deepfake is a portmanteau combining the words ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’, referring to simulated videos of human beings.
Its power has been vividly showcased in footage which shows the
The tech uses machine learning or artificial intelligence to combine digital images with audio files to make convincing-looking fake footage of people uttering words they’ve actually said.
We’ve already it used to bring the Mona Lisa spring to life, whilst pornographers are already creating deepfake sex videos which make it look like mainstream stars are getting involved in the action.
Politics is likely to be profoundly affected by the technology, which was demonstrated recently in a video which appeared to show Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other. 
It’s easy to see how it could be used to make effective propaganda or sew distrust among citizens, who may become unable to work out if a video is fake or genuine.
Snapchat’s own deepfake offering is not as sinister at it sounds for one simple reason: it’s not all that convincing yet.
It will superimpose your face onto a video, sure, but the resulting creation is not particularly realistic.
This means the feature is more suitable for comedy or the creation of bespoke reaction gifs than, you know, subverting democracy.
Snapchat has created 150 looping video gifs for Cameo. You’ll be able to cut out an image of a face and then add it to an actor’s own features in one of these clips.
You’ll also be able to easily send Cameos in chats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Minecraft Bedrock Edition out this week with PS4 crossplay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like Sony has finally given in when it comes to crossplay on Minecraft, with a new Bedrock Edition coming to PS4 this week.
Sony has never been keen on cross-play – the ability to play the same game with other people even if they’re using different consoles. As far as they’re concerned everyone should be playing on the PlayStation 4 and they don’t want to even acknowledge the existence of rivals.
But their position has slowly mellowed over time, with games such as Fortnite and Rocket League allowing for crossplay and now, apparently, Minecraft as well.
Of course, the problem with Minecraft is that it’s owned by Microsoft, but leaked images of a new retail edition called Minecraft Bedrock Edition suggest Sony has finally relented.
Sony hasn’t announced anything yet, so this could be the world’s most elaborate and pointless hoax (and god knows we’ve had a few of those), but with a new State of Play livestream due tomorrow it seems very likely it’ll be announced then.
Multiple fans online have posted pictures of the box, which is supposedly in stores now, ready to be put up on shelves, and it clearly describes what’s needed for crossplay to work (basically a Microsoft account).
There was also a listing on Best Buy for a short time, before it was taken down, in what has been an all-round terrible attempt to keep the secret.
But assuming all this is true then from this week you’ll be able to play Minecraft together with friends no matter whether they’re playing on an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or Android device.
State of Play is Sony’s equivalent to a Nintendo Direct and has frequently been used to announce new games and services.
The next one is due to take place on Tuesday, 10 December and it’s now widely expected to feature the first public unveiling of the Resident Evil 3 remake, since it’s been confirmed it won’t be at The Game Awards on Friday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp ending support for millions of phones later this month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WhatsApp has announced it will soon stop working on millions of phones around the world as they reach the end of their supported lifespan.
That means users on a variety of older handsets could end up losing access to the messaging app.
Facebook-owned WhatsApp has confirmed via its support page that it will stop supporting these devices on December 31, 2019.
The company says that any phone running the Windows Mobile operating system will not be supported after this date. However, that’s not all.
Any iPhone running software older than iOS 7 will no longer be supported and neither will any Android device with version 2.3.7 installed. The iOS and Android blocks won’t happen this month but will take place on February 1, 2020.
The last iPhones released running iOS 7 were the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C back in 2013. It was superseded by iOS 8 in 2014 so if you bought an iPhone (or iPad) after that date you’re going to be fine.
Similarly, Android 2.3.7 was known as ‘Gingerbread’ and was launched way back in 2010. By the February of 2011 it had been supplanted by Android 3.0, also known as Honeycomb. Chances are, unless you’re still rocking a Google Nexus S or a Samsung Galaxy S, you’ll probably be fine.
Windows Mobile is even older – it was originally rolled out in 2003 and ran until 2010 on devices like the Motorola MPx200. When it became clear that iOS and Android were more superior, Microsoft re-engineered its mobile operating system into the tile-based Windows Phone OS – which didn’t fare much better.
WhatsApp says that anyone using these older phones can no longer create new accounts or reverify existing accounts.
‘Because we no longer actively develop for these operating systems, some features might stop functioning at any time,’ the company said in a blog post announcing the cut-off dates.
WhatsApp regularly stops support for older devices, forcing users to keep up to date if they want to continue using the app.
Here are all the dates that WhatsApp stopped working on older phone systems.
‘As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use,’ WhatsApp said to justify why it routinely strips support for older operating systems.
‘While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don’t offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app’s features in the future. This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.
‘If you use one of these affected mobile devices, we recommend upgrading to a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone to continue using WhatsApp.’
As well as ditching older systems, WhatsApp is focused on adding new features for current systems. It is currently working on a dark mode which should help reduce its battery usage a bit, but it’s not available for general release.
Now the app detectives at WABetaInfo have found a clever new feature which should allow dark mode to bring even more light to your life.
It is rooted through beta mode to find a new option buried in the settings. This will let you choose between the light and dark side of WhatsApp, but also tick a box marked ‘battery saver’. This automatically switches on dark mode when your juice is running low.
‘WhatsApp doesn’t stop amazing us, continuing to improve with new features like the Battery Saver option’ the blog wrote.
The feature was found in a beta version of the software for Android. It will eventually be released to the public and run on every device, but it’s not clear when this will take place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PS6 due in 2026 says Sony, PS5 Pro in three to four years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Get your pre-orders ready because the PS6 could be out as early as 2026, with a PS5 Pro model perhaps as early as 2023.
By this time next year the PlayStation 5 should be out, but despite some rumours to the contrary there’ll only be one model, with Sony saying it has no plans for a PS5 Pro until a few years later.
That is how things worked this generation, although since the Pro version (and the Xbox One X) were a new idea at that point there was some speculation that maybe they’d be available from the start.
Masayasu Ito, Sony’s Executive VP of Hardware Engineering, has implied that won’t happened but has said that the PlayStation 5 will have an effective lifespan of six to seven years, with a Pro version coming out somewhere in the middle.
‘In the past, the cycle for a new platform was 7 to 10 years, but in view of the very rapid development and evolution of technology, it’s really a six to seven year platform cycle’, he told Game Informer.
‘Then we cannot fully catch up with the rapid development of the technology, therefore our thinking is that as far as a platform is concerned for the PS5, it’s a cycle of maybe six to seven years. But doing that, a platform lifecycle, we should be able to change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancements in technology. That was the thinking behind it, and the test case of that thinking was the PS4 Pro that launched in the midway of the PS4 launch cycle.’
As you can see he only implies the existence of the PS5 Pro but by his own logic one would be necessary in order to keep the PlayStation 5 up-to-date with new technology.
That immediately led LetsGoDigital to create a 3D mock-up, as they do for all new Sony patents and rumours, although at this point there’s no indication of what it could possibly look like (although we’re going to take a mad guess and say it’ll be a big black box).
Perhaps the most interesting comment is simply that Ito is talking about PlayStation 6 at all, even if it’s very vaguely.
With the rise of streaming there has to be a serious question as to whether the next generation of consoles will be the last one, but from what he’s saying that’s not how Sony are thinking about things at all. At least not for now anyway.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Minecraft on PS4 is finally getting cross-platform play</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Beginning on Dec. 10, the PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft will allow for cross-platform play. That means players across every major gaming platform — Nintendo Switch, Windows, Xbox One, iOS and Android, as well as Gear VR devices — will now be able to play together in the same online world.
After generations of exclusivity, default cross-platform play in modern video games is a relatively new concept. It began in earnest in late 2018 when Epic Games’ Fortnitehelped convince the major console manufacturers to play nice. Throughout 2019, more and more titles have piled on, including Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Now Minecraft joins the fray, but there’s a twist.
“PS4 players will now have their purchases and progress carry across platforms,” wrote Mojang’s Kelsey Howard in today’s press release. That means worlds, skins, min-games, and mas up packs available on the Minecraft Marketplace will all be accessible across every platform.
Minecraftis the single best-selling game of all time, beating out Tetris with a reported 176 million units sold. That’s in part why Polygon named it one of the most important games of the last decade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A bug may have revealed Modern Warfare’s battle royale mode</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare may be getting a battle royale mode, which is obviously not a first. The first inklings of the mode leaked through data miners last month, but now a strange new glitch (in a game that has a few of them) appears to confirm everything those leaks suggested.
In November, data miners posted information about a series of files that they found in the PC version of Modern Warfare that referenced something called “BR.” The files contained a description for a mode called “Battle Royale,” a player count of up to 200, and even a top down view of the map the mode supposedly takes place on.
While there was no evidence for the mode outside of the files at the time of the leaks, a new bug seems to confirm suspicions. Late Sunday night, Reddit user Nateberg3 posted a video of themselves being transported high above a strange new map after attempting to load into a Spec Ops match. From their vantage point, they’re able to look around at the entire map and see many of the same places that popped up in the leaked map from the battle royale mode.
According to the earlier leak, this battle royale mode is being developed by Raven Software and will be released in early 2020 as a free to play, standalone mode. So far, there has been no official word from Activision on whether or not Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is actually getting a battle royale mode or not.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon is one-upping its own Black Friday deal, throwing in a $30 Amazon credit with the purchase of a Nintendo Switch console. The retailer ran a similar offer on Black Friday, throwing in a $25 credit with the Nintendo Switch Lite. Turns out good things do come to those who wait; In this case, the good thing is some extra money to spend at Amazon.
Nintendo is notoriously stingy when it comes to deals, which is why many retailers offer their own bundles or, in this case, store credit in lieu of official discounts. While Nintendo’s official Black Friday deal for 2019 was an outdated Mario Kart 8 bundle, both Amazon and GameStop offered a $25 gift card with the Nintendo Switch Lite. And for Cyber Monday, Nintendo threw in a 128 GB microSD card with the updated Nintendo Switch model. So, given that microSD cards of that size are currently going for around $20, this deal is better by about $10.
In order to redeem Amazon’s offer, make sure you’re adding the HAC-001(-01) model, detailed here, to your cart (with either Red/Blue or Gray Joy-Cons.) Then enter the code D3E2CDJ6GB6S at checkout. (That code is listed on the Amazon page as well.) You’ll get an email from Amazon within 35 days with confirmation that the $30 credit has been added to your account.

We have been listening to your feedback and are excited to share the improvements we’ve made.
We designed Collections based on what you do on the web. If you’re a shopper, it will help you collect and compare items. If you’re an event or trip organizer, Collections will help pull together all your trip or event information as well as ideas to make your event or trip a success. If you’re a teacher or student, it will help you organize your web research and create your lesson plans or reports. Whatever you are doing on the web, Collections can help.
We’ve been working hard to add more functionality and refine the feature over the last couple months – some of which were directly informed by your feedback.
Here are some of the improvements we made, based on your input:
Access your collections across your devices: We’ve added sync to Collections. We know some of you have seen issues around sync, your feedback has been helping us improve. We know this is an important scenario and are ready for you to try it. When you are signed into Microsoft Edge preview builds with the same profile on different computers, Collections will sync between them.
Open all links in a collection into a new window: We’ve heard you’d like an easy way to open all sites saved in a collection. Try out “Open all” from the “Sharing and more” menu to open tabs in a new window, or from the context menu on a collection to open them as tabs in the current window so you can easily pick up where you left off. We’ve also heard that you want an easy way to save a group of tabs to a collection. This is something that we are actively working on and are excited to share when it is ready.
Edit card titles: You’ve been asking for the ability to rename the titles of items in collections, so they are easier for you to understand. Now you can. To edit a title, right click and choose “Edit” from the context menu. A dialog will appear giving you the ability to rename the title.
Dark theme in Collections: We know you love dark theme, and we want to make sure we provide a great experience in Collections. We’ve heard some feedback on notes which we’ve addressed. Try it out and let us know what you think.
 “Try Collections” flyout: We understand that if you’re an active user of Collections that we were showing you the “Try Collections” flyout even though you previously used the feature. We’ve now tuned the flyout to be quieter.
Sharing a collection: You’ve told us that once you’ve collected content you want to share it with others. We have lots of work planned to better support sharing scenarios. One way you can share today is through the “Copy all” option added to the “Sharing and more” menu, or by selecting individual items and copying them via the “Copy” button in the toolbar.
Once you’ve copied items from your Collection, you can then paste them into your favorite apps, like OneNote or Email. If you are pasting into an app that supports HTML you will get a rich copy of the content.
You can get started by opening the Collections pane from the button next to the address bar.
When you open the Collections pane, select Start new collection and give it a name. As you browse, you can start to add content related to your collection.
Now that we’re on by default, we hope that more of you will give us a try. Thank you again to all of you that have been using the feature and sending us feedback. If you think something’s not working right, or if there’s some capability you’d like to see added, please send us feedback using the smiley face icon in the top right corner of the browser.
Thanks for continuing to be a part of this preview!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Store empowers students with free Computer Science Education Week workshops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One hundred and thirteen years ago in New York, a girl was born into a generation where the average woman was more likely to perfect a signature pie recipe than solve a pi-based equation. Pushing against expectations, this girl became one of the pre-eminent technologists of our times and made it possible to convert human language into machine code understood by computers. On Dec. 9, the anniversary of Admiral Grace Hopper’s birthday kicks off Computer Science Education Week, an annual program dedicated to inspiring K-12 students to take interest in computer science.
As technology such as AI and cloud computing rapidly transforms the future of work, it’s more important than ever for students and educators to develop STEM—science, technology, engineering and math—skills. It’s estimated that over 85 million jobs worldwide will go unfilled by 2030 if we don’t bridge the STEM skills gap—but schools often struggle to implement quality STEM curriculum and prepare students for career paths that are just starting to come into focus.
Inspire students to ignite a passion for Computer Science
Microsoft Stores are committed to empowering students and educators with computer science resources and will host over 400 events in partnership with STEM influencers throughout Computer Science Education Week across locations. Ensuring no one is left behind when it comes to developing increasingly crucial computer science skills, programming this year has an increased focus on inclusion for traditionally underrepresented students.
Microsoft Store workshops will offer hands-on learning centered around coding, game design, app development and more using technologies from Windows, Surface, Office 365, Minecraft and more. Participants will hear from a diverse group of mentors and organizations from across the STEM field, including Lynell Caldwell, NASA, Brandon Copeland, Black Girls Code, Al Smith, Curtis Baham, Lee Woodall, Dennis Brown and Titus O’Neil.
Check your local Microsoft Store to register for exciting workshops geared toward empowering every learner, including workshops like;
In addition to these workshops, Microsoft Stores will also host Minecraft Hour of Code workshops, teaching students of all ages to code with Minecraft. The new Minecraft Hour of Code lesson aligns with this year’s theme, Computer Science for Good. Students will explore coding and artificial intelligence as they protect a village from forest fires in an immersive Minecraft world. Anyone can learn how coding can help build a better world—in just one hour!
Check availability of workshops and RSVP at your local Microsoft Store. Programming will vary by location. And, do you know students always get 10% off at Microsoft Store?* Make sure to take advantage of your discount when you shop at Microsoft Store.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google's AMP for Email lets email recipients browse and interact with content without having to click a link and redirect to another webpage outside of the email.
Adobe announced on Monday that customers using its Campaign email marketing platform can now include dynamic email components via Google's AMP for Email. Adobe said adding Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) support to Campaign will help make email campaigns more interactive and engaging.
Despite its shortcomings as a business and productivity tool, email is still the preferred point of contact between consumers and brands. According to Adobe's annual Consumer Email Survey, 60% of consumers prefer to receive brand offers via email, but only a quarter of the emails they receive are deemed interesting enough to open."Americans spend more than five hours a day checking their emails," Adobe wrote in a blog post. "With consumers spending so much time in their inbox, email has become an essential channel for brands to engage with their customers."AMP for Email is meant to reshape email functionality and help brands better engage with their audiences. With AMP, recipients can respond to an email interactively without having to click a link and redirect to another webpage outside of the email.Further, AMP lets marketers embed real-time info such flight status, events, news, and purchases inside emails, while allowing recipients to do things like confirm their attendance at an event and fill out questionnaires. 
Google launched its open-source framework AMP in February 2016 to enable developers build a faster mobile browsing experience for customers. Based on a diverse architecture using Javascript, HTML and open source technologies, AMP is designed to serve up mobile-optimized content (and ads) with minimal data requirements on mobile networks.For marketers, the AMP for Email effort could create more interesting pitches and outreach programs with customers, better service, and collaboration use cases. Some of these email experiences include RSVPs, questionnaires, catalogs, and hooks into Google Docs. On the customer service front, AMP for Email lets email recipients respond to comments and community boards directly. 
AMP support is available to Adobe Campaign customers now.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft rolls out Campaign Views in public preview for Office 365 ATP customers.
Microsoft is launching today a new security feature in public preview.Named "Campaign Views," this is a new feature that will be available for Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) -- which is the company's paid email filtering service, available as an add-on for Office 365, its multi-functional cloud-based office suite.Campaign Views will be a new section in the Office 365 ATP Threat Explorer dashboard where customers can get a full view of an entire malicious email phishing campaign that's hitting a company's email inboxes.Until today, Office 365 ATP users could only see details about each of the individual malicious emails that reached users. Campaign Views will show details about the entire phishing campaign and all the tricks and infrastructure it uses.The goal is to give security teams an idea of what other tricks the same attacker might be using, so they can put filters and security protections in place.
Microsoft says security teams will be able to view:
To power this new feature, Microsoft will be using its global view over the entire Office 365 infrastructure, but also "machine learning, advanced heuristics, rich detonation capabilities, targeted capabilities to spot business email compromise, and massive security intelligence sources that come together during mail-flow as well as after email delivery."
Per Microsoft, during its public preview stage, Campaign Views will be available for customers with any of the following plans:➢ Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2➢ Office 365 E5➢ Microsoft 365 E5 Security➢ Microsoft 365 E5"The Campaign Views have started rolling out into public preview, so you'll see it in your tenant over the next few days and weeks," Microsoft said.Microsoft said feedback from customers who helped test the feature has been "extremely positive."An official documentation page for the new Campaign Views feature will also go live later today on this Microsoft Docs page.Campaign Views will be added to an already impressive list of Office 365 ATP protections.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The rumored new iPhone SE 2 is rumored to enjoy the name iPhone 9. What could be more perfect?
×
There's been a large hole in my life for the last couple of years.No, it's not the lack of a MacBook keyboard that works. That hole's existed for just over a year. This particularly large, two-year hole has been getting bigger every day as it gnaws at my jaws. It began when Apple launched iPhone X. At the time, data scientists and other numerical experts observed that Apple had skipped a beat. Or rather had skipped iPhone 9.Rationalist logicians insisted this was because it was the iPhone's 10th anniversary, so Apple wanted to celebrate that. I couldn't help thinking it was just as likely because Samsung had already released its Galaxy S9, so an iPhone 9 wouldn't sound so exciting. And, well, it had an exciting new notch, so it needed an exciting new name.
I still mourned the loss of the 9. It was symbolically awkward that the iPhone had lost its ninth life.Now, however, a rumor has emerged that the iPhone 9 might rise from the dead. Japanese site MacOtakara is suggesting that the rumored new iPhone SE 2, which may or may not emerge in March, will actually be called iPhone 9. This new phone will allegedly have a 4.7-inch screen, and, goodness, a home button.
It'll surely be for those with slightly smaller hands and tiny suspicions about Face ID. It'll also be a charming trip to the past -- something shiny, but reassuring. Like Michael Bublé. Some say MacOtakara has purveyed reliable rumors in the past. I wouldn't dream, however, of venturing the actual possibility of this gap in my life being filled.I hope, however, it is. Not merely for the satisfaction of a sequence restored, but for the adorable prospect of Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, attempting to give a deeply nuanced explanation for the name.After all, he's already admitted that the XR in iPhone XR means negative squat. What tale could he concoct to justify the belated appearance of the iPhone 9? Will he claim nine is Tim Cook's favorite number? Will he insist this was always Apple's devious plan? Oh, I know. He'll say it's a spontaneous homage to Apple's neighbors, the San Francisco 49ers after they actually reach the Super Bowl again. (Disclosure: No, not a Niners fan.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">How the demise of the headphone jack led to a ear buds boom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ear buds, or hearables, are driving a boom in wearable devices, according to IDC data. It all started as vendors started dropping the headphone jack en masse.
The returns to technology vendors for ditching the headphone jack are becoming increasingly clear. IDC reported that global shipments of wearable devices including ear-worn buds hit 84.5 million units in the third quarter, up 94.6% from a year ago.IDC said wearable market share gains were driven by hearables, also know as ear buds. IDC analyst Ramon Llamas noted that the hearables boom "began with multiple vendors removing the headphone jack from their smartphones, driving the move toward wireless headphones."And now ear buds are getting new functionality and form factors to further drive sales and there's a mass market to be had. The wearable market is dominated by earwear, a market that is enjoying a boom partly due to the end of the headphone jack on smartphones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's new monster $6,000 Mac Pro is about to ship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple says it about to start selling the new Mac Pro, as well as the $5,000 Pro Display XDR and its $999 stand.
Apple quietly informed some fans that it will start shipping the Mac Pro and its eye-wateringly expensive Pro Display XDR and stand from December 10, as spotted by a customer who received the company's "save the date" email on Saturday.  
The new devices were showcased last June at the Worldwide Developers Conference in an effort to woo creative professionals. Apple had announced that the Mac Pro and the Pro Display XDR would start shipping this fall.The updated Pro hardware made waves at the time for being "an absolute monster of a workstation", with the entry-level Mac Pro including an octa-core Intel Xeon CPU and supporting 32GB of memory. Since then, Apple has also specified that the device can be ordered with an additional 8TB drive. SEE: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)But it was the Pro Display XDR that stole the show. Its 32-inch display and 6K resolution, along with P3 and 10-bit color built-in as well as automatic color adjustment, are likely to seduce graphic designers, photographers and other creative professionals using workstations. 
The XDR Display has to be purchased with a separate stand, which uses a Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect to the Mac Pro and can support up to six displays. The workstation is particularly suited to video editors and photographers who work with HDR images and footage.While the revamped Mac Pro – which is the first major upgrade of the device since 2013 – promises better performance, it was the new products' price that was the talk of the town. 
The Mac Pro comes at $5,999, while the XDR Display is priced at $4,999 and its stand, at $999. The catch? The Mac Pro doesn't come with a display, and the display doesn't come with a stand.Altogether, users will be looking at a $12,000 budget to use Apple's new workstation.  So Apple is banking on the promise of highly sophisticated technology to win back customers who historically may have preferred the Cupertino giant's hardware but have increasingly spent their money with competitors.Microsoft, for instance, is gradually attracting users away from Apple with the Surface range. The Surface Studio 2 compares well to the iMac Pro, boasting a Core i7 processor, a high-end GPU, and a high-definition display with 3:2 aspect ratio. SEE: 30 things you should never do in Microsoft Office (free PDF)But the Surface Studio 2 starts at $3,499. Microsoft's prices are already cheaper than the iMac Pro, which ships at $4,999.Apple is hoping to compete with ever-more sophisticated products, or so it seems, but we shouldn't expect them to be affordable anytime soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Windows 10 Mobile is over: Prepare for final security patches as support ends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No more Windows 10 Mobile security updates after December 2019's Patch Tuesday.
Tuesday marks the end of Microsoft's failed bid to get the world on Windows Mobile, Windows Phone or Windows 10 Phone. Come December 2019 Patch Tuesday, it will be the last time Microsoft ever offers security updates for devices running Windows 10 Mobile. 
The end of Windows 10 Mobile patches is not a huge deal in itself. After all, even Microsoft execs and Microsoft's co-founder, Bill Gates, have moved on to using mostly Samsung Android phones.     But the day is a marker for what Gates has described as his biggest mistake as CEO of one of the world's biggest software companies. Last month he opined that the world would be on Windows Mobile if he had not been distracted by his self-made antitrust problems in the US and Europe.    "There's no doubt that the antitrust lawsuit was bad for Microsoft, and we would have been more focused on creating the phone operating system. And so instead of using Android today, you would be using Windows Mobile," Gates said, explaining Microsoft was just three months late delivering Windows Mobile to Motorola, just as Motorola launched the Moto Droid in 2009.SEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF)
Microsoft's lifecycle FAQ page doesn't capture the drama smartphones caused to Microsoft. Instead it dryly states: "Windows 10 Mobile, version 1709 (released October 2017) is the last release of Windows 10 Mobile and Microsoft will end support on December 10, 2019. The end of support date applies to all Windows 10 Mobile products, including Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise." Microsoft has conducted an orderly and firm withdrawal of Windows Phone support ever since its current CEO, Satya Nadella, wrote off the $7bn-plus Nokia devices acquisition carried out under former CEO Steve Ballmer. 
Last month it announced it would shut down the Windows Phone 8.1 app store on December 16, leaving users with an option to download apps ahead of that date. Some Lumia users could update to Windows 10 Mobile, but come the January 2020 Patch Tuesday date, there will be no more security updates. Of course, Microsoft is gearing up for the release of its new dual-screen Surface mobile devices, which consist of the Android Surface Duo and the Windows 10X Surface Neo. Microsoft in November began inviting interested developers to its preview program so it could "share how developers can unlock this new era of mobile creativity" without having to change too much code in existing apps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fortnite on Google Play: Is a 30% cut worth the security benefits?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Opinion: Google says there are no exceptions. Should Epic Games bite the bullet?
After Fortnite launched on the Android mobile operating system, users were made aware that the installation process was somewhat unusual.
Rather than visiting the Google Play Store and downloading the software directly, Epic Games employed a different installation technique known as sideloading, which requires the app to be downloaded from another source; in this case, Epic Games' website. Adding additional purchase or installation barriers to consumers in a market where easily-accessible and streamlined processes have become a priority is generally frowned upon and is not considered best business practice. In this case, however, the Fortnite developer wanted to avoid Google's requirements when it comes to in-app billing.  As of this year, Epic Games says there are roughly 250 million active Fortnite players, and when you combine this with the app's virtual currency V-Bucks -- used to purchase everything from outfits to weapons in-game -- you can see the potential profit margins.  Market tracker Edison Trends estimates that Fornite in-app revenues dropped by 52 percent between Q2 2018 and Q2 2019, but the game is still a cash cow that outstrips everything else on the market with billions of dollars already banked. 
Currently, developers must adhere to terms of service which include the implementation of Google Play In-app Billing to make in-app purchases, rather than their own payment methods. So when you consider a commission rate of roughly 30 percent levied on in-app purchases made by apps hosted on Google Play, you can see why the developer may wish to protect this revenue stream.  A 9to5 Google report emerged over the past week which suggested Epic Games had submitted Fortnite to Google Play in the hopes of a special exception to the 30 percent rule. 
Google said no. See also: Fortnite is being used by criminals to launder cash through V-BucksIn a statement, the tech giant told the publication:
This is no surprise in itself as if Google made one exception -- especially to a massively popular app -- more developers would come knocking at the door asking for special treatment.  Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has previously described Google and Apple's 'tax' as "a high cost in a world where game developers' 70 percent must cover all the cost of developing, operating, and supporting their games." Sweeney also cited "economic efficiency" as a reason for maintaining sideloading rather than pay the commission, but the decision has been met with criticism by the security community.  CNET: IoT devices need built-in security standards, UL saysGoogle Play is not an untouchable gold standard in security as, on occasion, malicious apps do circumvent existing security controls and become hosted in the official Android app repository.  However, it is generally considered wise to download apps from sources such as Google Play and the Apple App Store as these companies are constantly improving their security measures and there is less of a chance that the software you are downloading is malicious as external researchers, too, are monitoring the stores.  Downloading an app from a third-party website requires high levels of trust in these sources as they are not checked for malware, and they also require users to enable the "allow unknown apps to be installed" setting to be enabled on handsets.  It is this avenue that can be exploited by attackers to perform phishing, Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks and to download malicious payloads on to devices. TechRepublic: Analysts worry about tech security threats ahead of 2020 electionsShortly after the launch of the Android version of Fortnite, Google disclosed a vulnerability in the Fortnite installer APK which could be exploited to allow attackers to hijack the app through a Man-in-The-Disk (MiTD) attack, leading to the substitution of packages for malicious code, high privileges and permission levels to be granted, and device hijacking. At the time, Sweeney branded the disclosure, made a week after a patch had been developed, as a way to "score cheap PR points." Check Point, too, found a bug in Fortnite's infrastructure which gave attackers access to user accounts with very little effort. Over nine million Fortnite accounts were reportedly hacked last year. It does not, and should not, just come down to money. We've seen in the past that it can take no more than one overlooked security issue to bring a company's reputation crashing down, landing them a hefty bill to repair the damage and for compensation, and while a 30 percent rate may be high, users do benefit from an improved app security posture.  As Fortnite does handle payment data, the need to maintain adequate security is even more important considering its massive customer base. The company has launched schemes to try and boost app security, including rewards for users that enable two-factor authentication (2FA). However, given that the app does tend to have a younger audience that may be more susceptible to phishing, downloading installers from untrusted sources, and giving away the keys to their accounts unwittingly, choosing to stay with sideloading could end up costing the company -- and its customers -- far more in the long run than Google's commission.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bridges in major cities are crumbling and in desperate need of inspection. Technology convergence offers a light at the end of a rickety tunnel.
Infrastructure is literally crumbling in many major cities. Fortunately, a number of new technologies are converging to assist in overdue inspections of vital infrastructure such as road and railway bridges."Typically, municipalities or private companies send out a large team of inspectors and need to close certain sections of the bridges to traffic," says Michael Diener, engineering manager at StrucInspect, a company focusing on improving on that method with technology. "And some areas are hard or impossible for a human inspector to reach, creating the risk that a defect might go unnoticed."Drones and 3D cameras can help. Vienna-based StrucInspect overcomes these challenges with an innovative service based on 3D modeling and artificial intelligence. The company captures thousands of images from drones and terrestrial cameras to create a precise 3D replica of the structure's exterior and interior—including hard-to-reach places. Then customers receive a full report, including a textured, 3D mesh model that they can turn and zoom with ½-millimeter precision. With over 65,000 bridges in Austria and Germany alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally, the market for a product suite like that is potentially massive. But the solution comes with some major challenges. Chief among them, the sheer computing power it takes to process all that data.Building textured 3D mesh models from thousands of high-res images requires powerful processors and graphics processing units (GPUs). So does editing the models, which contain hundreds of gigabytes, to remove extraneous details like piles of leaves or snowdrifts. 
StrucInspect's solution is a tale of cloud success. "To work in the cloud we needed a 'native' workstation experience—no lag or latency," says Diener. StrucInspect found its solution in Teradici Cloud Access Software on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). StrucInspect chose GCP because of its AI platform, Python compatibility, and NVIDIA GPU options, including the Tesla P100. 
Before discovering the Teradici solution the company had tried open-source Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for a few months. But VNC is not designed for visualization or to support USB devices like mouses. The company's photographic measurement specialists were frustrated by seconds of lag whenever they tried to open, manipulate, or edit a model. In contrast, Teradici Cloud Access Software, powered by the PCoIP protocol, is highly responsive even for full frame-rate 3D graphics."Using Teradici Cloud Access Software with GCP and NVIDIA GPUs is literally like working on a local workstation," Diener says. "Files open immediately—not several seconds later as they did with VNC—saving up to 30 minutes on a typical 8-hour project. We can turn the 3D models left, right, and upside down and peer into little crevasses with the same experience we'd have on a local workstation." Security is also a big concern, particularly when dealing with issues of vulnerability related to infrastructure. No information ever leaves the cloud because only encrypted pixels travel over the network to the laptop display, where they're decoded. And StrucInspect now has the flexibility to switch from Linux to Windows remote workstations as needed because Cloud Access Software supports both operating systems. Diener concludes, "For our business, Teradici Cloud Access Software on GCP is increasing efficiency, productivity, and work satisfaction. Our users couldn't believe they could work in the cloud with a native experience. It's a world of difference."For the rest of us, we can breathe a little easier knowing bridge inspections are happening faster and more comprehensively than ever before.

    <h5 class="mb-1">LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen, long-term test: Two screens good, but beware bulk and battery life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen is an interesting and affordable alternative to a folding-screen handset, but it does have some significant drawbacks.
While companies such as Samsung work on their folding-screen handsets, LG has taken a different approach. The LG V50 ThinQ, which is available in the UK on EE 5G, offers two entirely separate screens, and a second handset with a similar design -- the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen -- got a full review from my US colleague Matthew Miller back in October ("an affordable two-screen device that is better for productivity than the Fold"). I've been using the LG G8X for several weeks, and have some longer-term thoughts to add into the mix. The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen isn't available in the UK through official channels at the time of writing, so there's no UK price to quote here. When that changes, we'll update this article. In the US, the handset costs $699.99 (down from a launch price of $949.99), which is positively affordable compared to Samsung's $1,980 Galaxy Fold. As with the V50 ThinQ, the second screen attaches to a standalone handset via a case cover. This makes for a big, chunky phone to carry around. The handset on its own measures 159mm by 75.6mm by 8mm and weighs 192g. The Dual Screen hinged case has the second screen on its inside. The case measures 165mm by 84mm by 14mm thick and weighs 139g. The handset slips inside a frame that holds it securely in place, bringing the two-screen device weight to a hefty 331g. SEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF)I go into this detail because whatever the second screen has to offer, you have to consider the size and weight factor. I found the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen too large for most of my pockets, so it had to sit in a bag much of the time, making basic tasks like taking a call or checking an appointment much more of a hassle than usual. On the other hand, I didn't want to leave the second screen at home -- if you've got it, what's the point of not having it with you? An IP68 rating for dust/water resistance and MIL-STD 810G compliance provide reassurance that this is a sturdy device.
The screen cover has a huge cutout on the back for the cameras, while buttons on the outer hinge for volume and power map onto the handset's buttons. These work fine.
The bottom of the case has cutouts for the 3.5mm headset jack and speaker grille. My favourite wired headset fitted fine and felt secure. The handset charges via USB-C, but rather than provide a large cutout for cable to access the port, LG has come up with a separate, small, magnetic charge dongle. I found this arrangement irritating. First, I had to remember to carry the dongle around. Second, leaving it permanently fitted to a charge cable is not convenient: if, like me, you use one cable to charge multiple pieces of kit, that little dongle will need to be kept safe and not get lost. Good luck with that. 
The charge dongle is held in place with magnets, which I found to be far from ideal. There were several occasions during testing when I thought I'd left the phone charging only to come back a few hours later to find the dongle and handset had parted company as things had been moved around my desk or I hadn't ensured a firm connection in the first place. Thankfully, wireless charging is also available.The practicalities of charging will matter if you want to make full use of the second screen because it's a real battery drain. With just the main screen in play you'll get pretty good life from the 4,000mAh battery: over a four-hour period the LG G8X ThinQ lost just 19% of its charge when running a YouTube video continuously in full screen. It's a different story when it comes to the dual-screen configuration: with the main screen on but doing nothing and the same video looping full-screen in the second screen, the battery lost 67% of its charge in four hours. This phone actually has three displays. The reverse side of the second screen has a smallish display of white text on a black background that gives the time, date and some notifications. It's just for information -- not for interaction -- but is quite useful. Still, it's how the phone and second screen work together that will make or break this handset's popularity. The hinge on the second screen cover rotates through a full 360 degrees, so that the screens can be set back to back. I couldn't think of a single situation in which I wanted to use this: most often. the screens were either flat on a desk or with one raised up in laptop mode. As a writer, I found the ability to have a word-working app in one screen and keyboard in the other only marginally useful. In laptop mode there's little speed or comfort gain over the usual handset keyboard, while in portrait mode the screen splits with half the keyboard on the left, and half on the right. Some people might be OK with this, but I just found it awkward. Overall, I'm not convinced of any real productivity gains over using conventional typing techniques on a phone.
You can spread content across both screens in portrait and landscape modes. In portrait mode the huge 'spine' down the centre of the screen gets in the way, but it works a bit better in landscape mode. Still, it's not a patch on simply having a larger screen in the first place. The gaming mode with a virtual gaming controller on the main handset screen and the game itself on the second screen is better -- but remember that battery life issue (gamers will need ready access to mains power). I used the second screen as a viewfinder to take photos occasionally, but most useful of all was running two separate apps full screen -- reading an ebook on one while doing a myriad of everyday things on the other, for example, or comparing two web pages. Using the second screen is remarkably easy thanks to a mini sidebar menu that you can pull out with a quick tap on the right edge of the main screen. Once this is visible it's easy to swap content between the left and right screens, switch in and out of dual-screen mode and, if you're viewing content at the time, to use 'wide view' across both screens as just described. The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen has a flagship-level specification. Both screens are 6.4-inch OLED displays with 2,340 -by-1,080 resolution and in-screen fingerprint recognition on the main screen. The Snapdragon 855 chipset with 6GB of RAM powered the handset to impressive three-pass average Geekbench 5 scores of 2702 (multi core) and 744 (single core) -- see the Geekbench browser for comparative Android handset results. There is 128GB of internal storage, of which 103GB is free for use. This can be boosted with a MicroSD card, which will sit in a caddy next to the single SIM. A 32MP front camera is fine for selfies, while at the back there are two cameras: a 12MP sensor with an f/1.8 lens and OIS and a 13MP sensor with an f/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens. It's not the triple- or quad-camera setup that so many handset-makers offer these days, but it's good enough for general-purpose photography. Android 9 is, inevitably, augmented with various tweaks -- notably, for controlling the second screen -- but there's no intrusive overlay here. It's been interesting using the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen for a long-term evaluation. The second screen has proven useful for using two apps at once, but not for working with text, while gaming is a positive experience but a real battery drain. The battery suffers generally when both screens are in use, and the miniature USB-C dongle makes charging more troublesome than it should be. The phone is also large, heavy and too big for my pockets.  The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen is certainly an interesting and affordable alternative to a folding-screen handset, but it does have some significant drawbacks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google is also rolling out an update to its memory management to ‘proactively compress’ background apps.
Google has started running “feature drops” for its Pixel smartphones as part of a new way to regularly provide users with the latest features.
The tech giant is rolling out the first package from Monday, which includes greater photo editing controls, allowing handset owners to blur the background of images, even if they were taken sometime ago.
As part of the update, Google said Pixel 4 devices in the UK and Ireland will be “soon” receive a new faster and more helpful voice-powered Google Assistant.
The new Recorder app is due to arrive on older generations of the Pixel, while Pixel 3 and 3a handsets will be able to experience Live Caption, the company’s new AI-driven audio captioning option.
Google said it will also roll out an update to its memory management to “proactively compress” background apps in a bid to make the Pixel run more smoothly when multitasking.
Users in the US only will have an additional feature, automatic screening of robocalls to silently filter out cold calling – if it’s not spam, a description of who’s calling and why is provided, so users can decide if they wish to pick up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A real looker with an executive feel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a packed field of stylish competitors, to stand out from the crowd takes a bit of doing.
Step forward Mazda. The new Mazda3, is without doubt one of the lookers in the compact family car market.
Sleek, svelte, feline, particularly this exclusive model in pretty unimaginatively named Polymer grey livery, (I prefer gun metal grey), matched with privacy glass, dark alloy wheels.
New for this year, it offers a huge range of standard equipment across the range, as well as high-end pieces of kit normally associated with executive/luxury brands.
The front features a sloping low nose with large front grille with lowered air scoop, flanked by slim light clusters which feature LED lighting.
The rear lights are incorporated into the high boot line and rounded off with twin exhausts.
There are five trim levels: SE-L, SE-L Lux, Sport Lux, GT Sport and GT Sport Tech..
All models feature head-up display with Traffic Sign Recognition,Radar Cruise Control, plus sat nav and smartphone connectivity via Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and an impressive eight-speaker audio system.
This model also included a reversing camera, multi-function steering wheel, smart keyless entry, heated front seats and frameless rear view mirror .
The interior is the best yet with the model featuring black leather seats with powered adjustment, and heated steering wheel.
The cabin has an executive feel, with soft touch plastics throughout and although the leather and trim makes the interior dark, it is nicely offset with chrome detailing throughout.
The firm says it takes a minimalist approach with every aspect of the cockpit laid out in perfect horizontal symmetry with the driver to deliver both ergonomic simplicity. If that means comfortable, then it is.
All models feature a seven-inch colour TFT driver instrument display, and the brain of the car is the 8.8-inch central display, controlling sat nav, infotainment and connectivity via central a control dial.
It exudes comfort and luxury although leg and headroom is slightly restricted for rear passengers.
This model features a two litre 122PS petrol engine which delivers plenty of grunt. Mated to a slick-shifting six-speed gearbox, it feels like a real driver’s car with plenty of shifts for maximum performance. Refined and free revving, acceleration is brisk, if not startling, hitting 60mph in around 10 seconds.
Brisk performance is accompanied by excellent handling, sharp steering and a firm ride.
Mazda says its SkyActiv-Vehicle Architecture is intended to optimise ride, refinement and handling and it certainly feels the case as the car turns in sweetly to corners, always feeling well balanced with the driver in control.
The only slight setback is the firm ride, which can be unsettling over rougher roads. As a hatchback the car needs to be practical with good stowage and storage space.
The Mazda3 is a family car and meets its role with plenty of oddments room in the front and back together with a decent sized easy to use boot which dramatically increases capacity as the offset split rear seats are folded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McLaren reveals track-focused 620R</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">High-performance machine is limited to just 350 units
McLaren has announced a road-legal version of its GT4 race car – the 620R.
Limited to just 350 units – all of which will be hand-assembled at the firm’s factory in Woking – the 620R shares much of its componentry with McLaren’s track car.
Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 610bhp and 620Nm of torque, the 620R takes the title as the most powerful car in McLaren’s Sports Series.
It’ll crack 0 to 60mph in just 2.7seconds and hit a top speed of 200mph, sending its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed DCT gearbox. Thanks to features such an adjustable carbon fibre rear wing, the 620R can generate up to 185kg of downforce.
The 620R also benefits from the race car version’s adjustable coilover dampers, with 32 individual settings available per corner. Its cornering performance is bolstered further thanks to stiffer anti-roll bars, carbon-ceramic brakes and ultra-sticky Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tyres.
Inside, the air conditioning has been removed, while the carpets and glove box have been removed in the quest for lightness. That said, the audio system and navigation – removed as standard – can be put back in at no extra cost.
Both driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fibre bucket seats with six-point harnesses, while the shift paddles, steering wheel spokes and centre console have all been crafted from the ultra-light material.
As mentioned, the 620R is limited to just 350 units, with each one commanding a £250,000 price tag. European and American buyers get a McLaren track day, featuring expert tuition, included as part of the car’s price, too. Production is set to commence in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vivo V17 with 6.44-inch hole-punch display, quad cameras launched in India for ₹22,990 ($323)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vivo today introduced a new mid-range smartphone in India, called the V17. Unlike the V17 that was launched in Russia last month, the Indian variant comes with a tiny hole-punch display and has an L-shaped quad camera array on the back.
The new Vivo V17 sports a 6.44-inch E3 Super AMOLED display with a tall 20:9 aspect ratio and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. Powering Vivo's latest mid-range smartphone for the Indian market is an 11nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage.
Vivo V17's L-shaped quad camera array includes a 48MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor for portrait shots. Housed within the tiny hole-punch cutout on top of the phone's display is a 32MP selfie camera.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
Keeping the lights on is a 4,500mAh battery, with support for the company's 18W Dual-Engine fast charging technology. The Vivo V17 also features an optical in-display fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the software front, it runs on Android 9.0 Pie OS with Vivo's Funtouch OS 9.2 on top.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Esports startup PatronGG has announced it has secured a $1 million seed investment for its esports engagement platform, Kokyo.
The funding was led by Bitkraft Esports Ventures, supported by Trust Esport.
PatronGG is developing Kokyo as a platform to connect esports organizations and fans through social channels, news, and video content from multiple locations across the internet. It will also include monetization and subscription options for organizations to earn money from their fan communities.
"Trust Esport is proud to partner with Bitkraft Esports Ventures to support the creation and the launch of Kokyo," said Trust Esport founding partner Mattieu Dallon. "Interactions between esports clubs and their fans are essential but currently lack structure. This investment is part of our ambition to develop platforms and apps to widely spread esports content and to monetize esports audiences in a sustainable and profitable way for all players in the ecosystem, and especially the clubs."
This adds another esports investment to Bitkraft's recent string, which has included esports mobile startup Meta Games, MMO developer Playable Worlds, esports music startup Five Vectors, gaming broadcast network VENN, and accessible development platform maker Manticore Games.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The team behind The Elder Scrolls Legends has ceased development on the game.
In an announcement to the game's community via Reddit, the publisher announced that all new content developer or releases have been put "on hold for the foreseeable future."
The game's roadmap had previously suggested one more expansion pack would be released before the end of the year, but these plans have been scrapped.
However, Bethesda has assured that it will continue to support the game with regular in-game events and reward cards every month, as well as ongoing maintenance support.
It has also clarified that the development and release for the Asia-specific version, which operates separately, will not be affected and will "inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward."
It was further stressed that both versions of Legends would continue to operate after the launch of the Asian edition and will not be merged, keeping their player bases separate.
It's not clear whether the plans for the console versions of The Elder Scrolls Legends have been scrapped as well. GamesIndustry.biz has reached out to Bethesda for clarification. The publisher announced it would be bringing the game to Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch at E3 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UPDATE 9/12/19: Platinum's pair of Vanquish and Bayonetta remasters are now official. As we reported last week, both will launch on 18th February 2020 with a 10th Anniversary Bundle containing both games.
On PlayStation 4, digital versions of the game will also unlock a pair of static console themes.
Here's our first trailer:
ORIGINAL STORY 5/12/19: Microsoft has listed new remasters of Vanquish and Bayonetta on its official store for release on 18th February 2020.
"Remastered for the first time on Xbox One," each game's description reads. "4K graphics at 60FPS available for Xbox One X."
A 10th Anniversary Bundle of the two games together has also been spotted (thanks, All Games Delta).
Publisher Sega is yet to announce either remaster. We're checking now in case there's anything official yet to add.
Vanquish Xbox One screenshots.
First released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2010, Platinum's sci-fi shooter Vanquish was later launched on PC in 2017. We suspect this latter version is the one being polished up for Xbox One (and, likely, PS4). Perhaps, considering Platinum's close relationship with Nintendo, there will be a version for Switch as well?
As for Bayonetta, well it is of course already available for Switch - but not for PS4 or Xbox One. We'll update here when we have official word.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finally, PlayStation gets cross-platform Minecraft tomorrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At last, Minecraft will launch its cross-platform version on PlayStation 4 tomorrow - Tuesday, 10th December.
The game's Bedrock build is currently available and offers cross-play between (deep breath) Xbox One, Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, iPhone, Android and Gear VR.
Existing owners of Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition will "begin updating" to the Bedrock version then, Microsoft said today in a press release.
Just as when this happened on Xbox One, the Bedrock version will arrive as its own separate game client. You'll still be able to play the old PlayStation 4 Edition if you own it already, but it will no longer be available to purchase.
Disc-based versions of Minecraft: PS4 Edition will unlock a download for Minecraft's Bedrock edition.
You'll need an Xbox login to play Minecraft's Bedrock edition on PS4, Microsoft confirmed to Eurogamer. But of course you do not need to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber.
"A free Microsoft or Xbox Live account allows all Minecraft players to track progress and purchases across platforms, now including PS4," a spokesperson told Eurogamer. "The paid Xbox Live Gold service is not required to play Minecraft."
Oh, and you won't unlock Xbox achievements, the spokesperson confirmed. Instead, PlayStation owners will unlock trophies.
So, why now? Here's what Microsoft said when we asked:
"This has been a big year for Minecraft - we've been making major changes to the game and taking steps in new directions, but our original vision for connecting players across devices and having the best experience regardless of platform will always stay true.
"We've been talking to our partners at Sony about this for a while, and think now is the right time from both a studio and community perspective to bring PS4 players along on the Bedrock journey."
The arrival of Bedrock on PS4 marks the end of a long wait for PlayStation fans. Up until now, Sony's console has been the last to use Minecraft's specially-developed console version, ported by Scottish outfit 4J Studios, as opposed to the Bedrock client which has become the default Minecraft version on Switch and Xbox One. Recent additions include a character creator, and foxes and bees. Next up is a big update for the Nether.
We'll likely hear more during tomorrow's PlayStation State of Play livestream, scheduled for 2pm UK time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's a day of the week that ends with a 'Y' so you know what that means. Yep, eBay is back at it again with another voucher code. This one is pretty special, though, as you can use it to save 10 per cent off any purchase over £100 across the site.
There are no retailer restrictions as with other eBay codes (at least from what I've seen when browsing) so you can find some terrific savings at stores such as Argos, AO, Currys PC World, Ebuyer, Scan and more. All you need to do is enter the code 'PROSPER10' at the checkout and you can save up to £50 off a single purchase.
Now, we'd be here until the code expires trying to pick out absolutely everything that's best to buy using this latest voucher. Instead, I've listed a few highlights for you to peruse below. There are console bundles - including the Nintendo Switch - along with lots of other top tech savings:
Consoles:
TVs:
More tech:
If nothing there grabs you, why not take the trip over to eBay and search for whatever you'd like to make a saving on. As long as its £100 or more, the 'PROSPER10' can be applied to get 10 per cent off - up to a maximum of £50.
Remember, though, that the code expires on 10th December so you've only got today to make use of it. It's a great chance to snap up some last-minute Christmas bargains - especially if you missed out on anything you wanted during the Black Friday sales.
We'll continue to update this page for the rest of the day if we spot any other great offers hidden away. You can also give us a follow over at Jelly Deals and on Twitter for a rolling feed of all the best bargains using this latest eBay voucher!

    <h5 class="mb-1">First Humble Choice bundle launches featuring Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Blasphemous and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in October, it was announced that the Humble Monthly subscription service would be undergoing a rework to become Humble Choice. Well, the first edition of the new bundle format is live.
Now, instead of paying a regular fee upfront and getting access to a mystery bundle of games each month, Humble Choice allows you to pick from a diverse selection depending on your membership level.
Here's the full list of ten games you can choose from in the Humble Choice debut:
Premium members who pay £15.99 a month get to choose nine games from the above list to add to their collection forever. You also get access to the Humble Trove library and a chunky 20 per cent off at the Humble Store.
The Basic tier will set you back £11.99 a month and allow you to pick three games from each bundle. That also comes with Humble Trove access and 10 per cent off at the Humble Store.
There's also a £3.99 a month Lite tier, but with that you only get to dip into the Humble Trove along with 10 per cent off at the store.
What do we think of this new format, then? To me, the value seems a little off-kilter with the Basic plan as with that you now have to pay more money each month for about a third of the games you'd get before. Pick smartly, though, and you could find yourself a decent saving if you sign up on a month-by-month basis.
For example, if you get Lara's latest globetrotting relic-thieving misadventure Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the grotesque/gorgeous action-platformer Blasphemous and cold war strategy gem Phantom Doctrine in the December bundle you'll be saving around £50 compared to buying them at full price.
And at least you can't miss out on a good bundle now, too. You can simply wait and see what games are up for grabs each month before you get to make your choices, so it's all about signing up for the months you like the look of instead of paying in advance and hoping you get something good.
In any case, if you like the look of some of the games available this month you can sign up for Humble Choice right here. If you previously had a Humble Monthly membership, you'll have been automatically enrolled into the Humble Classic tier, which gets you all ten of each month's games for your old subscription price. Not bad, there!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Witness Spooky Evidence of Snapchat's New Face-Swapping Feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes social media dipsomania comes into harsh relief, as it did today when the technology wars manifested themselves as the ability to superimpose your face on a cat: aka, Snapchat’s new social drug “Cameos.” It’s terrifying.
As TechCrunch first reported, Snapchat has selectively released a beta version of a feature which allows users to scan their faces and insert them into a collection of 150 video clips hurtling toward the camera, like surfing, flinging money, hoovering up a mountain of pastries, and, per TechCrunch’s preview, a cat screaming “FEED ME.” They follow the maniacal logic that brought us pizza on a building. The eyeball injections are so addicting that they make me envision a Black Mirror scenario of the last man on earth sending a Snap of his face on a cat to himself:
You can select a friend to add to a Cameo:
TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine tweeted a demo:
Snapchat must keep rolling this shit out if it wants to get your attention, vying with new kids like TikTok and competitors that rip them off, as Apple did with Bitmoji, and Instagram with stories, filters, and stickers. It’s been noted that Snapchat is ripping off JibJab, and bears some resemblance to the deepfakes of Zao, but it doesn’t appear to be going for realism. Snapchat also needs to stay on its spectacular rebound after a turbulent year of plunging earnings and users, and it very publicly freaked out about that. You can swap genders! Age yourself! 3D spectacles: now in Gucci! Meanwhile it’s been quietly tidying up the messes, like reorganizing its disruptive redesign. Last week the Information also reported some murmurings of a plan to sort out the Discover tab chaos, with a dedicated “news” section for journalistic Snapchat shows like NBC’s Stay Tuned.
The new one could satiate the same irresistible desire which captivated us with filters, except an even more frantic and aggressively cheerful bid to hook users who feed data to these apps because we can not resist the urge to put our faces on things. I’ve never felt more like an infant in my adult life. Or it’s just a fun feature. That’s always possible.
Snap tells Gizmodo that they will be unrolling Cameos on December 18th.
This post has been updated to include confirmation from Snap.

    <h5 class="mb-1">21 Tips to Make Google Docs, Sheets and Slides Work for You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides have evolved to become very component online productivity tools, enabling you to churn out documents, spreadsheets and presentations from any computer (with other collaborators, if necessary). But are you taking full advantage of everything these web apps have to offer? These 21 tips will save you time, improve your work, and help you do more with these apps.
Set up a row of bookmarks with docs.new, sheets.new, and slides.new in them, and you’ve got a one-click way of opening up new documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in your Google Drive—think of all the seconds you’ll save by not using the menus each time.
Don’t let a break in internet connectivity slow you down by enabling offline editing and file creation in Docs, Sheets, and Slides: From the main Google Drive screen on the web, click the cog icon (top right), then choose Settings, then tick the checkbox next to Offline.
If you do use Google Drive on the web to get at Docs, Sheets, and Slides, you can open the same Settings pane (see above) and fit more files on the screen at once, via the Density drop-down menu—you get to choose between Comfortable, Cosy, and Compact.
Google Docs on the web recently added the option to see your word count rise (and fall) in real time, which might help you hit your deadlines faster. Pick Tools and Word count, then tick the box marked Display word count while typing (other stats can be shown too).
Have you ever run the experiment to see if you can speak faster than you can type? In Google Docs on the web, click Tools and Voice typing, then try dictating documents rather than tapping them out (you might be surprised at how good the transcription is).
Did you know you can link between documents? When you hit Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on a Mac), just paste in the file URL or search for it in the link box; you can replace “edit” with “preview” at the end of any Docs URL to link to a cleaner version of a document.
Docs, Sheets, and Slides come with more than just a simple undo option—they offer a layered version history so you can go back to that version from last Sunday you really liked, or from before that guy from accounts got involved. Click File then Version history.
Docs comes with an Automatic Substitution tool that works a little bit like the autocorrect on your phone—you can use it to preempt common mistakes or even to use shortcuts for certain words and phrases. Select Tools and then Preferences to make changes to the list.
Docs lives on the web, so you can drop in a few new fonts with ease: They can revamp the look of a document and even boost your productivity. Click the font drop-down on the toolbar, then choose More fonts, and you can browse through a wide selection of typefaces.
Google Sheets is more versatile in terms of layouts than you might have realized: Use the Text rotation button on the right of the toolbar on the web to put text at a certain angle. Either pick from one of the presets that appear, or enter an angle for the text manually.
Sheets will ping your inbox as soon as there’s any change to a shared spreadsheet, if you like: Click Tools then Notification rules to configure the way this works. You can pick between getting alerts straight away and getting a daily email digest of all the changes.
Keyboard shortcuts are of course one of the ultimate productivity hacks, and Docs, Sheets, and Slides have got a bunch of them you can make use of. To see the keyboard shortcuts at your disposal, choose Help then Keyboard shortcuts from inside one of the web apps.
Take some of the strain off your aching fingers by assigning macros to common tasks in Google Sheets—if you open up the Tools menu you can click Macro then Record macro to register keystrokes and clicks that can then be replayed at any time with a shortcut.
Having multiple people work on one spreadsheet in Sheets can make it hard to keep track of what’s what, and to ensure certain data stays fixed. By selecting a group of cells, right-clicking, then choosing Protect cells, you can put limits on who can make edits.
Google Sheets works nicely with a host of third-party plug-ins and services, including the always excellent IFTTT (If This Then That). It’s possible to create automatic feeds for all kinds of useful data, from the info stored on your fitness tracker to the day’s weather.
There’ll be plenty of times in Google Slides where you want to make an identical copy of an object or text box, and the web app includes a useful shortcut for this: Hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Option (Mac), then click and drag an object to make a duplicate next to it.
Don’t panic if you only want to show part of a YouTube video inside one of your presentations in Slides, because this can be organized for you: Right-click on the video, choose Format options, and look under the Video playback settings on the right.
You want your presentations to look their best, so make sure your slides are neatly arranged. From the View and Guides menu, use Show guides to display guidelines, and Edit guides to modify them. Make sure View, Snap to, Guides is selected as well.
If you’re wrangling with trying to create something on a slide, an add-on can probably help—select Add-ons then Get add-ons to see what’s on offer. They cover interactive questions, flowcharts, music notation, live polls, maths equations and much more.
You might often need to build a new slide that’s very closely matched to one that you’ve already created. Right-click on a slide thumbnail on the left and choose Duplicate slide.
When it comes to presenting your Slides presentations, why not make use of Google’s own Chromecast technology, if it’s set up wherever you are? It’s simple and reliable, and you can connect by clicking the arrow next to Present, then Present on another screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Calendar finally lets you move events across calendars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re a frequent user of Google Calendar you’ve probably noticed that the Android app has far fewer features than the desktop version. The desktop is typically viewed as the more “productive” platform, but tons of people rely on their phones for productivity as well. Google is now bringing a long-time desktop feature to Android: moving events between calendars.
Google Calendar for Android has had the ability to copy and duplicate events for a while, but this left the event on multiple calendars. Now, through a server-side update, you can move an event from one calendar to another. To move an event, go into the Edit interface for an event and you can tap the calendar at the top to move it.

This is much more convenient for those times when plans change or you mistakenly create an event on the wrong calendar. As mentioned, this is a server-side update, so you can’t simply update the app to get it. You can try force closing and clearing the cache, but that may not work either. We’re glad to see Google continue to work on bringing the mobile version of Google Calendar up to feature parity with the desktop.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google’s first “Pixel feature drop” includes post-snap Portrait Mode, auto Call Screen, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this month, Google rolled out the December Android security patches. The company made some changes to the format they have traditionally used for these monthly releases. Instead of listing “functional patches” on the Pixel Bulletin, Google moved them to the Pixel Community Forum. Today, the company announced another change to how Pixel devices will receive updates with the first-ever “Pixel feature drop.”
Google describes Pixel feature drops as follows:
This inaugural feature drop includes a couple of great features. First, we’ll start with Google Photos. Portrait Mode is a great feature in the Google Camera app, but it does require you to proactively switch modes before snapping a photo. You will now be able to retroactively turn on Portrait Mode on Pixel devices with Google Photos.
Next up is automatic Call Screen on Pixel devices, which is something we discovered in an APK teardown. Google Assistant can automatically screen unknown callers and filter detected robocalls before your phone rings. If the call was not a robocall, your phone will ring a few moments later and show context about who is calling and why. You can find transcripts of these calls in the Dialer app. Google mentions that this is an update to Call Screen specifically on the Pixel 4.
There are a few other odds and ends included in the feature drop. Google Duo gets smoother video calls on poor connections thanks to sound prediction with machine learning and the 90Hz display on the Pixel 4 helps reduce choppiness. Duo also has a new Portrait Mode-esque filter. Memory management has been “enhanced” across all Pixel devices so you can run more apps at the same time. Google also highlighted the features that users discovered in the last security update.
So that’s it for the first Pixel feature drop. This is essentially a rebranded and much more consumer-facing approach to the “functional patches” found in security updates. Google can elaborate on the features much more and make sure users know what’s new.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Ultimate Sit-Stand Desk Costs Less Than You Think</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you sit at a desk for long periods of time every day you’ve likely heard about the supposed health risks associated with it. You’ve also probably done some research on sit-stand desks and found out that they can be pretty expensive. The prices have come down a lot recently, but you can still easily spend over $500 for a fully motorized standing desk. Autonomous is a company making high-quality standing desks, and the SmartDesk 2 Home Office is more affordable than you might expect.
The key to actually using a standing desk as often as you should is for it to be convenient. Some of the cheaper “standing desk” options are devices that you place on your desk and have to manually lift up. There are also some integrated desks that use a manual crank for raising and lowering. These sound like good ways to save some money, but in the end, they become a nuisance and you revert to sitting. A standing desk with a built-in motor and preset heights is the easiest solution, and you don’t have to pay a lot for it with the Autonomous SmartDesk 2 Home Office.
The SmartDesk 2 Home Office starts at only $329 and it includes everything you need: frame, desktop, motor, and controls. The control pad includes an LED display, simple up and down arrows to raise and lower, plus 4 programmable height settings. Once you find the perfect height for sitting and standing, you only have to press a button once to go there. The desk rises smoothly and quietly, so you don’t have to worry about your coffee tipping over.
You can customize the look of your desk with a number of color options. For only $329, you can mix and match between white, black, walnut, and white oak tops and white, black, or grey frames. You can also spend a little more and get a bamboo top for $379 or get a bigger 70.5 x 30-inch top for $419. With all of these options, you can make sure the desk fits in with your office decor.
Autonomous has a few other standing desks to choose from as well. The SmartDesk 2 Business Office has a three-segment frame that can go up to 52-inches and start at $399. The L-Shaped SmartDesk has a large footprint that’s perfect for corners and starts at $529. Autonomous also offers an Art Desk, a curved Executive desk, a Double Desk, and a DIY kit that doesn’t include the desktop. Autonomous also offers chairs, standing mats, and other accessories to deck out your office.
Improving your health and focus at work doesn’t have to be costly. The Autonomous SmartDesk 2 has all the bells and whistles you could need, plus plenty of customization options to fit in any workspace. Don’t wait any longer to try out a standing desk!

    <h5 class="mb-1">OPPO Enco Q1 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Earphones Review — Accurate Marketing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earphones are great. They let you listen to what you want to without disturbing others. And, more importantly, they let other people listen to what they want to, without disturbing you. Today we’re going to take a look at the OPPO Enco Q1 wireless noise-cancelling earphones.
While many companies are hopping on the true-wireless bandwagon, OPPO went for something completely different. These earphones have a stiff neckband, similar to the LG Tone series, but it is flexible and contoured. Having a neckband comes with its own sets of advantages and disadvantages, which I’ll talk about later. OPPO is advertising up to 22 hours of battery life, active noise cancellation, great sound, and incredible comfort with the Enco Q1. How accurate are these statements? Does the title give it away? Maybe, maybe not. Read on to find out.
“Oh God, he’s starting out by talking about the box again, isn’t he?”
Yes, yes I am. The box that the OPPO Enco Q1 comes in is actually pretty big. It’s only about an inch tall, but it’s nearly a foot in both other dimensions. There’s a reason for the size, though, and it has to do with how these earphones are constructed. Besides the earphones themselves, OPPO includes some manuals, a charging cable, and a bunch of replacement tips. Interestingly, there are actually four sizes here; the ones that come installed are in between the medium and large replacement tips in size. There’s no charging case, but that’s because these aren’t true wireless earphones.
The design of the Enco Q1 is pretty similar to the older LG Tone models. There’s a neckband, which is where the battery and controls are, and the earphones are attached by wires. In the age of truly wireless earphones, you might wonder why you’d ever want to get a pair that are both tethered and have the extra weight of a neckband. Well, maybe you don’t ever want to, and that’s perfectly fine. But there are a few good reasons for the band, which I’ll get into later as well.
Finishing off the first impressions, the OPPO Enco Q1 has your usual handy prompts for power and connection state and such. Oh, they also have this little thing called Active Noise Cancellation. Maybe you’ve heard of it before? Active noise cancellation can be great if you want to listen to something in a noisy environment, and I was super excited to see that OPPO included it. How well does it actually work, though? Well, let’s get started with the actual review to find out.
Since the OPPO Enco Q1 has a neckband, you won’t find capacitive touch controls on oi. Instead, there are four physical buttons on the left side of the band. One button is for changing the EQ mode and toggling noise cancellation. The volume rocker is for changing the volume or the current music track. The last is for powering the Enco on or off, enabling pairing mode, playing or pausing music, and answering or ending calls. You can also do a quick double press to trigger the voice assistant on your phone.
There’s nothing super fancy here, but that means it’s also super easy to remember (and get used to) which button does what, and the fact that you get proper tactile feedback when you’re doing something is always nice to have. Unlike earphones with capacitive controls, it’s much harder to accidentally pause your music or skip a track.
OPPO has opted for a simpler, less-feature-creepy approach to controls here, and, in my opinion, it works well.
I mentioned it earlier, but this thing has a neckband. For a lot of people, that might be a little off-putting. After all, neckbands can be heavy and get in the way. On its website, OPPO says that “you’ll barely notice it’s there,” and, honestly, it’s true. Usually, you need to take whatever a brand claims on its website with some skepticism, but this is at least one thing on the product page that’s completely true. Unless I’m doing sit-ups or something that involves a lot of movement, I don’t even notice I’m wearing the Enco Q1, thanks to its 42g weight.
Now that I’m done gushing about the neckband, let’s actually talk about how the earphones fit. The OPPO Enco Q1 actually comes with four tip sizes. That means there’s plenty of choices if they don’t fit you right away. Once you find the right tip size, the Enco Q1 is plenty comfortable. I’ve worn them until they run out of battery without my ears getting sore or uncomfortable.
There are just two things to keep in mind when you’re putting the earphones in. The first is that you need to sort of twist them into your ears. If you’re used to noise-isolating in-ear earphones, this won’t be anything new. The second involves the noise cancellation feature. Because the OPPO Enco Q1 uses microphones facing into your ears for noise cancellation, if you twist them in while the feature is active, it’s possible they’ll make a high-pitched squealing noise. I usually just put up with that possibility, but it’s a good idea to just turn off the noise cancellation while you’re putting the earphones in.
When they’re not in your ears, the neckband of the OPPO Enco Q1 makes for a pretty convenient way to hold and anchor the earphones. Just take them out of your ears, stick them together (each bud has a magnet in the back for this reason), and forget about them. Well, forget about them until you lean forward. The wires attaching the earphones to the neckband are pretty long. While that’s good for reachability and in-ear comfort, it means they can get in the way when you don’t have them in your ears. For example, when leaning over a sink, there’s a real risk of getting them wet. They are IPX4-rated, but that doesn’t mean they won’t break at all as IPX4 is good only for light splashes of water.
The magnets that hold the earphones together are also not very strong, and I’ve had them come apart a few times. That’s not a big deal by any means, but it’s definitely something worth keeping in mind.
One last thing for this section, I promise. The OPPO Enco Q1 are rated IPX4. That means you don’t need to worry about wearing them in the rain, or for an intense workout. You shouldn’t go swimming with them, obviously, but an unexpected rain shower won’t cause any problems.
I’ve worn the Enco Q1 until they run out of battery. With active noise cancellation enabled, OPPO claims the Enco Q1 will last for about 15 hours of playback. Without active noise cancellation, that number jumps to 22 hours. Again, the marketing here is spot-on, at least for the ANC mode. I’ve had no trouble getting 15 hours or more of playback time out of the Enco Q1. I’ve barely used them without ANC enabled, so I can’t personally say how accurate the 22-hour estimate is, but I am inclined to believe it. Those 15 hours of playtime are more than enough for almost any general use-case, and it’s so nice not having to worry about charging these every few hours.
Now let’s talk about the other end of battery life: the charging process. OPPO says it takes about two hours for the Enco Q1 to charge, which isn’t exactly quick. But you don’t really need fast charging when you can just plug them in overnight. Thankfully, the OPPO Enco Q1 charge with USB-C, so you don’t need to carry around a Micro-USB cable with you. Your phone charger will work just fine.
Features and playback time are nice and all, but what about sound? The features don’t mean much if the sound quality is terrible. Well, no need to worry. The OPPO Enco Q1 sounds great, thanks to the 11.8mm dynamic driver. The default EQ profile is perfect for my preferences. Treble and vocals are clear, but there’s also bass when it’s needed.
Of course, if you’re someone who likes heavier bass, what I just said may not really sound that great. Maybe the Tronsmart Spunky Pro sound like more your jam. Lucky for you, the OPPO Enco Q1 comes with a few different EQ modes: music, cinema, and gaming. If none of those work for you, there’s always your phone’s built-in equalizer. ColorOS is pretty bad, but it does have an equalizer, and One UI has some pretty advanced sound control if you have a Samsung.
But what about the noise cancellation feature? I’ll admit I was a little skeptical of this actually working well, but after over a month of using it, I’m pretty happy. Obviously, it isn’t perfect. These are just in-ear earphones, not headphones. But for what they have to work with, the OPPO Enco Q1 provides a solid noise-cancelling experience.
I’ve actually taken to using the noise cancellation in lectures to help tune out noises like coughing and sniffing. On the train to and from home, the Enco manage to block out nearly all of the noise from the wheels on the track. I’ve even started to turn my headphones volume lower than usual, since there’s just so much less background noise to overcome. Needless to say, I really enjoy the noise cancellation feature here, and I wish more earphones had it.
So we’ve talked about sound quality and noise cancellation, but there’s one more thing to cover: the microphone(s). On top of all the microphones for noise cancellation, the OPPO Enco Q1 has at least one more for other regular functions like phone calls, video calls and apps like Duolingo. I’ve actually made a surprising number of calls with these and I never got complaints about the clarity of the phone call.
Honestly, I’m incredibly happy with the OPPO Enco Q1. From the comfortable design to the amazing battery life and the excellent sound quality, they get so many things right. That doesn’t mean they’re perfect, as the magnets could definitely be stronger, but OPPO did a great job designing them.
You can get yourself a pair of the OPPO Enco Q1 for around $100 online. That’s not exactly cheap, but it’s half of what Apple charges for noise-cancelling earphones. Unless you really want true-wireless noise-cancelling earphones, these are a pretty great deal. Of course, if you don’t care about noise cancellation in the first place, then that doesn’t really matter. But with the 22-hour playtime and great sound, noise cancellation isn’t the only reason to buy these. The Anker Soundcore Spirit Pro may “only” be $50, but the sound is nowhere near as good, and the playtime is less than half of what the OPPO Enco Q1 manages.
I know $100+ is a lot to ask for a pair of earphones, but I really do think these are worth the price. Unfortunately, they’re a little hard to find. They’re not sold officially in very many countries. If you’re in China, you can get them directly from OPPO’s website. Users in India can buy them from Amazon India for ₹7,990. For other regions, check Amazon or eBay. Depending on the seller, you can find them for as low as $80 or $90.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ring is branching out from its usual doorbells and security cameras to produce truly connected lighting, although it's probably not going to replace your corner table lamps any time soon. An FCC filing has revealed that the Amazon-owned firm is prepping a Bluetooth-capable light bulb. It appears to be a floodlight that would complement Ring's existing security systems, but it's still a significant step for a company whose dedicated lighting has so far been limited to self-contained systems rather than screw-in bulbs.
It's not clear when Ring's bulb might arrive. CES 2020 is around the corner in January, but there are no guarantees Ring and Amazon will launch then. Whenever it arrives, it'll be good news for those who want to catch would-be thieves and aren't put off by Ring's privacy issues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's first CES appearance in 28 years is all about privacy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple hasn't had an official presence at CES since the Newton's debut in 1992, but it's about to come back... in a very modest way. The company's Senior Director of Global Privacy, Jane Horvath, is due to speak at a roundtable where she and her peers will share their beliefs on what customers want for privacy protections. There won't be an announcement, a keynote or a booth, then -- this is really about articulating views to industry and the press.
In addition to Apple, you can also expect execs from Facebook and Procter & Gamble as well as FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter.
Apple has had an unofficial effect on CES in the 28 years since its last formal appearance. The more Apple-centric Macworld Expo frequently took place in a similar time frame, and it occasionally upstaged everything at CES -- it's no secret that the iPhone unveiling stole much of CES' thunder in January 2007. There have long been reports of Apple staff roaming the show floor to scout the competition, and Apple not-so-subtly trolled rivals at CES 2019 with an ad that made its privacy position clear. Throw in the many, many companies bringing Apple-oriented accessories to the event and the company has been hard to escape.
Still, this is a notable step. It's unlikely that Apple will return to announcing products at CES when the company is well-known for wanting control over when and how it conducts launches. This does, however, indicate that Apple is more willing to engage with the rest of the industry, if just to get its message across.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After launching in a limited, invite-only beta earlier this year, GOG Galaxy 2.0 is now available to anyone who wants to try it. You can join the open beta by visiting the GOG Galaxy website and downloading the new client on your PC or Mac.
As before, owner CD Projekt says the goal of its app is to unify your disparate game libraries and friends lists in one place. While you'll still need to have launchers like Steam and the Epic Games Store on your computer, GOG Galaxy 2.0 allows you to install and play any games you may have on those platforms using its client. You can also link your Xbox and PlayStation accounts to GOG Galaxy 2.0, allowing you to see your console games as well -- no need for a spreadsheet. At the moment, GOG Galaxy 2.0 supports 20 platforms, either officially or through community-made integrations. Some of the bigger ones include Steam, Origin, Uplay and the Epic Games Store.
We took a look at GOG Galaxy 2.0 earlier this year when it was in closed beta. At the time, the client didn't have a lot of features, but it did allow us to organize the majority of our games. Since then, GOG has been busy at work adding features that enhance the platform's original pitch. With its latest patch, for example, GOG Galaxy now allows you to see the online status of your friends across different gaming platforms. It's a nifty feature that makes it easier to pull your buddies into an online game like Destiny 2. GOG Galaxy 2.0 probably won't spell the end of store exclusives like Hades and Metro Exodus, but it will least make them easier to handle.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this year, Domino's Pizza said it would let you track your pizza deliveries using GPS. And, well, the company is now delivering on that promise. Domino's announced today that approximately a quarter of its locations across the US will have the technology in place by the end of this year. In 2020, a "significant portion" of Domino's remaining locations will allow you to track your order through the company's mobile app.
If the Domino's Pizza you're ordering from supports GPS delivery tracking, you'll also be able to opt into text notifications. By doing so, you'll get messages when your pizza is two minutes away and when it has arrived at your door. Domino's will also send you an SMS when your food is on its way. In this way, you can track where your order is without constantly looking at the Domino's app.
The chain is no stranger to technology, especially when it comes to tech that has the potential to streamline deliveries. Earlier this year, the company said it would start testing autonomous delivery vehicles in Houston. However, it's a bit strange to see Domino's come so late to GPS. After all, unlike autonomous robots, GPS is a mature technology that has been around for a while.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Bayonetta’ & ‘Vanquish’ bundle comes to PS4 and Xbox One in February</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, multiple retailers leaked the existence of a Bayonetta and Vanquish bundle for PS4 and Xbox One. Today, we have confirmation that the compilation is on its way and that the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X owners will be able to play the games in 4K at 60 FPS. Collectors will be happy to learn that the physical version will come packed in an embossed SteelBook case.
Gamers who have already played these cult classics may want to give them another whirl in 4K, while those who haven't owe it to themselves to try them out. Bayonetta is arguably one of the best 3D action games around. It borrows from the Devil May Cry formula -- developer PlatinumGames is made up of several Capcom vets -- but is even more frenetic, stylish and ridiculous. Vanquish puts a Japanese twist on the western third-person over-the-shoulder action game with a tokusatsu-style power suit, loads of crazy weapons and an addicting power-slide mechanic.
A quick word of caution for PS4 gamers: The PS3 port of Bayonetta was outsourced to another developer and is riddled with issues; it's the one version of the game to avoid. It would be a bummer if the PS4 version of the bundle uses this same port. If that's the case, it might be a good idea to grab both the bundle and some other version of Bayonetta such as the Xbox 360, Steam or Switch release. That said, if Sega is going through the effort to upgrade the game to modern standards, it seems somewhat unlikely that it would use a version of the game known to be second-rate.
If you don't care about the SteelBook case, you may want to pre-order the digital version of the game to get a free console theme, at least for PS4 -- we haven't heard anything about pre-order bonuses for Xbox One owners yet. Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle will be out on PS4 and Xbox One on February 18 for $39.99. Bayonetta 3 was announced as a Nintendo Switch exclusive almost two years ago to the day. Since then, we've heard very little. But hopefully this bundle is an indication that PlatinumGames is still dedicated to the series.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar's I-Pace software update boosts the range by 12 miles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Car makers frequently make vague claims that their racing technology leads to improvements in road-going vehicles, but this is one of those precious few moments where the gains are very tangible. Jaguar is delivering an update to its I-Pace EV that promises up to 12 miles of extra range thanks partly to know-how gleaned from the eTrophy race series. The automaker has boosted the efficiency of the car's AWD torque distribution, reduced use of the radiator vanes that keep it cool (improving aerodynamics) and allowed the battery to run to a lower state of charge without compromising performance or durability.
Other tweaks simply come from real-life driving data. The regenerative braking system is more effective at recovering energy at both low speeds and high battery levels, while range predictions should be more accurate and indicative of your driving style.
Unfortunately, the update process isn't as slick as it is with EV-focused brands like Tesla. You'll have to visit a Jaguar dealership to get this upgrade. Take heart, though: the same update also allows for more components to receive over-the-air updates, potentially sparing you some repeat visits in the future.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over two and a half years after Microsoft said it'd one day kill to-do service Wunderlist in favor of its own To Do app, it has revealed when it'll drop the ax: May 6th. After that time, Wunderlist's to-do lists won't sync anymore and you'll have a limited time to export lists from there into To Do. As of today, Microsoft won't accept any more sign-ups for Wunderlist.
Microsoft bought Wunderlist creator 6Wunderkinder in 2015 and announced To Do (or To-Do, as it was known then) in April 2017. It launched a redesigned version of To Do in September, which brought the service closer in line with Wunderlist's feature set while deepening its integration with several Microsoft services, including Outlook, Microsoft Planner and Cortana.
The plan to put Wunderlist out to pasture has been in the works for a long time. Despite founder Christian Reber's offer to buy back the service, it'll wind down in less than five months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus adds Netflix to its TVs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When OnePlus made its TV debut, releasing its OnePlus TV Q1 series in India this September, it noticeably left Netflix out of the picture. Now, Android Police reports that OnePlus is bringing the Netflix app to its TVs via a system update. Newer models will ship with Netflix preinstalled, and a redesigned remote will come with a dedicated Netflix button.
The new remote will fix a few other issues. The original was remarkably similar to Apple's TV remote, but in an attempt to be sleek, OnePlus didn't include a mute button. Instead, users had to press both volume buttons at once. The new remote will be thicker, made of plastic (rather than metal), run on AAA batteries and include dedicated mute and Netflix buttons, says Android Police. In other words, OnePlus is no longer trying to imitate Apple's less-than-perfect remote design.
The TVs are still only available in India, but it's interesting to see how they're developing ahead of what we can only assume will be a wider release. Both the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro are 55-inch 4K QLED panels with support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. They started at INR 69,000 ($972) and INR 99,900 ($1407) respectively.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You no longer need an Android phone if you want to keep your Google Maps activity (mostly) private. Google is rolling out Incognito Mode to iOS users as of today, giving you the same ability to search for and navigate to locations without leaving records behind on your account or Location History. Again, this won't affect Assistant queries or prevent outsiders from theoretically snooping on your Google Maps traffic -- this is mainly so that Google (and anyone with access to your phone) won't know what you've been looking for.
Android users are getting an additional privacy control of their own. There will soon be a bulk delete option for your Timeline so that you can quickly remove a group of places you've visited without venturing into Maps' settings and specifying date ranges. This could be particularly helpful if you've been looking for gifts and would rather not spoil the surprise when your partner borrows your phone. The feature will miss the holidays with its January rollout, but hey -- it'll be ready for next year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You don't have to wait until 2020 to try Oculus Quest hand tracking, at least so long as you're willing to accept some limits. Oculus is trotting out the controller-free input method as an option in the "Experimental Features" menu this week. You can only use it in the main interface as well as first-party apps like the web browser and Oculus TV, but that still allows you to ditch the grips for common tasks. You can switch back to controllers through a quick toggle in the home screen.
The hand tracking test will be available to you once you've updated the Quest to v12.
Third-party apps with hand tracking won't come until 2020. However, Oculus will offer a development kit next week that will make hands-only control available. The technology won't necessarily make sense in every app. We can imagine it being a particular problem in games where your hands might be out of view of the headset's cameras. It's a start, though, and there may come a time when you only pick up the controllers when you absolutely need them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's new depth feature makes its AR experiences more realistic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google has been experimenting with ARCore for the better part of two years, adding more features to its AR development platform over time. Back at I/O this year, Google introduced Environmental HDR, which brings real world lighting to AR objects and scenes. Today, it's incorporating a Depth API that will introduce occlusion, 3D understanding, and a new level of realism.
Google is first bringing this new Depth feature to search, which it introduced earlier this year with augmented reality animals. For example, if you search for the word "cat", you'll see an image of a 3D cat in its Google search card. Select "View in your space" and the app will access your camera, showing you the cat in the real world around you. To see the capabilities of ARCore's new Depth API, you can also then enable or disable occlusion. When disabled, the cat will float above the environment, but when enabled, the cat will be partially obscured behind furniture or other real-world objects.
On top of that, Google has also partnered with Houzz to incorporate this Depth API in its home design app. Starting today, Houzz users can see how this works with the "View in My Room 3D" experience. Now, instead of just placing furniture in the room, the new occlusion option will let you see a more realistic preview of how furniture will really look in a room. So, for example, you'll be able to see a chair behind the table, instead of floating on top of it.
In a demo at Google's San Francisco office, I saw how developers could use the new ARCore Depth API to create a depth map using a regular smartphone camera; red indicates closer areas while blue are for areas that are further in the distance. Also, in addition to occlusion, Google says that having this depth understanding of the world also allows developers to play with real-world physics, surface interaction and more.
One example that I tried out was when I threw virtual objects in a real-world living room setup. The digital objects respected the curvature and angles of the furniture, piling up in a narrow cavity or spreading all over the place in a wider, flatter space. Virtual robots climbed over real-world chairs, and virtual snow fell on each individual leaf on a real-world plant. One particularly fun demo was when playing a virtual food fight, where I could use real-world furniture as barricades.
According to Google, all of this is possible with the over 200 Android devices out there that are already ARCore-compatible. It doesn't require specialty sensors or equipment, though the addition of new sensors in future will likely make the tech even more lifelike.
Aside from Google's search and the new Houzz app, ARCore's Depth API isn't implemented in other consumer applications just yet. If developers are interested in trying this out in their own projects, they'll have to fill out this form to apply.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Minecraftfans on PlayStation 4 will be able to play with their buddies on other platforms such as Xbox One, PCs and mobile devices starting Tuesday. Mojang is at last updating the PS4 version of its colossally successful title to the Bedrock version, which will finally enable Minecraft'scross-platform play on Sony's console.
The update, which should be available on PS4 at 11AM ET/8AM PT, will also bring the Minecraft Marketplace to the console. You won't have to pay extra for the Bedrock update, and those who buy Minecraft on the platform from now on will also get cross-play access.
Players on all platforms will need to be running the 1.14 update to take advantage of cross-play. The update has been a long time coming for PS4 players, as Xbox One, Switch, PC and mobile Minecraft fans have been playing together for 18 months.
Minecraft's PS4 cross-play arrives after Sony relaxed its restrictions on cross-play over the last year or so. It opened up cross-platform multiplayer access to all developers in October. Several other major titles offer PS4 cross-play, including Fortnite, Rocket League, Call of Duty: Modern Warfareand PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was only a matter of time before China started offering trade bans to US companies in return for the ban on Huawei's gear. The Financial Times is reporting that Beijing has ordered all government institutions and public bodies to get rid of their foreign (i.e. western) computer gear. According to the report, China will spend between now and 2022 transitioning off American hardware and software in favor of local alternatives.
This isn't the first time that China has publicly (and not-so publicly) declared American technology as persona non grata within its government. But the move may have more urgency this time as the country looks to push back against the broader geopolitical picture. Not to mention that other nations, like Russia, are also doing their best to push domestic technology onto their citizens.
China is also looking for ways to better control the internet and keep its data within its borders, following the 2017 China Internet Security Law. One of its tentpole features is a rule to ensure that all technology is "secure" and "controllable," which is, as usual, particularly troubling.
Companies likely to face pain include Microsoft, who already has a testy relationship with the country, Dell, HP and Apple. Although it's worth saying that, as with any technology product sourced from around the world, what constitutes a domestic product. After all, the FT uses Lenovo as an example: a Chinese company that sources chips from Intel (US) and hard-drives from Samsung (Korea).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Do you know the way to San Jose? It doesn't matter if you're in a self-driving car. As they previewed earlier this year, Bosch and Mercedes-Benz have commenced trials for an automated ride-hailing service in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose. To start with, autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz vehicles (with safety drivers at the wheel) will shuttle "a select group of users" between North San Jose and downtown.
The busy San Carlos/Stevens Creek corridor between west San Jose and downtown should be good test for the self-driving tech used by Mercedes and Bosch. Rather than just playing with prototypes, the companies want to create a production-ready SAE Level 4/5 self-driving system that can be built into different makes and models. To do that, they're using a combination of AI, a million-square foot proving ground in Stuttgart and the real world San Jose ride-hailing tests.
San Jose is expected to grow by 40 percent over the next two years, so the city wants to see the impact of autonomous cars. "We want to know more about how automated vehicles can help improve safety and reduce congestion, as well as make mobility more available, sustainable, and inclusive," said San Jose project director Dolan Beckel in a statement. "If automated driving is to become everyday reality, the technology has to work reliably and safely."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung’s Galaxy S11+ Could Come With a Custom 108MP Camera for Enhanced Image Quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S11 flagship won't be for another couple of months. However, leaks keep painting a picture for all of us looking forward to the device and what it will have in store for users. The latest leak regarding the handset states that the Galaxy S11+ will be equipped with a whopping 108MP camera sensor for enhanced image quality. Let's dive in to see some more details on the Galaxy S11+ 108MP camera and what can we expect from the larger sensor.
As mentioned earlier, the camera sensor is physically larger than the traditional smartphone cameras. Samsung will use a 1/1.3-inch 108MP sensor and in contrast, the Galaxy S10 boasts a 1/1.255-inch 12MP sensor. If the leak ever sees daylight, we can expect the primary sensor on the Galaxy S11+ to be substantially bigger, even bigger than what Huawei uses in its Mate 30 Pro.
Low-Res Galaxy S11 Live Images Pay Close Attention to Large Rear-Mounted Camera Hump
Apart from this, the leak suggests that this is not an ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor, but a custom sensor for enhanced picture quality. Since it is a custom sensor, we can expect it to be more expensive compared to the 108MP sensor on Xiaomi smartphones which we have seen recently.
One of the major aspects bolstering the superior image quality is the larger sensor. Conjoined with better image processing, low-light photography along with dynamic range could potentially receive a major boost since the sensor would be able to take in more light. If you're unfamiliar, here's how the Galaxy S11 looks in these leaked images.
The 108MP primary camera on the Galaxy S11+ will be one of the five cameras which are rumored to be part of the mix. Other sensors include an ultra-wide-angle shooter, a ToF sensor and a 5X Telephoto sensor. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for more details on Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S11+ camera and more.
This is all for now, folks. What are your views on the Galaxy S11+ 108MP camera sensor? Are you looking forward to it? Sound off in the comments, we would love to hear it from you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy S11+ could use a custom 108MP sensor for superior image quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new leak pertaining to the Galaxy S11+ points to Samsung using a massive 1/1.3-inch 108MP sensor on the handset.
Apart from 108 million pixels, the sensor itself is also physically bigger than a traditional smartphone camera sensor. For comparison, the Galaxy S10 comes with a 1/2.55-inch 12MP camera, while the Huawei Mate 30 Pro features a 1/1.7-inch 40MP sensor. This means that if the rumor ends up being true, the primary camera sensor on the Galaxy S11+ will be substantially bigger than what Huawei uses in its smartphones as well.
This is not the same 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that Samsung has developed in collaboration with Xiaomi. Instead, the Korean company apparently plans on using an "exclusive custom sensor" that offers superior image quality when compared to the 108MP camera sensor we have seen so far in a couple of Xiaomi smartphones. This custom sensor will also be more expensive than the 108MP Bright HMX sensor.
Apart from sensor quality and image processing improvements, the bigger sensor on the Galaxy S11+ will give it a major advantage in low-light scenarios. The dynamic range will also be better as the bigger sensor will be able to absorb more light.
The Galaxy S11+ is expected to come with a penta-camera setup which apart from the 108MP camera is expected to include an ultra-wide angle shooter, a 5x telephoto sensor, and a ToF sensor.
Rumors surrounding the Galaxy S11+ point to it coming with an 108MP camera sensor that can record 8K videos. The phone will also come with some innovative new camera modes, a 120Hz AMOLED display, and an Exynos 990/Snapdragon 865 chipset along with 12GB RAM. Renders of the Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+ have also already leaked giving us a clear look at their design.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key point: This handgun is compact, reliable, and has sold well.
In 2017, Smith & Wesson refreshed its Military and Police Shield (M&P Shield) series of compact handguns. The result was the M&P Shield 2.0. The M&P Shield 2.0 has all the features of a full-sized pistol in a package small enough for concealed carry. Smith & Wesson also offers the pistol in a wide variety of configurations, from caliber to ergonomics and aiming devices, allowing prospective buyers to pick the version that’s right for them.
The M&P Shield 2.0 is 6.1 inches long with a 3.1-inch barrel. Although Smith & Wesson considers this a compact pistol dimensionally it’s more along the lines of subcompact pistols offered by industry competitors such as Glock and Sig Sauer. The pistol weighs 18.3 ounces unloaded, making it one of the lightest pistols of its kind of the market. Smith & Wesson achieves this by combining a polymer frame, which requires rigidly but not pressure-resistant strength, with an embedded steel chassis that encases the trigger group and action. The frame and barrel are made of stainless steel finished in a black Armornite finish to resist rust and corrosion.
Another key requirement for concealed carry users, a narrow pistol, is achieved by using single column magazines. Most full-size nine-millimeter handguns pack fifteen rounds or more by using a double stack column that greatly increases the number of rounds a handgun can store. The downside is a wider grip that, although perfectly fine for duty carry, makes it more difficult to conceal on a person under clothing. The use of a single column magazine allows the M&P Shield 2.0 to have a width of just .99 inches.
A striker fired pistol, the M&P Shield 2.0 uses a striker instead of a hammer to strike a firing pin, discharging the pistol. The pistol includes a manual thumb safety. Unlike other striker fired pistols, the Shield 2.0 allows for disassembly without pulling the trigger, an important safety feature that adds a measure of safety to the takedown process. Some models include interchangeable palm swell grips of varying sizes to accommodate different hand sizes, allowing the user to create a custom fit.
The M&P Shield 2.0 is available in nine-millimeter with a seven-round flush magazine or an eight-round magazine that protrudes slightly from the magazine well. The latter holds an additional round and also provides a fuller grip for larger hands. Alternately, the pistol is available in .40 Smith & Wesson and .45 ACP versions that hold six and seven rounds, respectively, in similar magazines.
Smith and Wesson offers their compact handgun with a wide variety of aiming systems. In addition to standard, adjustable iron sights, the Shield 2.0 is sold with tritium night sights, HI-VIZ fiber optic sights, integrated Crimson Trace red laser aiming devices, and integrated flashlights. The Shield 2.0 is even offered with a cut frame and integrated four minute of angle red dot sight.
The M&P Shield 2.0 is one of the most popular compact handguns on the market, and it’s not hard to see why. The wide variety of choice, from ergonomics to aiming devices, makes it clear that Smith & Wesson is paying attention to market trends and user choice.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s much-anticipated beast of a machine, the Mac Pro, and its corresponding badass new display, the Pro Display XDR, will be available to order on December 10, per a promo the company emailed to U.S. customers.
Editor's Note: It's currently unknown if this offer extends to Australian customers.
Spotted by Twitter user Marques Brownlee, the announcement doesn’t offer any other details about how Apple plans to roll out its high-tech hardware, though Apple’s careful to word the news as its Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR will be “ready to order” on that date, i.e. shipping time (especially for any so-called cheese graters out there with customised configurations) not included.
The Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR were officially announced in June at the World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), but fans have been chomping at the bit for a redesign of Apple’s ancient, by tech standards, at least, 2013 Mac Pro for years. The company promising that a new overhauled model was on the horizon for the lasttwo years only further fanned the flames.
And, of course, Apple’s most powerful gear comes at an equally premium price, though whether they’re actually worth it is another question entirely. The 32-inch Pro Display XDR starts at $US5,000 ($7,310), while its controversial and separately sold Pro Stand (a literal stand, in case you couldn’t tell by the name), which allows you to tilt and rotate your screen, comes in at a grand.
As for the Mac Pro, models start at $US6,000 ($8,771), which comes with an eight-core Xeon processor, AMD Radeon Pro 580, 16GB of RAM, and a pitiful 256GB of storage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">If there’s such a thing as gaming phone, the Asus ROG Phone II Ultimate is it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The concept of a 'gaming' phone is relatively new, albeit one Asus has embraced, starting with the original ROG Phone and then the ROG Phone II. Who knows when or if a third-generation model will come out. In the meantime, Asus is bolstering its ROG Phone II with an Ultimate model that ups the ante with more RAM and storage.
It's now available in the UK direct from Asus for £899.99, and is up for preorder in the US at B&H Photo for $1,099.99. Or at least I think those are the correct links—keeping track of the variations and SKUs is a little confusing because of the different hardware configurations, matte black and glossy finishes, and different part numbers in different regions of the world.
There are three main models available—Strix, Elite, and Ultimate. Here's a general breakdown of the RAM and storage on each:
The new Ultimate model is the highest-end configuration, which further separates itself from the other two with 4G LTE connectivity supporting downloads up to 2Gbps (Cat 20), versus 4G LTE up to 1.2Gbps (Cat 18) on the Elite and 4G LTE up to 1Gbps (Cat 16) on the Strix.
All three models feature a 6.59-inch AMOLED display with a 2340x1080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and HDR support. The fast refresh rate brings parity between the ROG Phone II and competing models like the Razer Phone (first and second-gen), though Asus claims bragging rights by being first to offer 120Hz on an OLED screen.
This is all powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor clocked at 2.96Ghz with Adreno 640 graphics. There's also a monstrous 6,000mAh battery pack inside.
As with the first-gen ROG Phone, the ROG Phone II (including the new Ultimate model) employs "Air Triggers," which are areas you can tap on the side of the phone to serve as shoulder buttons. This time around, they support both tap and slide motions.
I've spent some hands on time with the ROG Phone II (and the ROG Phone before that). If there's such a thing as a gaming phone, the ROG Phone II is it. Between the powerful hardware (for a phone), innovative Air Triggers, fast refresh rate, large battery, and an ecosystem of accessories, it's probably as close to the concept as it can get, while still being a phone.
It's also a bit on the chunky and heavy side, for a modern flagship, and the aesthetics are decidedly ROG (a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your vantage point). So there's your trade off.
I'm not about to ditch my PC as my gaming platform of choice. Still, the ROG Phone II seems like a prime candidate for Google's Stadia platform, if it's ever supported. As for right now, there's no word from Google or Asus on when or if that will happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero gaming headset review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Turtle Beach is a household name when it comes to gaming headsets, offering reasonable quality devices that range from the cheap end of the scale to the mid-range. The Elite Atlas Aero falls somewhere in the middle of these two, coming in at $120/£130, but what does it offer compared to other gaming headsets at the same price? And where does it really fit in with all the other Turtle Beach offerings from the past couple of years? It’s not the cheapest, nor the most expensive, nor the most feature-packed.
Initial impressions of the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero are strong; the headset is packaged in its folded state, which is ideal for portability. One earcup completely folds into the other, so you don’t have a huge bulky pair of cans to transport. One big complaint I had though was the size of the headband itself; I don’t have a particularly large head but had to extend the headband to almost the full length and, even then, the headset feels tight when worn for lengthy periods. If you’re someone who typically has a big noggin, bear this in mind because the device might not physically fit comfortably.
Price: $119.99Wireless: YesDriver-type: 50mm Nanoclear driversImpedance: 32 ohms @ 1kHzFrequency response: 12Hz -20,000HzDesign style: Over-earMicrophone: ProGaming MicConnectivity: Bluetooth wireless
Setting up the headset isn’t particularly difficult. It comes with a USB bluetooth transmitter, which connects without problem thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions, but unfortunately it’s only compatible with PC. Mac and Linux users are short-changed here, because the Turtle Beach Control Studio is a Windows-only application, and this is where the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero seriously shines. Hardly an issue for PC gamers, but anyone looking to use it across multiple devices is a little short-changed.
The amount of customisation options available is staggering, from simple sliders like increasing the bass and treble to a preset mode dedicated to increasing footstep sounds, the Control Studio has it all. You can create your own presets here too by fiddling with the equaliser for individual sounds like car explosions, wind, vocals, and more. There are also macros to assign to specific functions so you can switch between audio modes at the press of a key, and you can import other people’s optimal settings for the specific game you’re playing.
Perhaps the most impressive part of the Elite Atlas Aero is the “Superhuman Hearing” button. This toggle activates the audio mode of the same name, which means you can hear footsteps and enemy noises from a serious distance away. I’ve played a lot of Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Rainbow Six Siege with it over the last month and the range in that mode is on another level. I’m confident in saying I’ve not heard such game enhancing audio from a headset before in my life, because it gives an incredible advantage. The general audio quality drops, but that’s to be expected. Having the single button on the underside of the left earcup means you can turn it on whenever and start detecting enemies from miles away, while they’re completely unaware.

In the same location is where you’ll find the on/off switch, along with the volume and separate mic monitoring dials (adjust the volume of your own voice for others). The only complaint I’ve got is that thanks to the position of the volume wheel on almost the exact rear of the cup, if you have a tall seat such as a traditional gaming chair, it’s easy to accidentally raise or lower the volume when you lean back by brushing the dial against the back of your chair.
When it comes to the microphone, the Elite Atlas Aero does drop a mark here for two reasons; firstly, the quality isn’t excellent. It’s not bad per se, but I’ve both heard and used better from a wireless mic, like in Sennheiser’s gaming range. It’s also impressively fiddly to plug in the detachable microphone. You have to get the exact rotation before pushing it in quite forcefully, to the point where I wasn’t sure if my attempts were futile. It’s a seriously tricky mic to plug in, which begs the question, why wasn’t this spotted in quality control? Thankfully, as someone who mainly uses a better quality external USB mic, this only affected me for testing purposes and before long I stopped using it again. It’s something to bear in mind though if you don’t have a separate mic to use, because it can cause some issues. 
The Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero product page claims the headset boasts “over 30 hours of battery life” when fully charged, and from my experience that isn’t true whatsoever. The battery life certainly isn’t bad, but if you spend a long 12 hour session using them talking on Discord and enabling the Superhuman Hearing function, you’re going to want to charge them overnight. You’ll be sorely disappointed when they die swiftly the next day if not. Our tests place it between 12-15 hours of normal gaming use.
If you’re not too concerned about the actual quality and instead want an advantage over your opponents in competitive multiplayer games where sound plays a vital role, you won’t find a better headset than the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero. It has serious value-for-money and is one of, if not the best PC headset I’ve used in that regard. There are a few minor drawbacks, but this should be your top choice if you want to rank up online.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What is it? VR stealth game with a neat concept haphazardly executed.Expect to pay $30/£23Reviewed on Oculus Quest (via Oculus Link), Windows 10, AMD Ryzen 5 3600, Nvidia GTX 2080 Super, 32 GB RAMDeveloper Digital LodePublisher Tripwire InteractiveLinkOfficial site
If Espire 1 has taught me anything, it's that crouching is really hard work. Sam Fisher must have thighs made of concrete the way he scuttles around for hours on end. If Ubisoft had wanted to make a truly realistic stealth experience, they'd include a post-mission sequence in which Fisher has to rub Ibuprofen gel into his groin.
In fairness, Espire 1 doesn't simulate the chronic inner-thigh pain that must come with being a professional sneaky bastard either. This just happens to be a by-product of its concept. Finally, there's a VR game that lets you avoid detection by physically crawling through an oversized vent. 
By all rights, this should make Espire 1 the most immersive immersive-sim ever made. Sadly, the reality doesn't quite live up to the dream. Don't get me wrong, Espire 1 has some neat ideas, and there are moments when its VR stealth simulation (quietly) sings. But it also lacks the level of mechanical finesse good stealth games need, resulting in an experience that frequently veers closer to Keystone Cops than Metal Gear Solid.
Espire 1 puts you in the role of an operative working for the Intelligence Force of Australia. The game starts immediately after an attack on one of the IFA's most secure research centres, which specialises in designing remote-controlled humanoid drones. Taking control of one such drone, your job is to infiltrate the facility, find out what the insurgents are doing, and stop them from doing it.
This slightly roundabout premise is necessary to explain Espire 1's unique approach to combating VR-induced nausea. In the game, your character is stood in a Minority-Report-like glass box, via which you control the drone telepathically. When you move the drone around (using standard FPS controls), the static box becomes visible in the periphery of your vision, while only the very centre of the screen maintains what the drone is seeing as it moves around.
These unique "comfort settings" do seem to succeed in reducing nausea by minimising the amount of movement in your peripheral vision. That said, I found the game to be relatively comfortable even with these settings switched off. As Espire 1 is a stealth game, you're frequently stopping to hide, assess guard patrols, and wait for the right moment to move, which helps reduce motion sickness anyway. 
The core of Espire 1 will be familiar to anyone who's played Thief, Splinter Cell, Metal Gear, etc. As you explore the underground R&D facility, you'll need to avoid, distract, or eliminate patrolling guards. If they spot you, they'll raise the alarm, and you'll have to either run and hide until the alerts die down or stand and fight until there's nobody left to respond.
The potential for VR stealth gaming is immediately apparent. Being able to physically lean around corners to check they're clear is very satisfying, as is physically crouching when moving to reduce the amount of noise you make (although there is an optional crouch button if you want to avoid the risk of thigh-cramp). Espire 1 also takes advantage of verticality. Your robot's magnetic hands let you clamber onto any metal surface, enabling you to shimmy up the drainpipe of a warehouse and evade guards by sneaking along the rafters.
Espire 1 is at its best when you're in full evasion mode like this, clambering hand-over-hand on the underside of a metal gantry to avoid the sights of an automated turret. My favourite mechanic is how you activate your infra-red sensors by raising your virtual hand to the side of your head and pressing the trigger of your touch controllers. This instantly gives you a Predator-like view of patrolling guards. It's very cool.
This isn't where Espire 1's neat ideas end either. You can use voice commands to sneak behind guards and shout "Freeze!" holding them up MGS 2 style. Weapons are also fun to manipulate. The bolt-action tranquiliser pistol is cocked by physically retracting the bolt on the back, while conventional weapons can be quickly reloaded by holding the gun over the magazine holster on your off-hand side (Espire 1 lets you specify your dominant hand, which is another neat touch). You can even pull magazines out of enemy weapons for extra ammo, or throw them around the environment to distract enemies.
Espire 1 has all the right components. It just doesn't always fit them together especially well. The biggest problem is AI. Guard perception is highly inconsistent. You can be stood next to them and they might not see you, but they'll spot you up on a gantry on the far side of the room. The game needs a clear, MGS-style indicator of what enemies can see. Placement of enemies can also be problematic. Several times I opened a door to a new area and was immediately spotted. Elsewhere, I've been funnelled into corridors where there's no alternate route to help avoid detection. Compared to the best stealth games—Chaos Theory, Thief II and so on—the levels are not especially well-thought out, with too many open lines of sight and too few hiding places.
Combat, meanwhile, is the weakest part of the game. Your physical inventory is great in theory, but fiddly to use in practice. The pistol holsters are too far back, meaning I'd frequently go to grab my gun and miss, or grab my rifle from the chest holster by mistake. Also, nothing has any sense of weight to it. Guns feel like they're made of Styrofoam, while enemies crumple like wet cardboard when shot. The result is that combat is more absurd than it is thrilling, with you pole-axing a guard because you were trying to grab your pistol and accidentally chucked your assault-rifle at their head. 
With more polished combat and more precision in the level design, Espire 1 would be a decent chunk of VR stealth. It's campaign lasts about six hours, with around twenty short challenge missions on top of that. As it stands, however, it's just a little too fiddly in execution for me to sneakily slip it a wholehearted recommendation.

Espire 1's VR stealth is brimming with neat ideas, but the end product is slightly less than the sum of its parts.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm still waiting patiently for the day when the modding community figures out how to get airplanes and helicopters into Red Dead Redemption 2, but until then this hot air balloon mod by Krank will have to do. Once installed you can conjure up a balloon wherever you are and fly it around freely, getting some amazing bird's eye views of Red Dead's sprawling slice of the Wild West.
The balloon moves way faster than it realistically should. Don't expect to find an accurate simulation of a hot air balloon here. But it's a thrill being able to float around that massive world without being stuck on the back of a horse. The latest version of the mod added inertia and smoother controls, and it even has controller support if you're playing Red Dead with a gamepad.
Installing the mod is as simple as dropping a file into your game directory. Just make sure you have Script Hook RDR2 otherwise it won't work. To spawn a balloon, hit F8 and you're ready to fly. And don't forget to check out our list of the best Red Dead Redemption 2 mods for more ways to transform the game. Just don't go online with mods installed or you might get banned.

“We decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future. This decision will not in any way affect the release and development of GAEA’s Asia-specific version of Legends, which is operated separately, but will inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward,” Bethesda wrote in an update on Reddit.
The game will remain playable — and supported — on all available platforms, Bethesda also confirmed.
“Until then, you can still download and play Legends on all existing platforms and compete online as well as in the single-player modes.

Studio Sparkypants Studios took over development duties on Legends from Dire Wolf back in 2018; it’s unclear how this business decision impacts the studio.
The Elder Scrolls: Legends is currently available on Windows PC, Mac, iOS and Android.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bethesda has recently announced on Reddit that development on their Elder Scrolls themed card title Elder Scrolls Legends is currently on hold for the foreseeable future. The team will still continue to support the game, but planned updates and expansions have been scrapped. It is not clear what this means for the console versions. A Nintendo Switch version was announced at E3 2018 so we shall have to wait and see whether it sees the light of day.
“We would like to provide an update on Legends in regard to new content. Our previous roadmap indicated we would be releasing one more set this year. We decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future. This decision will not in any way affect the release and development of GAEA’s Asia-specific version of Legends, which is operated separately, but will inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward.

We will continue to provide ongoing maintenance support.
To thank you all for supporting Legends these past few years, and for continuing to play with us, we are giving away The Tamriel Collection – an assortment of new, three-attribute cards and more – to all players for free upon their next login. We are immensely grateful to work on The Elder Scrolls: Legends, to have you as a community, and we sincerely appreciate the love and support you’ve given us.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: December 9, 2019 7:36:32 pm
WhatsApp will now support call waiting on Android and the latest update brings this feature.
WhatsApp on Android is now getting the much awaited and useful call waiting feature. The call waiting feature was earlier added to the iOS version of the app, back in November this year. On Android, the WhatsApp call waiting feature has rolled out to both the stable and beta versions of the app. The beta version 2.19.358 and stable versions 2.19.352 and 2.19.357 both get the call waiting feature, according to the information on Google Play Store.
The Call Waiting feature as the name suggests will let users decide whether they want to accept or end an incoming WhatsApp call, while in the middle of another one with someone else. Earlier, WhatsApp would automatically disconnect the incoming WhatsApp call, but now the user interface shows an alert about the other call.
Users have the option of declining the incoming call altogether or to End & Accept, which would be accepting the new incoming call. This will end the earlier call. But this is not the same as call holding that we get on regular telecom lines. WhatsApp does not allow two users to be on the same line at the same time like it is possible on a regular telecom call.
The Play Store changelog for WhatsApp also mentions the new group privacy settings feature, which lets users limit who can add them to a group. It also mentions the fingerprint unlock support for WhatsApp, which means the app cannot be opened by anyone else other than the authorised user.
Update your WhatsApp on Android to the versions mentioned above. APK mirror files of the same are also available online. Once you have updated, the WhatsApp calling waiting is activated automatically, you don’t need to do anything extra.
Once the feature is activated, if you are in the middle of a WhatsApp call, and another call comes, you will be shown two options. The caller’s name will flash with the options Decline or End& Accept as the two options. The same can be seen in the photo we have used above.
Decline is shown in red, which means you are rejecting the incoming call. If you choose End&Accept, then the ongoing call is disconnected and the new incoming call is connected. As noted earlier, WhatsApp does not put the earlier call on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Airtel, Vodafone-Idea remove limit on calls to other networks: Here’s what it means</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: December 9, 2019 7:06:37 pm
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea have both removed the limit on off-net calls or calls outside their network, and put back unlimited calling on their plans.
Earlier this month, both Airtel and Vodafone-Idea introduced their new prepaid plans, which were priced higher than previous ones, and also introduced restrictions on calls to other networks. While calls made within their networks would remain unlimited, both Airtel and Vodafone-Idea had added a Fair Usage Policy (FUP) on calls to other networks or ‘off-net’ calls. Now they have removed the FUP on off-net calls, and once again made their packs unlimited, given the daily data benefits and unlimited calls.
Airtel tweeted, “We heard you! And we are making the change. From tomorrow, enjoy unlimited calling to any network in India with all our unlimited plans. No conditions apply.” Vodafone also tweeted, “Enjoy free unlimited calls to everyone. More reasons for you to rejoice for being on your favourite network.”
For users, this is a win-win. While the prices of prepaid packs have increased overall, the FUP limit on calls to other networks has been removed. This FUP limit meant that if you crossed a certain number of minutes for calls to other networks, you would be charged extra, at the rate of 6 paisa per minutes.
So calls from Vodafone to Vodafone were free, but calls from Vodafone to Airtel, while technically free had a condition attached to them. Plans under Rs 300 were offering 1,000 minutes worth off-net calls from both Airtel and Vodafone. More expensive plans with 84 days validity had higher FUP on calling of 3000 minutes.
For users, this would resulted in some confusion with regards to which calls were free, and which calls would eventually get charged. Now that both Airtel and Vodafone have removed the limit, the prepaid plans go back to unlimited calling as it was offered earlier.
Bharti Airtel also introduced three new unlimited prepaid plans.
Airtel tweeted out a list of three new unlimited calling plans with FUP removed. Two of these plans come with 56 days validity. The first plan of Rs 219 comes with unlimited calls, 1GB data per day, 100 SMS per day. The pack is valid for 28 days, and comes with free Airtel Xstream app, Wynk music and HelloTunes access.
Airtel’s other pack is Rs 399 which has a validity of 56 days, and comes with 1.5GB data per day, unlimited calling to all networks, 100 daily SMS and free Airtel Xstream app, Wynk music and HelloTunes access.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vivo V17 review: Good cameras, slick design but competition is tough</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written by Sneha Saha | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:54:43 pm
Vivo V17 review: The phone comes with a 48MP quad camera and a 32MP front selfie camera. Here’s what we thought of its performance. (Image source: Sneha Saha/Indian Express)
With the V17 Pro, Vivo set a new benchmark in smartphone photography thanks to its six cameras. The Vivo V17 Pro set itself up as a phone for camera enthusiasts. And that seems to be the USP all other Vivo phones too are playing on, including the just-announced Vivo V17.
The V17 Pro introduced a dual selfie pop-up camera setup. In fact, the V17 Pro is still the only phone to come with such a camera technology. With the V17, Vivo takes inspiration from Samsung and shifts to a punch-hole camera.
In addition to the front camera design, Vivo has also changed the look of the rear camera setup compared to the V17 Pro. The V17 includes a rectangular camera moduled aligned vertically on the top left corner of the back. The module includes all the four cameras and LED flash. The Vivo V17 looks much better than the V17 Pro which was a bit bulky. The Vivo V17 is extremely lightweight, despite the 4500 mAh battery inside. The phone has the right size and that makes it very easy to use it with just one hand which was difficult with the Pro.

Vivo V17 price in India: Rs 22,990
Vivo V17 specifications: 6.44-inches Super AMOLED display | Snapdragon 675 processor | 8GB RAM | 128GB internal storage | 4500mAh battery with 18W fast charging | 48MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide camera + 2MP macro camera + 2MP depth sensor | 32MP selfie camera | FunTouch 9.2 OS based on Android 9 Pie.
Camera is one of the most important aspects of the Vivo V17, so let’s start with that. The first thing I noticed was that the V17’s camera app was slightly cluttered with too many options on one screen. This often confuses users on which camera mode to try. This is actually a problem with Vivo’s custom skin FunTouchOS 9 that runs on the V17.

I used the phone to click pictures in almost all lighting situations from bright sunlight to low-light. Pictures shot in bright daylight show good amount of details and decent colours. I like the fact that this Vivo phone doesn’t pop the colours too much and captures the right colour-shade, almost. The ultra-wide shots clicked with the phone also look decent, but often miss out on details. The portrait shots clicked with the V17 also turn out to be good, but I would have liked the edges to be slightly more sharp.
The two areas where I believe the Vivo V17’s camera does a great job are with macro and low-light. Almost every picture clicked with Super Macro camera mode showed great details and good colours. The macro mode works best in good lighting conditions.

I have also clicked numerous low-light pictures with the V17 and all of them turned out impressive. The Night camera mode of the V17 captures better details and colours in low-light conditions compared to the default photo mode. The good news is that V17 brings night mode not just for back camera but also for the front and it also works pretty well. The Vivo V17 also clicks great selfies in situations with good light.
The V17 is undoubtedly one of the best-looking Vivo phones of 2019. It looks unique and that is mostly due to different rear camera design and the punch-hole screen on the front. For the first time Vivo opts for a rectangular (vertically) camera module and this adds to the overall design of the phone. Despite the four cameras, the back panel of the V17 doesn’t look cluttered which is great. The smartphone overall sports a clean design. The punch-hole on the front is small, which doesn’t make it look odd. It is much smaller than the camera hole on Samsung Galaxy M40 and Galaxy S10 series.
I loved watching movies and YouTube videos on the V17 thanks to the big, bezel-less AMOLED screen that produces punchy colours and offers great viewing angles in almost every scenario. The screen of the phone gets pretty bright even under the scorching Delhi sun. Keeping the brightness level of the phone to around 60 – 70 per cent in daylight worked pretty well for me while in indoors brightness level at 30 per cent approx seemed adequate.
Under the screen of the phone, there’s a fingerprint sensor that works like a breeze. The face unlock system also unlocks the phone in just a blink of an eye.

The Vivo-Qualcomm partnership for Snapdragon 675 chipset appears to be never-ending. The Vivo’s V15 Pro and V17 Pro and now the V17 are all powered by the same processor. So, if specs matter to you then the Vivo V17 will seem outdated in terms of hardware as it uses a processor that is over a year old. In reality, however, the V17 handles day-to-day tasks very well with no stutters.
I played games like Asphalt 9, Temple Run on the Vivo V17 and both of them worked pretty well for me with no frame drops. At no point did the phone lag. The ultra game mode enhances the overall gaming experience as it blocks calls and notifications during an on-going match. The Vivo V17 also manages to multitask very well, but sometimes too many apps running in the background slowed down the phone slightly. Some of the apps also took some time to open in a few instances.

The phone runs FunTouch 9 OS based on Android 9 Pie, which brings with it lots of bloatware. Software is one area Vivo should make quick changes as FunTouch is too cluttered. There are several third-party apps pre-installed, some can be deleted others can’t. FunTouch also brings along some nifty features like dark-more and always-on display.
Vivo V17 easily lasts more than a day on a single charge. The phone also charges pretty quickly. The V17 comes with 18W fast charger inside the box and it takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge. It is also good to see that Vivo has finally ditched microUSB and made Type C port standard for all its premium phones.
At this price, the Vivo V17 offers great value. The phone sports a clean design and looks unique. It captures great pictures in almost all situations and does a great job with macro and low-light shots. It offers a long-lasting battery life and supports fast charging support inside the box. The only area where I believe Vivo V17 could have been slightly better is hardware.
I wish the phone could have used a Snapdragon 712 or the newer 730 similar to other phones available at this price like the Redmi K20 Pro and Realme XT. As I mentioned, the existing Snapdragon 675 processor does a good job, but a new chipset could have offered a smoother experience and future-proof the device for users.
Should you buy the Vivo V17? Well, although there are some of the most popular phones like Redmi K20 Pro and Realme XT available at this price point I believe the Vivo V17 stands strong against the competition as it offers pretty good value for the money.

The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
Apple has acknowledged the popping sound issues on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The tech giant says the popping sound coming from the speakers of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a software issue, according to a memo obtained by MacRumors. The company says it will roll out a fix through a software update in the near future. The company advises its Authorised Service providers not to repair or replace the affected MacBook Pros due to it.
As reported by MacRumors, users have taken to Apple Support Communities and Reddit to raise their voice about the popping sound issues. Multiple users have reported hearing popping or clicking sounds coming from the speakers when playing audio or video. The popping sound usually occurs after a user has stopped playing a video or audio. One user has suggested that the issue could be related to Final Cut Pro X. It is unclear when Apple plans to fix the issue, but Apple is currently working on it.
Another issue that has surfaced is slow-response time from the 16-inch MacBook Pro wide-colour display. This issue results in a “ghosting” when scrolling text.

Just last month, Apple released a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that succeeded the original 15-inch MacBook Pro, which has now been permanently discontinued. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is pitched as a premium notebook designed to meet the expectations of video editors, musicians, artists, etc. The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
With the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has made a number of changes to make the new computer standout. Perhaps the most visible change comes in the form of a redesigned keyboard that ditches the flat “butterfly” keyboard, as well as a new thermal architecture. Apple has also improved battery life on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.

Vivo V17 with 48MP quad camera, punch-hole display launched in India: Here are details on price, specifications and sale offers. (Image source: Sneha Saha/Indian Express)
Vivo V17, the company’s latest mid-range smartphone with focus on the camera has just been announced for the Indian market. Vivo V17 is a slightly more affordable version of the earlier V17 Pro, which had a similar camera setup at the back. The new phone will go on sale starting December 17, 2019. The company states that V17 has been manufactured at their Greater Noida facility in India.
Vivo V17 comes in only 8GB RAM + 128GB storage option. It will be sold in two colours: Midnight Ocean and Glacier Ice. The price of the Vivo V17 is Rs 22,990. Pre-orders are open from today in offline stores and on vivo’s own estore. The official sale starts December 17, 2019. It will also be sold on Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm mall, Tatacliq and the Bajaj Finserv EMI Store and across all partner retail stores.
Vivo has announced a slew of offers on the purchase of vivo V17, which come with cashback and data benefit. For offline buyers, vivo V17 will come with 5 per cent cashback for those using the HDFC Bank Credit Card for regular transactions or using the credit/debit card for EMI transactions.
There’s also 5 per cent cashback with ICICI Band Credit Card and Debit Card EMI transactions as well as for Axis Bank and for IDFC First Bank & HDBFS paper finance on down payment schemes. All these offers are valid till December 31, 2019. Data benefits for those buying offline will come from Reliance Jio, which will be worth Rs 12,000.
For online customers, there is 5 per cent cashback on prepaid offers, No Cost EMI up to 12 months and the Jio offer of Rs 12,000 data benefits also continues.

Vivo V17 sports a 6.44-inch full HD+ (2400×1080) resolution display, which is an SAMOLED screen with a 20:9 aspect ratio. Vivo V17 has a punch hole display on the front. The company claims the screen can filter out 42 per cent of blue light and comes with anti-flicker technology to protect eyes in the dark. It comes with Schott Xensation UP display protection on top.
Like the vivo V17 Pro, this phone continues to run the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 octa-core processor. We have also seen this processor on older devices like Redmi Note 7 Pro. The phone has a 4500 mAh battery, which comes with the company’s own Dual-Engine Fast Charging technology, though vivo has not specified how quickly it recharges the phone. It comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and has Type-C USB port at the bottom for charging.
The camera on the vivo V17 continues with the quad or four sensor setup at the back. The main camera is 48MP, then there’s an 8MP super-wide angle camera, followed by a 2MP macro camera and 2MP bokeh camera. Other camera features are noise reduction, Super Night for low-light photography, and the phone uses the company’s own portrait algorithm.  The front camera is 32MP.
The device also sports an in-display fingerprint sensor, which features a 3P lens supported by vivo’s intelligent algorithm. On the software front, it also comes with an optimised Game mode, and runs Android Pie 9  based on the company’s own FunTouch OS 9.2 on top. Dimensions of the vivo V17 are 159.01×74.17×8.54mm and it weighs 176 grams.

More than two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed to all Indians. With the Cabinet clearing a data protection bill this past week, the Government of India is making progress on delivering on that promise. Since that judgment, Indians have faced numerous threats to their privacy from the Automated Facial Recognition System, mandatory FastTag car registration, and continuing breaches of Aadhaar demographic data.
Yet, the process to develop a data protection law has been slow and opaque, and the rumours coming out of the government are not encouraging that the bill, which will likely be introduced next week, will deliver the privacy protections that Indians need and deserve. It is vital that the Parliament’s Standing Committee on IT have a chance to review the law and recommend any changes needed to ensure that the privacy of Indian citizens is protected.
Since the Justice BN Srikrishna committee draft was released in 2018, there have been multiple consultations conducted by the IT Ministry, but the public is yet to see a new draft in over 18 months. Thanks to this build up, the changes between the 2018 draft and the upcoming law will be closely studied to measure the extent to which the government has responded to the industry and civil society calls for improving the law.
As details of the final bill begin to leak out, not all of the signs are encouraging. While the public still has yet to see the actual text of the bill, several government sources have been cited detailing new provisions which would undermine, not protect, Indians’ privacy. For example, an official was quoted as saying that social media companies will have to verify the identities of social media users to fight fake news.
They also said that the bill will require the forced transfer of non-personal data to the government. These are serious threats to privacy, which should be carefully reviewed by the Standing Committee on IT of the Parliament.
Explained: The issues, debate around Data Protection Bill
If rumours are to be believed, the bill contains a provision requiring social media companies to provide an option for users to verify their identities using Know Your Customer (KYC) like processes and requires the companies report accounts that choose to opt-out of this verification to the government. People should not be reported to the government for wanting to protect their privacy. There are many reasons why someone would want to use a pseudonym that have nothing to do with fake news — for example, a woman who doesn’t want her stalker to find her online posts or location.
Social media companies can just as easily also exploit the sensitive data harvested from the government IDs submitted for such verification to target and profile users. Both Facebook and Twitter have been heavily criticised for using phone numbers submitted by users for two factor authentication (a security measure) to target ads on its platforms.
Apart from harming user privacy, this will also increase the risk from data breaches and further entrench large players in the social media space who can afford to build and maintain such systems. There is no evidence to suggest that such moves will help in fighting fake news works in any form. The government is also considering tackling the issue of misinformation through amendments to India’s intermediary liability regime, which is a better venue to debate issues of content regulation.
Another concerning provision is the rumoured mandatory sharing of non-personal data for public policy and planning with the government. Allowing the government to force companies to transfer non-personal data raises serious intellectual property concerns, and can still threaten users even if they’re not individually identified. For example, would we want the government knowing which housing colonies in a city have a propensity to buy pro-LGBTQIA+ posters, books about a specific caste, or religious objects? This data may not contain any identifying information about a specific individual but can be used by malicious actors with disastrous consequences.
The law should retain its focus on protecting personal data and not attempt to solve everything from misinformation to data sharing concerns in one law. This will lead to neither of these problems being solved in a sustainable way while actively harming the privacy of Indian users, defeating the entire point of this legislation.
The details on how the law implements these provisions and accounts for other concerns such as its applicability to the government’s use of data will only be clear once the law is made public. We urge the Standing Committee to properly review the bill and the Government to implement recommendations to ensure the final law is an example to the world.

OnePlus TV is finally getting the official Netflix app.
If you own a OnePlus TV and live in India, you can now stream Netflix’s hit shows like Stanger Things and The Crown natively on the device. In a blog post over the official OnePlus Forums, OnePlus TV Software PM, Steven X, confirmed the official Netflix app is now available on a 55-inch QLED screen and a Pro model. While a number of apps were present at the launch, the exclusion of Netflix was seen as a bummer. OnePlus promised that Netflix will be added sometime in October and now it has delivered on that promise.
The latest software update comes with the build number V1.8.0T1911211115 and is rolling out to both OnePlus 55 Q1Pro and OnePlis 55Q1. The update is being released in batches, so it could take some time to show up on your TV. Beyond the Netflix support, the software update also fixes a number of issues, which are listed below:
*Added setting for directly entering recent “Input Source” at startup*Optimized volume adjustment experience to increase or decrease audio volume more comfortable*Pressing volume up and down buttons together to mute the TV*Remote low battery and charging status notification on TV*Optimized PQ video pinkish issue

It is available in two versions – Q1 and Q1 Pro, one with the soundbar and one without. he OnePlus TV offers a 55-inch QLED panel and 4K resolution. The Android TV-powered smart TV brings Dolby Atmos as well as Dolby Vision. During the launch event held in India, OnePlus co-founder and CEO Pete Lau said that the idea behind the OnePlus TV was to bring the smartphone and TV closer.
OnePlus TV competes with Samsung’s high-end QLED TVs and LG’s OLED TVs. At the moment, OnePlus TV is limited to India.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what may be the oddest news this week, Auction house RR Auction has just sold a floppy disk with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' signature for a whopping $84,000. The floppy disk is dated to about 1988 and contains Macintosh System Tools 6.0 software. 
RELATED: STAR WARS FAN-FAVORITE R2-D2 SELLS FOR $2.76 MILLION AT AUCTION
The reason it went for that much, claims the auction house, is that Jobs rarely gave out his signature. "A hugely desirable format for Jobs's seldom-seen autograph—known as a reluctant signer, he often declined to comply with the requests of collectors," reads RR Auction's item description.
The firm also said the disk was in "fine condition, with slight brushing to the ink." "As a piece of Apple's iconic Mac OS software, boasting Jobs's elegantly stylish lowercase signature, this is a museum-quality piece of computing history," further reads the posting.
Initially, the item was estimated to have a value of just $7,500. This is not the first of Jobs' items to sell for an exorbitant amount.
Last August, a "Toy Story" movie poster signed by Jobs went up for auction at of $25,000. In addition, a commemorative plaque and a copy of Mac world both with the late CEO's signature went up for auction at $15,000 and $10,000 respectively.
Finally, last but definitely not least, last year, a job application by the entrepreneur written in 1973 sold for a mind-boggling $174,000. What do you think about these items? Are they a waste of money or valuable mementos meant to be cherished?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rest of the World News
Written By Riya Baibhawi | Mumbai | Updated On: December 09, 2019 17:54 IST
An auction house in US, RR Auction has sold a floppy disk signed by the late Apple co-founder for $84,000. The floppy disk has a copy of Macintosh system tools version 6.0. On the disk’s label is the signature of  Steve jobs with a black felt pen.
RR Auction’s website states that the floppy disk is in fine condition with slight brushing to the ink and part of the item description reads that it is a hugely desirable format for Jobs' seldom-seen autograph. Jobs is remembered as a reluctant signer and he often declined to comply with the requests of collectors making the Apple co-founder’s signature a collector’s item.

According to 2018 Paul Fraser Collectibles Autograph index, it was revealed that Jobs’ signature was more than $50,000 making it one of the most expensive autographs in the world. In September earlier this year, a poster for the original Toy Story signed by jobs sold for over $30,000 by Nate D Sanders Auctions. Jobs was the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, whose first production was Toy story. The movie turned out to be a major hit. Last year, a job application was written by him in 1973 sold for $1,74,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Jaguar F-Type SVR Rendering Imagines A Car We Won’t Get</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this month, the Jaguar F-Type received a noticeable facelift with a smoother design, new front and rear fascias, and other, subtler changes. Along with the new looks, came some trim rejiggering, which gave the F-Type R the SVR’s 575-horsepower (429-kilowatt) V8. Sadly, the top-tier SVR will no longer available, leaving us with this rendering of an updated 2021 F-Type SVR.
The 2021 Jaguar F-Type SVR rendering from Aksyonov Nikita is subtle while capturing all the details we’d expect to see if the top-tier trim ever makes a return. The rendering retains much of the car’s svelte shape and smooth lines. The SVR additions are minor, enhancing the coupe’s look with enough aggressiveness to draw the gaze of a trained eye, but not enough to look outlandish.
The most ostentatious aspect is the wing, but even it feels diminutive. The SVR rendering also features plenty of carbon fiber with accents up front and side skirts. At the rear, there’s a massive carbon fiber rear diffuser with equally enormous quad exhaust tips. If the wing and badging didn’t give away the F-Type’s performance prowess, the exhaust certainly does.
The lack of changes made to the F-Type SVR compared to the standard F-Type is a testament to the F-Type’s well-styled appearance. It’s pleasing to look at, exuding power and performance without the need to scream, “Look at me, please!”
While it is upsetting we won’t get a new SVR – at least anytime soon as the current SVR didn’t debut until three years after the F-Type – we are thankful Jaguar will continue to use the mill in the F-Type R. It’ll help rocket the car to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) in 3.5 seconds while top speed is electronically limited to 186 mph (299 kph). Those are impressive numbers that have us imagining what a new SVR could achieve.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In addition to selling factory-spec vehicles, Long McArthur Ford in Salina, Kansas, also builds its own performance versions of the Blue Oval's products, and the latest one is the F-250 Baja 1000. The edition's name comes from these pickups boasting at least 1,000 pound-feet of torque.
The Baja 1000 starts as a 2019 F-250 in the XL trim and the four-door Crew Cab body. The 6.7-liter turbodiesel V8 gets a cold-air intake and a tune to boost the output. Each truck comes with an individual dyno graph showing how the modifications affect it. Long McArthur guarantees them to make at least 1,000 pound-feet at the crank, but one of them makes an estimated 1,060 lb-ft (1,437 Newton-meters).

It's worth noting that if you want so much torque but buying a vehicle from Kansas isn't an option, then the 2020 model year of the F-250 comes with an updated version of the 6.7-liter turbodiesel that now produces 475 horsepower (354 kilowatts) and 1,050 lb-ft (1,423 Nm) from the factory.
Long McArthur fits an upgraded suspension with a 2.5-inch lift, adjustable traction bar, and Fox 2.0 shocks. The pickup rides on 20-inch wheels and 35-inch BF Goodrich 35-inch all-terrain tires.
The body receives new bumpers with Baja 1000 cut into them, LED fog lights in front, and rear wheel-well liners for extra protection when off-roading. A large graphic splashes across the side of the body. A Rhino Pro spray-in bedliner protects the cargo area. Smaller touches include illuminated trim on the front fenders, black grille, and front window tint.
On the inside, the XL trim generally has cloth upholstery, but Long McArthur Ford refits the cabin with leather-trimmed seats. The company also uses this opportunity to add heating functionality to both rows.
Long McArthur Ford's site currently shows four Baja 1000 trucks for sale, and all of them retail for $69,990. If the red one in this video isn't your style, the showroom also has the pickups in white, black, and dark blue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's Holden Colorado Pickup Spied Testing In Michigan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General Motors has a modest facelift in the works for its midsize Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck in the U.S. market. The truck isn’t just sold in America, however, and that means other regions should get an updated version as well. Ironically, this right-hand-drive Colorado believed to be a Holden model destined for Australia was recently spotted in southeast Michigan, near GM’s Milford Proving Grounds.

It’s the first Holden Colorado sighting we’ve had, and it’s similar to our previous U.S. market encounter in that the changes will be fairly small. The only camouflage on this prototype is at the front, hiding a new front fascia and possible changes to the hood to match the fresh face. The sides and rear – right down to the taillights – look identical to the current model. That’s not to say some updated lights couldn’t be swapped in later, but if that’s the case, they will slot into the Colorado’s current location without modification.
As for what’s beneath the camouflage wrap, a new upper and lower grille with updated fog lamp housings appear to be the primary differences. Headlights are identical to the current model, which is the exact same trend we saw on the U.S.-spec Colorado and GMC Canyon spy shots from earlier in the year. Those trucks will sport larger grilles in the states to closer resemble their full-size counterparts. Unless there’s more grille hiding beneath the camo coverings down low, it appears the bigger-is-better trend won’t make it to Australia.
Powertrain options are expected to remain the same. Interior layout should also be more or less identical, though some added tech could accompany the facelift. We’re expecting to see the tweaked Colorado debut in the states early-to-mid next year as a 2021 model, and our sources say Holden’s version will likely appear around the same time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Volvo S90 sedan, V90 wagon, and V90 Cross Country have styling updates on the way, and these photos catch all three of them conducting cold-weather testing in Sweden. Judging by these shots and earlier pictures, the company doesn't intend to make extensive exterior styling tweaks for this refresh.
Volvo's camouflage puts tiny coverings over sections of the lower bumpers. There's also tape around the front splitter. The pieces have a horizontal layout that might make the vehicles look wider when the camouflage comes off. In addition, the grille spokes have a more concave shape.

Snow covers the back of these vehicles, which conceals some of the changes. If you look very closely, tape is visible on the lower part of the bumper near the exhausts. Volvo also conceals sections of the taillights, which indicates design tweaks for them, too.
So far, the styling revisions for the interior are a mystery. Infotainment system upgrades seem like practically a certainty, though. Look for Volvo also to introduce its latest active safety tech.
Powertrain tweaks are also unknown. An array of mild-hybrid and plug-in powertrains should still be available. Volvo is currently introducing what the company says is its final generation of diesel powerplants, so look for these to be available, too.
Given how small these changes are, we don't expect Volvo to wait very long before debuting the first of the refreshed models. The company might have a staggered unveiling for the sedan and wagon to maintain interest in the improvements among buyers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">VW Caddy Spied Playing In The Snow Again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vans may not garner much interest from hardcore car enthusiasts, but their uncompromised utility should not go overlooked. Volkswagen understands this as it continues to develop a new generation of VW Caddy vans, which are in desperate need of an overhaul. The current model arrived in 2003 with facelifts in 2010 and 2015, but the model still rides on old bones – and that doesn’t jive with the Volkswagen of 2019.  
The new Caddy will ride on VW’s MBQ platform that underpins many of the company’s latest models. While spy photos show the regular-sized Caddy, there should be a longer Maxi version, though Volkswagen is rumored to integrate the Caddy into the VW T7 lineup as the T7 Life Caddy. It’ll join the T7 Multivan while the T7 Family will replace the Sharan. 
While VW has to keep the van’s boxy proportions – it wouldn’t be a van otherwise – the automaker is giving it modern looks. The front end appears a bit longer, and more car-like than before with the classic closed grille. The sliding doors return while the rear gets reworked. The small, square taillights are gone, replaced by units that appear to reach from the beltline to the roof.  
The Caddy’s move to VW’s MBQ platform will also help with smarter packaging, optimizing interior cargo, and passenger space. The platform also allows VW to easily integrate new, alternative powertrains into the vehicle, such as a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, which should help the van meet ever-tightening European emissions standards.  
The Volkswagen Caddy could debut in the second half of next year get pushed to the first quarter of 2021 before going on sale that year. Once the Caddy is out, Volkswagen will then replace the Sharan with the T7 Family the following year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar I-Pace Gets 12 More Miles Of Range From New Software Update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The rumors are true, and Jaguar I-Pace owners can soon visit their local dealer for a free update to boost the electric vehicle's range. The improved software can add up to 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the crossover range.
Jaguar says that the tweaks include optimizations to the battery management, thermal systems, and all-wheel drive torque improvements. The regenerative braking also harvests more energy at low speeds, and the range calculation on the instrument panel is more accurate than before. In an example of race cars improving road-going models, the company says that technical knowhow from the I-Pace eTrophy series is the major contributor to making these upgrades.

"The Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy has generated a huge amount of data for us to analyze and those marginal gains, derived from competition on the track, are now being applied to customers’ cars to further enhance their driving experience," said Stephen Boulter, I-Pace Vehicle Engineering Manager, in the software update's announcement.
The 2020 I-Pace has an EPA-estimated range of 234 miles (377 kilometers) before this update. Jag notes that is upgrade doesn't change that figure. However, the company's testing shows the tweaked software provides an eight percent boost in range "dependent on usage."
As an extra bonus, this software upgrade also enhances the I-Pace's ability to get over-the-air updates in the future by making more of the vehicle's electronic modules available for improvements.
Jaguar seems serious about eventually adding a high-performance version of the I-Pace to the lineup, and it would likely take significant inspiration from the eTrophy racer. Expect the model to have a boost in output and possibly a larger battery to keep the range up. Unfortunately, the vehicle could still be years away because the SVO division is working on other projects.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mercedes EQA Spied With Production Body And Lights</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just a few hours ago, we shared the first spy photos with an almost uncamouflaged prototype of the new Mercedes-Benz GLA. Now, we can take a closer look at its all-electric version, tentatively called the EQA, which has been spotted testing on public roads in Scandinavia.
The EV high-riding model will ride on the MFA II platform, which will be shared with the combustion-powered GLA. This easily explains the similarities in the overall shape between the two cars. From the short overhangs at the back and up front to the gently sloping roofline at the back, everything seems to be almost identical. Still, unique trim and lighting ornaments should be installed on the EV.

It’s a completely different story underneath the skin, however. Whereas the GLA is expected to launch with a range of turbocharged combustion engines, the EQA will use a purely electric powertrain with an estimated maximum range at a single charge of 298 miles (480 kilometers). Not much else is known at the moment but expect to see several different variants depending on the power output, range, and price. An AWD model could also happen.
Mercedes has plans to launch no fewer than 10 all-electric models on the market by 2025, and the EQ A is one of the many new EVs we should see from the Stuttgart-based company in the next 12 to 24 months. These also include the EQB and EQS models, with the latter expected to take the crown as the brand’s EV flagship offering.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Land Rover Defender By Overfinch Is A Green Gem With Massive Engine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's a new generation of the Land Rover Defender getting headlines, but Overfinch continues to give attention to the original. The tuner's latest project is a one-off soft top pickup in a vivid shade of emerald green and a big engine under the hood.
Power receives a major upgrade from a General-Motors-sourced 6.2-liter V8. Overfinch doesn't outline the output, but these engines are famous for their easy tunability. The company also adds a stainless steel exhaust and carbon fiber engine cover. The output runs through an automatic gearbox and four-wheel-drive system.
While the vehicle is still capable of going off-road, Overfinch put a greater emphasis on luxury for this build. Using Defender 90 as the starting point, the company removed the second row's bench seat and replaced it with a teak cargo bed. For keeping things secure, there's a lockable storage box. A full-size spare tire has a special spot back there, too.
The occupants in front sit in Recaro sport seats that have emerald green and tan leather upholstery. The hides also cover the dashboard and steering wheel. The door handles, gearshift, handbrake, pedals, and instrument dials are chrome with a knurled finish.
Overfinch makes a few exterior tweaks, including fitting a custom hood with a sculpted power bulge. The company also fits a set of 18-inch wheels with green details that match the body's color. A removable soft top panel clips onto the roll bars to offer a little overhead protection.
A client commissioned Overfinch to build this vehicle. There's no info on its price, but with enough money, the company would surely create another if a buyer comes along.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat has a new feature that will let you take a selfie and use the resulting image to put your face into videos and gifs -- deepfake style. The new feature is called Snapchat Cameos, and it's viewed as an alternative to Bitmoji for conveying feelings in a Snapchat message.
Snapchat has stated that Cameo is currently a limited availability product that is in testing. For now, Cameos is said to be available in some limited international markets; however, a date for international rollout has been announced. The global launch of Cameos will happen on December 18 for iOS and Android.
Using Cameos sounds simple enough, requiring users to take a selfie to show the app what you look like. Users can then choose male or female body types. Once those steps are done, Cameo is in the Bitmoji button on the Snapchat messaging keyboard.
Snapchat has 150 short looping video clips (which also feature sounds) that users can place their face into. The Cameo app will stretch and move the face cribbed from the selfie you used in the setup portion to fit the user's face onto the video and make it move. A multi-friend Cameo feature is offered that will allow users to have their face in videos with friends.
Multiple categories will be offered that can be searched for videos to suit what message the user wants to convey. In addition, the selfie used to generate the videos can be changed whenever you want, and cameos can be saved to the camera roll for sharing elsewhere. The last time we talked about Snapchat was when it rolled out the third-generation of its Spectacles last summer that offer a pair of integrated HD cameras.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A more realistic Bitmoji? Snapchat is rolling out a tool called Cameo that uses deepfake technology</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SnapChat is adding a feature that basically allows you to deepfake yourself into a video or GIF for fun.
The feature was first spotted by Snapchat users in France who received a test version of the tool over the weekend. The latest addition to the app is called Cameo, Snapchat said in a press release Monday.
"With Cameos, you become the star of short, looping videos that you can customize with your own face," Snapchat said. "They're great for striking up new conversations or making responses to your friends personal, dynamic and fun."
Based on screen captures posted by people on Twitter, Cameo uses your selfie to plaster your face on a digitized body. The feature has a similar look and application to Bitmoji, except more realistic. It's rolling out globally on Dec.18 with over 150 variations to choose from.
Cameo will be embedded in the Chat sticker bar once the new feature is live in the U.S. You get to choose the body you'd like for your face to appear on, and Snapchat will use AI to manipulate your face into displaying different emotions and expressions.
If your friends set up Cameo, you'll see options that feature the two of you together. And, many can include your own text.
Deepfake technology would be a relatively new frontier for the app, though it would further differentiate Snapchat from its rivals Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. The technology, which has been used to transpose celebrities into pornographic videos, has come under criticism because it could be used to maliciously produce fake political videos.
Still, Snapchat has been hard at work developing new filters and add-ons to keep the platform interesting for teens and young adults who are constantly on the hunt for new, creative ways to interact with peers.
In November, Snapchat picked up where the wildly popular Face App left off by rolling out a tool that tries to show you what you look like at every phase of life. It's called Time Machine, and it includes a slider you can drag across your screen to watch the years add up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to clear your Google search history on your Android phone or tablet, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What you search for on your Android phone or tablet is your own private business, but if someone were to go through your Google search history on your device, that private stuff could become all too public. That’s the main reason you should regularly clear your Google search history on your Android, but it’s not the only reason.
Past Google searches can impact the results you get in future searches, which means that the results Google gives you could be influenced by keywords you searched in the past. For example, say you had an assignment about the Civil War, but now that it’s submitted your interest in the 1860s has faded – until you clear your search history, those dozens of Civil War-centric search queries will still influence your Google results here in the 21st century.
Clearing search history on an Android device is a quick and easy process, so don’t skip it.
1. Launch the Google Chrome app and check to make sure you are logged into your account.
2. Tap the three little dots at the top-right corner of the screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to clear your Google search history on your Android phone or tablet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What you search for on your Android phone or tablet is your own private business, but if someone were to go through your Google search history on your device, that private stuff could become all too public. That’s the main reason you should regularly clear your Google search history on your Android, but it’s not the only reason.
Past Google searches can impact the results you get in future searches, which means that the results Google gives you could be influenced by keywords you searched in the past. For example, say you had an assignment about the Civil War, but now that it’s submitted your interest in the 1860s has faded – until you clear your search history, those dozens of Civil War-centric search queries will still influence your Google results here in the 21st century.
Clearing search history on an Android device is a quick and easy process, so don’t skip it.
1. Launch the Google Chrome app and check to make sure you are logged into your account.
2. Tap the three little dots at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Tap on “History” in the drop-down menu.
4. Tap “CLEAR BROWSING DATA” on the next screen.
5. Tap the words “Last hour” to select the time and date range of search data you want to erase, then tap “CLEAR DATA.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to make Instagram highlight covers for the Stories Highlights on your profile page, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s possible to post highlights of your Instagram Stories to preserve a selection of your stories, which usually disappear after 24 hours.
After you post Instagram Stories, they will be saved in a private Stories Archive in your account. You can these choose if you want to add any to your highlights, which will appear publicly on your profile page.
Each highlight has a cover photo, and the default option is the first photo or video within that highlight. But it’s easy to change the highlight cover to another image so it looks exactly the way you want on your profile.
Here’s how to do it.
1. Launch the Instagram app on your iPhone or Android phone.
2. Tap the profile icon on the far right of the bottom menu.
3. Find your highlights under your profile bio and select the one you want to edit the cover of.
4. In the bottom right-hand corner, tap the three horizontal dots above the word “More” – this will access the highlights menu.
5. Select Edit Highlight from the pop-up menu.
6. Under Edit Highlight, tap Edit Cover.
7. Toggle through your highlights to find the photo you want to use as the cover. If the photo you want to use as the highlight’s cover is not already in your highlights, you must add it.
8. Resize it to your liking.
9. Tap Done in the upper right-hand corner, and once more to save your changes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to share a YouTube channel on desktop or mobile, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Your YouTube channel is your home base on YouTube. It’s where people can find all the videos you’ve posted, see what other channels you follow, check out your playlists, and much more.
So if you want to share all your great YouTubecontent – or even someone else’s channel – just share your YouTube channel.
Here are two easy ways to share a YouTube channel.
1. Log into your account, then click your picture in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Click “Your channel” from the drop-down menu.
3. Now simply copy the URL from your browser’s URL field (at the top of the window, below your tabs) and paste it into an email, Facebook message, or whatever other medium you prefer.
Send that off, and now your YouTube channel has been shared. The same process applies for any other YouTube channel page.
1. Launch the YouTube app, and then tap your image in the top-right.
2. Tap “Your channel” from the menu that opens.
3. Now tap the three vertical dots in the top-right.
4. Finally, tap “Share,” and then choose the method by which you want to share the channel. Even here, you can still tap “Copy link” if you want to copy and paste the URL like you would on a computer.
Again, the same process applies for any YouTube channel.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nobody wants their phone rattling around their car while they drive, getting dirty, wet, or damaged — you've got to keep that thing in place. If you're looking for a solution and nothing's sticking, you might be drawn to the iOttie iTap magnetic mount, currently on sale at Amazon for $11 ($6 off).
The vent mount uses a one-touch, spring-loaded clip to latch onto and release from your vent, allowing for quick installation and removal. The kit includes metal plates which attach to your phone or case with adhesive. The plates connect your phone to the mount, which uses rare earth magnets to provide six pounds of pull force, keeping your device firmly in place.
While the vent mount is discounted to $11 ($6 off), iOttie also offers a CD slot variant, as well as one which sticks directly to your dashboard. The CD slot mount is on sale for $14 ($7 off) and the dashboard mount is currently $13 ($7 off). You can pick up your preferred style (or all three, we don't judge here) at Amazon today.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In case you missed the recently concluded Black Friday and Cyber Monday extravaganza, this is your chance to grab a pretty sweet deal on Google’s latest flagship pair. Both the Pixel 4 and the 4 XL are down by $100 and $150, respectively, across major online stores. And if that wasn’t enough, Amazon is throwing in a free Google Wifi on top of these discounts.
While the Black Friday deals on the two Pixels do outshine the current discounts, the Amazon bundle makes them a decent deal, considering that a single unit of this previous-gen smart router retails at $99.
Despite being a few years old, Google Wifi continues to play nice with its follow-up — Nest Wifi. You can either create a mesh system with a combination of the two models or upgrade your existing Google Wifi network by adding the Nest Wifi router as the central unit. We also have a handy guide to help you add your Google Wifi routers to the Google Home app and enable WPA3 security.
You can grab your Pixel 4 or 4 XL through these links:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Update 1: 2019/12/09 2:53pm UTCThree weeks later
Cloud gaming isn't a new idea. Companies like OnLive (RIP) have been trying to make it work for the better part of a decade. Google's effectively limitless resources and software wizardry make it an ideal fit to work the kinks out of such a complicated problem, and with Stadia, it seems it may have done just that. In my time with the platform, streaming performance has been wildly impressive — but lackluster day-one game selection and plenty of half-baked features make for a rocky start for the fledgling gaming platform.
Stadia Pro bundles — both the Founders Edition and the Premiere Edition — come with a Chromecast Ultra (complete with Ethernet adapter), a Stadia controller, a USB-C charger, and a setup guide. You'll need that Chromecast to play on your TV, too, even if you've already got another Chromecast or an Android TV box plugged in — other Chromecast Ultras will get a software update sometime in the future to enable Stadia compatibility, but Google hasn't said when.
If you've played a video game in the past two decades, odds are good your fingers will feel right at home on the Stadia controller. It's got the standard layout: four face buttons arranged in a diamond, two analog sticks, a directional pad, and four shoulder buttons. There's also Google's version of start and select — "menu" and "options" — plus a not-yet-functional Google Assistant key and a Nintendo Switch-style capture button that'll grab a screenshot with a tap or a 30-second clip with a long press. Between the joysticks is a backlit button that starts Stadia up and opens the system menu once it's running.
Google talks a big game about the controller's design; the company says it studied chef's knives to craft the ideal grip. The result of all that attention to detail is a controller that feels... fine. It's plenty comfortable to hold, but the d-pad and bumpers depress with an unsatisfying plasticky click. It's not something you notice when you're engrossed in a game, but it doesn't do the pad's price tag justice — on its own, the thing costs 70 bucks.
Part of the reason for that steep asking price is Wi-Fi connectivity. The Stadia controller can connect directly to the internet, sending your inputs straight to Google's servers and eliminating the small amount of extra latency a Bluetooth connection to a local device would add in the middle. It's hard to say how much good that actually does, but it'll be nice not to have to juggle Bluetooth connections to various devices once wireless play is available on phones and in Chrome (it's only supported on the included Chromecast Ultra at launch).
It's a very handsome piece of hardware, in a traditionally Google way. Design director Isabelle Olsson has described its appearance as "human" and "optimistic" — pretty high-concept language to talk about a gamepad, but not inaccurate. The Stadia controller fits right in with Google's other friendly-looking recent hardware like the Pixel 4 and Nest Wifi. The navy and orange number included in the Founders Edition bundle is definitely pleasant (bonus points for Detroit Tigers fans), but the funky green Wasabi colorway is my favorite by a wide margin.
The Stadia interface is uniform across devices; what you see on your TV is like what you'll see in Chrome and on your phone. At launch, it's pretty barebones. From the bundled Chromecast Ultra or at stadia.google.com in Chrome, you can launch games and manage your friends list, and not much else. The Android app also lets you shop for games and DLC and view captured screenshots and clips (although you can't share them yet — that's another feature that's coming later). It's nice that the experience is at least visually consistent between all your screens, but it's a little annoying that some functionality is limited to the mobile app. Why can't I buy a game from my TV?
The Stadia app's home screen.
Purchases are tied to your Google account, and you earn Play Points for money spent on Stadia. You can use Play Store credit toward games and add-on content, too. Finally, something to spend that Google Opinion Rewards survey money on.
When launching a game from the Android app, you're given the option to start it either right there on your compatible phone — at launch, just Pixel phones from 2018 or later — or the Chromecast Ultra included in Stadia bundles. If you want to play on your phone or computer, you'll have to either connect the Stadia controller by USB or use your mouse and keyboard or other third-party peripheral. Wireless connectivity is coming later.
The Stadia store.
On day one, you'll have your choice of 22 games, up from an expected 12:
They're all good, but there's a conspicuous lack of brand-new bangers on the list; there's no Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or Jedi: Fallen Order to be found. Softball evergreen titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are also absent. There'll be more high-profile titles by the end of the year: Borderlands 3 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint are landing before 2020, among others. More big gets including Doom: Eternal and Cyberpunk 2077 are coming next year, too.
Compared to the previously announced list of a dozen launch titles, the updated crop is considerably more robust. Still, with no real system-sellers and only one exclusive in Tequila Works' horror adventure indie Gylt, it's hard to get too excited about this particular handful of titles, especially if you've already got another current-generation game machine around (then again, if you already have one of those, you're probably not interested in Stadia in the first place).
Red Dead Redemption 2, Gylt, and Destiny 2. Screens captured on Stadia.
It's comforting, then, that Stadia runs all its launch titles immaculately. On my pedestrian connection of about 100 megabits down and 10 up with something like 20 milliseconds of latency — which Stadia's built-in connection checker rates as "excellent" — I haven't experienced a single connection hiccup. Red Dead Redemption 2 runs smoothly at 1440p and 30 frames per second. I can successfully get through Mortal Kombat 11's arcade mode on medium difficulty, which is about as well as I'd expect to perform on any platform. I regularly nailed alien baddies in the dome in Destiny 2, even during Google's prescribed reviewer multiplayer times. It's crazy good.
Mortal Kombat 11 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Screens captured on Stadia.
But there's no way to tell how the system will hold up with thousands of active players, and there are about a million factors that can influence the streaming experience. Our own Matt Sholtz has a better connection than I do on paper, but Nvidia's cloud gaming service GeForce Now — which has been great for me — runs so poorly for him as to be unplayable, even on Ethernet. Will Stadia struggle on his network, too? You also might be more sensitive to input lag than I am, and missing a frame or two may completely ruin your fun. It's all very subjective.
Google Stadia7/10
You should probably wait, unless you're really into the launch titles and have no other way to play them. As impressive as the core Stadia experience has been for me, it's hard to get around the bland day-one game selection. There's currently a boatload of missing features, too: Buddy Passes that let you gift a friend three months of Stadia Pro won't be available on launch day, achievements aren't ready yet, and you can currently only use the Chromecast Ultra that comes in Stadia bundles to play on your TV, among other shortcomings. And Google's nasty habit of killing its products looms large over this one; it sure seems like the company is serious, but there's no way to know for sure where Stadia will be in five years — or if it'll be anywhere at all. I asked what happens to game purchases should Stadia fold, and was told only that Google is "committed to making Stadia a success."
If Google's commitment is genuine and Stadia holds up under normal stress as well as it has during the review period, though, it could very well have a major impact on the greater gaming landscape. If you don't already have a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you don't mind paying for the experience of games rather than ownership, and you've got a solid internet connection, Stadia would probably fit very neatly into your life. You just might want to give it a few months to see how things shake out.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google's Assistant newest iteration, which launched with the Pixel 4, has a few tricks up its sleeve, but accessing it has been restricted by some draconian requirements. You need to have a Pixel 4 with gesture navigation, no G Suite account on the same user profile, and everything has to be set to US English. That last limitation will soon be lifted with five new English variants joining in.
As was previously expected, Google is starting to relax the language requirement around the new Assistant. The company says that the digital helper will "soon" be available on the Pixel 4 in these five English variants: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and UK. These come in addition to US English.
Keep in mind that you don't need to live in one of these countries to activate the new Assistant; you just need your phone and Assistant language to be set to a supported language.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stadia's store will support trials and demos, gifting, wishlists, pre-orders, and tons of other lists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stadia launched in what what most would consider a very unfinished state, missing many plenty of the announced features like family sharing and broadcasting, or with very rushed and incomplete features like screenshots or a game store. Shopping for games initially required the smartphone app, but the store launched on the web last week, opening the door to a more convenient shopping experience. It also reveals a bit more about some of the marketing and categorization we'll see as the Stadia catalog fills out.
The roll call of titles is currently at 23 games (not counting multiple editions), so there's not much need for a list that splits them, but that's obviously not going to remain true for long. Through some experimentation on the store URLs, more than 100 pages were discovered that will be used to present games based on popularity, features, genre, publisher, and deals. There are also a few lists that confirm some notable upcoming features, like wishlists, trials and demos, and pre-orders.
For a quick refresher, four lists can be found in the web interface now, including a full list, a couple for recommendations, and one that lists the games available with Stadia Pro.
While those pages currently show a number of games, all of the other pages are currently empty. However, the names aren't hard to decipher, and most of them can be broken up into some natural categories. There are plenty of standard groups, like general recommendations, popular titles, top sellers, and those that highlight certain features (e.g. best 4K). You'll also find pages for games from major publishers like 2K, Bethesda, and Square Enix. And to round it out, there's a large list of 56 genres with everything from action and adventure to visual novels and trivia.
Recommendations
Popularity
Shopping
Teasers
Feature Highlights
Miscellaneous
Publishers
Genres
Special
The big notable lists in this group are the ones that reference upcoming features, like a list of the Most gifted games, confirming that gifting will be supported. And I think we all expected Stadia to offer Demos and Trials for some games, but now it's safe to assume those will begin appearing eventually. Pre-orders were also a given, and like most other services, there is a special Your wishlist page where you can find games you've earmarked to pick up.
Stadia will highlight games that are Popular on YouTube, and there will be a section dedicated to Stadia exclusives. Titles with major updates and new content will be shown in Recently Updated, New add-ons, and Expansions. It looks like there will also be a space oriented toward groups of games that belong together as a Collection or Compilation.
And finally, a look through the genres is somewhat enlightening. Some of the obvious groupings include Adventure, Platformer, and Sports; and since there was inexplicably some doubt about this, there are even multiple categories dedicated to getting lots of people together: MMO games, MMORPGs, and MOBA games. You'll also find some entries that don't fall into the classic categories but have earned groups of dedicated fans like Dating simulations and Visual novel. There's a lot of overlap in the list, but with 56 genre pages ready to go, Stadia clearly expects to cover most interests.
Naturally, this list is subject to change and there's plenty of room for it to grow as new requirements come up. There will be more entries as major publishers sign on, new game categories catch on, and somebody in marketing concocts a new way to pitch games — let's say, seasonal and holiday-themes...
In the meantime, let's get back to looking forward to new games and features. I'm still waiting to see how Stadia tackles livestreaming to an audience.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When you think Android TV Box, you might think Nvidia Shield TV right away, but the company best known for its graphics cards isn't the only one offering a capable big screen experience for Android. Xiaomi's Mi Box S is a neat little device outputting 4K HDR to your TV, and it's on sale at Walmart, going for only $30. That's the lowest we've ever seen and $5 less than the recent offer of $35.
Despite the bargain price, the box still checks all of the most important ... boxes. In addition to the obligatory HDMI 2.0a out, it comes with an AUX connector and a full-size USB 2.0 port so you can use external hard drives. It supports Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz and 5GHz and Bluetooth 4.1, the latter of which its remote uses to connect to the device. While the aging Android 8.1 the Mi Box S runs may seem a tad outdated, it should still outperform most of the "smart" software on cheaper TVs, and it gives you easy access to Google Assistant and Chromecast. The box is also slated to get Android 9, which is being tested as part of a beta program right now.
Head to Walmart to buy the device. If your TV is older, you might be surprised how much more life you'll be able to eke out of it thanks to the Mi Box S.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus TV gets Netflix app and new improved remote controller</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OnePlus marked its entry into the TV market this September with a pair of TV sets, one of which had a fancy motorized soundbar retracting from its bottom. Both models have so far remained exclusive to India, where they support a bunch of local streaming services, aside from Prime Video, though the Netflix app was a notable omission. That's changed now as OnePlus is bringing the app to its TV range via a system update, while newer units will ship with Netflix preinstalled. The company has also introduced a redesigned remote controller with a dedicated button for the new app.
Besides adding Netflix, the new update (v1.8.0T1911211115) for the OnePlus TV Q1 and the Q1 Pro fixes a few issues that have been plaguing existing units. OnePlus has fixed the pinkish hues and has included an option to auto-select the input source on startup. When the bundled rechargeable remote controller needs some juice, it’ll now push a notification to the screen, while OnePlus has also tried to compensate for its lack of a mute button with a silly workaround: Press both volume keys together. You can avoid this fuss with an optional upgrade to the improved controller, available without any cost to existing users.
Change log:
The original remote controller was a sleek metal slab (think: OnePlus 3/3T), but with awkwardly placed volume keys. A new controller was needed to include a dedicated Netflix button (which should be configurable using these steps), and OnePlus took this opportunity to fix its striking but flawed remote unit. The redesigned one now has a thicker plastic body, runs on a AAA battery, and has addressed the button issues. Current OnePlus TV users who got the bundled metal remote can claim their free upgrade using an invitation code that you can obtain by following a few steps mentioned on the product page. You can alternatively use the companion remote app that comes handy for typing.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you're looking for a reliable pair of workout buds, you should consider the Jabra Elite Active 65t. They initially cost $190 when they came out, but you can snatch them for $130, thanks to this markdown.
The buds are designed with fitness in mind, as they come with a built-in accelerometer for step tracking and feature IP56 water and sweat resistance. They offer about five hours of playback time, which can then be extended to ten hours thanks to the charging case. Unfortunately, the latter is filled up using a Micro-USB port, which isn't necessarily convenient if your phone charges with a more modern USB-C cable.
If you want to grab a pair, use the links below to purchase your buds from your favorite retailers.
Buy: Amazon, Best Buy

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to noise-canceling headphones, Bose is probably one of the most reliable brands on the market. Its QC 35 have long been one of the leaders on the market, and after refreshing them back in 2017, the company released an overhauled product on the market, the 700 headphones. They were initially priced at $400, but you can now get them for $50 less.
The 700 headphones offer 11 levels of noise cancellation, which you can adjust based on your preferences. Thanks to their four microphones, they're able to isolate your voice from surrounding noises. In terms of battery life, you'll get about 20 hours on a single charge, which is more than enough to go through long flights. When the time comes to fill them up, you'll be able to use a USB-C charger, which is convenient if your phone uses the same connectivity. Lastly, just like the QC35 II, they come with built-in digital assistants, as both Assistant and Alexa are there to help you out when you need a hand.
The price drop seems to be across most retailers; just pick your favorite one below to make your purchase.
Buy: Amazon, Adorama,  Best Buy, B&H, Target, Walmart

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Update 1: 2019/12/09 12:31pm UTCGoogle may actually keep its promise this time. Some users have started seeing the new Notes & Lists menu under Assistant settings > Services. It's a server-side rollout, though, so
Google Assistant's ability to manage lists has been... less than ideal. When Assistant first went live in 2016, it could add items to a shopping list, which then appeared in Google Keep. That was a nice start, but then Google decided to move the shopping list to the Home app with integration for Google Express (now Google Shopping). At long last, Assistant is finally receiving first-class support for notes and lists... maybe. Fingers crossed.
Google first announced in mid-2018 that integration with Google Keep, Any.do, and other services was in the works for Assistant. Then a Google employee reaffirmed in October 2018 that the feature was still in development, and a blog post from the following month just said "soon." Google again said to-dos and list management was coming in a January blog post, but that section was later deleted. That makes this the fifth time Google has announced this functionality.
Google didn't limit the new list/note management feature to its own Keep app, either — it also works with Any.do, AnyList, and Bring. Just like with music and video services, you can add accounts and choose your default from the Google Assistant settings (Assistant settings > Services > Notes & Lists). Interestingly, support for Todoist was mentioned in previous announcements, but is now missing.
Here's hoping more services are added in the future, like Evernote and OneNote. This functionality should start rolling out today, so it might be a little while before you see it on your own devices.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re already a PlayStation owner, considering buying one for yourself or a family member, one accessory you should consider this Christmas is a PlayStation Plus subscription.
The regular price for an annual PS Plus membership in most gaming shops or online through the PlayStation store is £49.99 - but we’ve found a fantastic website that sells them much cheaper.
Don’t forget, there’s a seven-day free trial available for anyone looking to give the PS Plus membership a try - just access it through the console menu and follow the onscreen instructions.
You'll need a PlayStation Plus membership to play PS4 games online.
On the plus side, membership also gives you access to the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection which includes two free games each month that are yours to keep while you're a subscriber.
PlayStation Plus memberships also get you exclusive discounts in sales across the PlayStation Network and lets you upload game saves to the cloud, which is brilliant for backing up your progress in case your console's hard drive fails.
If you play games online then PlayStation Plus membership is absolutely worth purchasing, if not essential to your PlayStation experience.
PS Plus membership also has benefits for those who never play online.
A constant roster of new titles to download and play for free will save you far more than the membership costs each month.
The PS Plus membership is available for a variety of lengths, ranging from 30 days to 12 months.
PlayStation Plus is also available to buy on Amazon, but the prices are on par with the official PlayStation Store - £49.99 for an annual subscription.
CDKeys is one of the cheapest prices to buy a 12-month Xbox Live Gold membership.
If you'd prefer to go down the official route, you can buy directly from the Microsoft's website for £49.99.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New steps against scammers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some of Canada's telephone providers are being called on by the country's telecom regulator to add to their arsenals in the battle against phone scammers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced Monday that it expects companies that provide Internet-based phone services to adopt new technology by next fall aimed at reducing the number of fake calls received by unsuspecting consumers.
To better protect Canadians from so-called "spoof" calls, telecom companies should be able to implement systems by Sept. 30, 2020 that will give many consumers the ability to verify whether calls they receive are from legitimate people, businesses or government agencies, the CRTC said.
The regulator wants service providers to adopt a new framework, known by the acronym STIR/SHAKEN and already adopted in parts of the United States, that will allow Canadians with Internet Protocol or VOIP-based phones, or mobile phones, to see whether calls they receive can be trusted.
"Nuisance calls are a major irritant for many Canadians," CRTC chairman Ian Scott said in a statement.
"The new STIR/SHAKEN framework will enable Canadians to know, before they answer the phone, whether a call is legitimate or whether it should be treated with suspicion."
It is not clear, however, how the calls will be verified.
That will depend on how service providers implement the technology, said the regulator, calling the required technical changes "complicated."
The regulator says that roughly 40 per cent of the 80,000 to 90,000 complaints it receives annually about unwanted phone calls revolve around caller-ID spoofing.
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has estimated Canadians have lost nearly $17 million since 2014 to scam artists who use computer programs to spoof legitimate telephone numbers, including numbers used by the Canada Revenue Agency, Service Canada and even local police.
To convince their intended victims to take their scams seriously, fraudsters use programs to change the number they're calling from to one that the receiver would trust, such as a friend or legitimate government agency. In some of the more elaborate scams, fraud artists will call the victim from a second number that also appears on a caller ID display as coming from a legitimate source.
Caller ID technology used in today's phone systems was developed with little consideration that it could be used nefariously and hasn't changed much, while the technology to exploit it has exploded.
STIR/SHAKEN ("Secure Telephony Information Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs") will enable VOIP service providers to verify whether a caller's identity can be trusted.
What that will look like on your call display hasn't been determined, the CRTC said Monday.
It could appear as a check mark or some other indicator that suggests it's OK to answer a call, officials said. Much depends on how the phone service providers implement the framework.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phone service providers expected to adopt new caller ID verification program</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA - Some of Canada's telephone providers are being called on by the country's telecom regulator to add to their arsenals in the battle against phone scammers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced Monday that it expects companies that provide Internet-based phone services to adopt new technology by next fall aimed at reducing the number of fake calls received by unsuspecting consumers.
To better protect Canadians from so-called “spoof” calls, telecom companies should be able to implement systems by Sept. 30, 2020 that will give many consumers the ability to verify whether calls they receive are from legitimate people, businesses or government agencies, the CRTC said.
The regulator wants service providers to adopt a new framework, known by the acronym STIR/SHAKEN and already adopted in parts of the United States, that will allow Canadians with Internet Protocol or VOIP-based phones, or mobile phones, to see whether calls they receive can be trusted.
“Nuisance calls are a major irritant for many Canadians,” CRTC chairman Ian Scott said in a statement.
“The new STIR/SHAKEN framework will enable Canadians to know, before they answer the phone, whether a call is legitimate or whether it should be treated with suspicion.”
It is not clear, however, how the calls will be verified.
That will depend on how service providers implement the technology, said the regulator, calling the required technical changes “complicated.”
The regulator says that roughly 40 per cent of the 80,000 to 90,000 complaints it receives annually about unwanted phone calls revolve around caller-ID spoofing.
The calls are not just a nuisance.
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has estimated Canadians have lost nearly $17 million since 2014 to scam artists who use computer programs to spoof legitimate telephone numbers, including numbers used by the Canada Revenue Agency, Service Canada and even local police.
To convince their intended victims to take their scams seriously, fraudsters use programs to change the number they're calling from to one that the receiver would trust, such as a friend or legitimate government agency. In some of the more elaborate scams, fraud artists will call the victim from a second number that also appears on a caller ID display as coming from a legitimate source.
Caller ID technology used in today's phone systems was developed with little consideration that it could be used nefariously and hasn't changed much, while the technology to exploit it has exploded.
STIR/SHAKEN (“Secure Telephony Information Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs”) will enable VOIP service providers to verify whether a caller's identity can be trusted.
What that will look like on your call display hasn't been determined, the CRTC said Monday.
It could appear as a check mark or some other indicator that suggests it's OK to answer a call, officials said. Much depends on how the phone service providers implement the framework.
The framework does not work on landline phones offered by so-called legacy service providers.
But the CRTC said major telecom companies are also expected to meet a Dec. 19 deadline to implement technology that could eliminate calls from scammers by blocking calls with misformed ID numbers such as those starting with a zero or appearing to originate overseas. Telecom service providers have also been exploring ways to trace nuisance calls back to their points of origin so they can be blocked or investigated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">25 innovative and cool iPhone accessory gifts for Apple lovers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the great things about the iPhone is that, since it’s been a staple smartphone for so long, there is a veritable ton of iPhone accessories for all sorts of budgets. Naturally, you have your high-end wireless headphones, speakers and even charging cases, but there are also straight cases, long-lasting Lightning cables and phone grips for as low as $10.
As Insider Picks’ badge-wearing tech nerds and iPhone stans, we’ve tried out tons of accessories over the years, and gifted many of these accessories to friends and family as well – all of which have been received with glee and inevitable phone calls asking for tech support.
The majority of these gifts are available with “free” two-day shipping if you subscribe to Amazon Prime, so they’ll arrive ready to wrap for Christmas if you act quickly.
It seems like iPhones get bigger every year, so why not buy a nice sturdy PopSocket grip and save your loved one the pinky strain? These handy grips stick on the back of most iPhone cases with ease and pop out twice to provide excellent grip. Your giftee can even use them to prop up their phone so it stands alone as they watch videos.
PopSocket grips come in more patterns, colors, and styles than I can count, so you’ll be sure to find one that matches the personality of your loved one. I personally love my PopSocket grip so much that I can’t imagine life without it.
There are two things wrong with the lightning cable Apple includes in the box with each new iPhone: The cable is too short and it’s too weak. Native Union’s Night Cable solves both those problems with a 10-foot-long durable cable that can easily reach to charge your phone.
It also has a handy knotted weight on it that you can move up and down the cable to ensure that your iPhone stays on the table while it charges without falling or moving. It’s our favorite long iPhone cable.
There’s nothing better than a leather iPhone case and Nomad makes our favorite ones. Not only are they durable and protective, but the cases are also made with soft Horween leather that ages beautifully. We can’t recommend these cases enough.
If your giftee loves taking high-quality photos, they’ll love having the Lume Cube Air in their mobile photography kit. The little light helps illuminate the subject of a photo when the lighting is less than ideal.
Marshall is known for its classic rock-n-roll aesthetic, and its Kilburn II Bluetooth Speaker is an icon in its own right. This speaker has the classic Marshall look and appears to be an amp at first glance. It’s actually a powerful Bluetooth speaker with a massive battery inside that can last through about 20 hours of playback. I use this speaker at home often, and I love it – your iPhone-addicted giftee will, too.
If the person you’re shopping for has an iPhone 8 or newer, you should get them a wireless charger. This one from Courant is perfect. It’s both beautiful and practical, as it charges two devices wirelessly at the same time at up to 10 watts. It’s made of Italian leather and has an attractive braided nylon cable. Thanks to its five charging coils, there are no dead spots, either.
Trust me, you don’t even want to know how dirty your loved one’s iPhone is, but with a WHOOSH! cleaning kit, their iPhone can be germ-free in seconds. This kit comes with an antimicrobial microfiber cloth and a 3.4-ounce disinfecting spray that’s safe for electronics. I use WHOOSH! all the time to keep my phone germ-free during cold and flu season.
Bang & Olufsen makes gorgeous wireless headphones that look as great as they sound. They are expensive, but the sound quality, classy design, and stable Bluetooth connectivity make them a great choice – especially for people who have an iPhone 7 or newer without the headphone jack.
There is no better smartwatch than the Apple Watch Series 5. Just about every iPhone owner will love to have one, so this is really a fail-safe gift. It can track fitness metrics, keep tabs on heart rate and health, go swimming, buzz with notifications, and so much more. It’s a true companion to the iPhone.
For the mobile gamer in your life, chances are they’d appreciate some dedicated controls for their favorite games. As excellent as Apple’s touchscreens may be, they just don’t compare to buttons and joysticks for games. Equip this with one of SteelSeries’s grips for another $10, and they’ll be off to the races – or, you know, Fortnite.
If your loved one lives a life aquatic – or is just a lovable klutz – they need the Lifeproof Fré iPhone case. This case is fully submersible in water that’s up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) deep for 1 hour. It’s also fully sealed with its built-in screen protector and port covers, so it’s safe from the elements.
With Belkin’s USB-C-to-Lightning Cable and USB-C Wall Adapter, anyone who has a newer iPhone can take advantage of faster charging speeds. The cable is also durable and well made, plus, it’s MFi certified by Apple to be safe.
It’s so easy to scratch or crack a phone screen by accident, so we recommend picking up a screen protector as a practical stocking stuffer. Zagg is famous for its screen protectors because they are durable, easy to apply, and some offer special features like blue light blocking and privacy shields.
Although there are truly wireless earbuds that sound better and cost more, Apple’s Airpods are among the best you can buy because they are just so simple and easy to use with an iPhone. They pair effortlessly, never lose connection, and they come in a wirelessly charging case that charges them.
For those that either have more expensive taste or want the absolute best and latest Apple tech, whoever you’re gifting will definitely appreciate the AirPods Pro – especially for its water resistance and active noise cancelling, neither of which the traditional AirPods have.
Although iPhone battery life has improved markedly over the years, it’s still a good idea to have a portable battery pack on hand for charging emergencies. Jackery makes our favorite battery pack because it has a good capacity and built-in lightning and micro USB cables so you don’t have to bring cables with you, too. The micro USB cable is great for charging a Kindle or wireless headphones.
Although the latest iPhones have great cameras, lens kits like this one from Olloclip make the photo quality even better. Your giftee can add fish-eye, macro, and wide-angle lenses to their iPhone with the Olloclip to take special photos.
There is nothing worse than running out of storage on your iPhone or struggling to transfer photos and files from your phone to your laptop. SanDisk’s iXpand Flash Drive for iPhone solves both problems with an elegant solution that works effortlessly.
The drive has a regular USB-A end that will fit in most laptops and a lightning end that fits all iPhones so you can offload files and transfer them back and forth. It’s great for extra photo storage.
Although sharing digital photos is fun, sharing physical photos is wonderful. Lifeprint’s portable photo printer can reproduce high-quality photos on special photo paper in a 3-by-4.5-inch size that’s perfect for sharing.
You can do lots of fun things with the app, too, and make your Live iPhone photos come to life as animated GIFs as you hold your phone above the printed photo. Lifeprint’s printers can communicate with each other, too, so if both you and your loved one have a Lifeprint printer, you can send photos to print at each other’s printers.
It’s all too easy to lose lightning cables, so it’s a great idea to stock up with a three-pack of Anker’s PowerLine cables. These 3-foot-long cables are sturdy, last a long time, and have good reach. They’re also our pick for the best iPhone lightning cable you can buy in our guide.
Just because it’s cold out doesn’t mean your iPhone-loving giftee is going to stop using their iPhone, so touchscreen gloves are the perfect gift for people in colder climes. L.L.Bean sells several different touchscreen glove options, so you can find a pair that fits your loved one’s style and hand size.
If your giftee has an iPhone 8 or newer, they’ll love this portable battery power bank, which doubles as a wireless charger. It has a 10,000mAh capacity, so it’ll charge an iPhone multiple times whether you want to juice up wirelessly or with your lightning cable.
When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is the most well-known brand and the Charge 3 is an excellent gift for iPhone owners who want to get and stay fit.
Driving without a car mount for your phone is a recipe for disaster, but luckily, you can get your loved one a phone mount like this one from iOttie for a great price. It adjusts to fit any iPhone and it’ll fit in any car’s air vent. It’s easy to angle any which way so you can see the phone properly when you drive. It’s a godsend for when you need GPS for driving directions.
Wireless chargers come in all shapes and sizes, and one of the coolest ones I’ve encountered is this desk lamp that doubles as a wireless charger. It even has a USB port at the back so you can charge with a cable, too. It also excels as a lamp, so I use it on my nightstand as a reading lamp and phone charger.
The lamp has five color temperature modes and seven brightness levels, so you can adjust it to suit your needs. The lamp’s head tilts up to 135 degrees and rotates up to 180 degrees, plus, the arm can be tilted up to 150 degrees and swivels 90 degrees, which is to say, this lamp will illuminate anything you want in just about any direction while charging your phone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">They could make a great Christmas present
(Image credit: TechRadar)
Have you been lusting over the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700? Well, you're in luck – the stellar noise-canceling headphones have dropped to their lowest price ever in a fantastic pre-Christmas discount. 
Beating any Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals we saw this year, you can now get these brilliant over-ear headphones for $349 in the US at Amazon - that's a discount of $50. 
In the UK? The savings get even better with a great deal at Peter Tyson, which cuts the price from £349 to just £285 – a saving of £64.
The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones are among the best noise-cancelling cans you can buy in 2019, with a fun, lively sound, and a head-turning design that stands out from the crowd – that's why we gave them 4.5 out of 5 stars in our review.
They're a little different to traditional noise-cancelling headphones, too; normally, they block out environmental sounds around you, so that you can hear your music more clearly (or catch some shut-eye on a noisy flight). 
However, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 apply noise cancellation to your phone calls as well – so the person you're speaking too can hear everything you say clearly even if you're stood on a busy street.
Audiophiles will be happy with the sound quality on offer here, too, as the 700s offer a wide, balanced soundstage and a vibrant character that makes them incredibly fun to listen with.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Farewell to the shark fin
The Oppo Reno 2 (Image credit: Future)
If you know the Oppo Reno series, you probably recognize the distinctive pop-up 'shark-fin' camera (as you can see in the image above). However it seems like the Oppo Reno 3 series is set to drop this stylish design quirk.
That's based on new images of the Oppo Reno 3 and Reno 3 Pro that have appeared on Oppo's Chinese website. Meanwhile, Oppo vice president Brian Shen has confirmed that there will be a 5G variant of the Reno 3, teasing an image of the front of the device, as well as a video showing the rear of the phone, on Twitter.
The images shared by Shen are labelled as showing the Reno 3 Pro 5G, but based on the Oppo Reno 5G and Reno 10x Zoom looking exactly the same, we'd expect the 5G device to be almost exactly the same as the non-5G Pro phone.
Other than the fact the Oppo Reno 3 would use a Snapdragon 765 chipset, we hadn't heard anything of the upcoming collection of phones before, but Oppo has constantly pledged itself to a 5G future, so it makes sense that the company is releasing another 5G device. 
There's a lot to unpack from the teases, but the main takeaway is that the 'shark-fin' will be no more. Instead, the Oppo Reno 3 will have a small notch, and the Pro (and presumably the Pro 5G) will have a 'punch-hole' cut-out like the Samsung Galaxy S10.
The lack of the shark-fin robs the Oppo Reno series of arguably its most distinctive feature – not as many people would have noticed the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom or Reno 2 if they looked like standard Android devices, and the upcoming phones look a lot less distinctive as a result.
Other than the sad absence of the shark-fin pop-up section, there are a few things we can tell about the upcoming Oppo Reno 3 and Reno 3 Pro from the images.
The images of the Reno 3 5G Pro also show that the screen curves around the edges of the device – that's a first for an Oppo device, and it's a design feature that's usually reserved for high-end devices, whereas the Reno phones are typically more mid-range.
Shen's caption also states the thickness of the Pro 5G will be 7.7mm, and based on that it looks like this phone will likely have a huge screen – we'd estimate it at around 6.8 inches, or at the upper limit for modern smartphone displays.
The new images also show us that the Reno 3 Pro and Pro 5G, and, but the looks of things, the Reno 3 Pro will have four rear cameras. That's the same number as the Reno 2, but we'd hope that some of the non-primary cameras were a little more powerful than on that device, as we found some of the snappers were distinctly underwhelming.
The camera array is at the top-left of the phone's rear now, not central and flush with the back of the device, as in previous Reno devices. The prior rear design was another distinctive feature of the Reno devices, and the new design looks a little more generic.
We've haven't yet heard about a launch date for the Oppo Reno 3 phones, but since we've seen this revealing look so far in advance of MWC 2020, it's possible that we'll see them before next year's mobile expo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What is AWS Glue?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keeping data together in the cloud
(Image credit: Pixabay)
Managing data is a full-time job for some (quite literally). Especially at a larger company, there may be requests to run an analytics report, move data from one repository to another, or even create “clean data” for an important new web application. In terms of data management, cloud computing services provide extreme flexibility in what you can do with data reporting, and there are quite a few tools available to help, especially for Amazon Web Services (or AWS).
AWS Glue is one of those data and cloud storage management tools. It’s known as a managed ETL, which means it is used to Extract, Transform, and Load data in preparation for reporting and analytics. AWS Glue is a data catalog for storing metadata in a central repository. It’s a way to automate ETL so that you point AWS Glue to the data that’s stored within AWS. The data becomes searchable and queryable for any of the reporting and cloud analytics you need to use.
It’s helpful to understand ETL before diving into AWS Glue and the benefits of using it. ETL is how data management employees at a company blend data so that it can be used for a query. There might be multiple data stores and multiple cloud databases, but the ETL readies the data without having to move any data stores. ETL essentially preps the data so that it is ready for analytics and reporting, as opposed to the alternative which is to actually move the data, isolate it, and then run queries in preparation for any analytics or reporting.
AWS Glue is the tool that generates ETL code for programming languages Scala or Python. Essentially, once you generate the catalog data, you can then perform searches and queries on the data using cloud computing tools such as Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum, all designed to help companies store and use data in applications. AWS Glue also works with Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) on Amazon EC2.
To understand what AWS Glue is, it’s helpful to understand how it works. For starters, data management employees, developers, and data scientists can use AWS Management Console to register the data sources. After crawling the data the ETL will then create catalogs using classifiers like JSON, CSV, and Parquet. Employees will then select a source for the ETL and generate the code needed for the reporting and analytics. Finally, the ETL can schedule recurring jobs and to prep the data for tools like AWS Lambda.
The main advantage of AWS Glue is flexibility. Many companies now use a data lake that contains a wealth of structured and unstructured data. In the past, companies were forced to move the data into a new repository, to endlessly manage the data, and to worry about the servers and infrastructure needed for their apps. Speaking of a fulltime job! That was a complicated time period in the history of Information Technology, all prior to the cloud.
With AWS Glue, there’s no need for a server on-premise (since it is all serverless and runs as a managed ETL) or even your own data center, your own local data management stores, or a dedicated employee who manages the data. Instead, AWS Glue is the glue that ties together disparate data and makes it ready and available for queries.
AWS Glue is also highly automated. It can crawl disparate data sources, identify the formats, and suggest how to use the data. Once AWS Glue does all of this, it can then generate the code you need for any data queries, transformations, or processes.
An important distinction to make here is that AWS Glue does all of its ETL processing in the cloud. That means employees don’t have to do any of the data management and prep that is often required to run ETL, such as managing endpoint security, configuring the data beforehand, moving the data to the right repository, or any of the more complicated steps such as configuring the data stores, managing storage, and configuring servers.
AWS Glue removes much of the headache involved with preparing data for analysis. Known as “heavy lifting” in the industry, it is the chore of making structured or unstructured data ready for queries. With AWS Glue, that is not needed. All of the discovery, cleansing, enriching, and moving of the data occurs behind the scenes as part of the ETL, making everything much easier for IT service management.
Because the cloud is so flexible, and there are so many different data stores, web applications, and business needs for reporting and analytics, AWS Glue helps bring some sanity to the data exploration process -- without having to do any of the back-end work first. It’s powerful in that it saves time and effort, and yet the queries can be repeatable and automated.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All the best super-sized 4K TVs
(Image credit: LG)
Sometimes, only a 75-inch TV will do. With a sense of scale far beyond smaller 55-inch or 40-inch sizes, and more big-screen models coming out every year, those wanting to go above and beyond will likely be after one of the best 75-inch 4K TVs for their next home television.
While a 75-inch TV may have seemed an absurd proposition even a couple of years ago, improved manufacturing processes and increased demand have made these behemoth screens more affordable and widespread than ever before. (Those after a truly leviathan display will need something like this 98-inch Samsung TV, but good luck affording it.)
That doesn't mean 75-inch TVs are cheap, though. You're still paying on average a lot more than smaller sizes, given the increased materials and higher-spec processors needed to make each pixel pop on such a large screen. If you see a 75-inch TV that's suspiciously affordable, it's likely using older LCD technology that was designed for smaller screens – and therefore won't be delivering the high-impact image quality you're no doubt after in this category.
So what are the best 75-inch 4K TVs, and where can you find them? You'll find everything you need in our buying guide below. 
Make sure to check back every few weeks, though, as we'll be updating this page with the latest 75-inch TV reviews – and given what we've seen so far of new sets like the TCL 8-Series 8K QLED, or LG's 8K NanoCell LCD, the top sets below could be beaten at any time.
First and foremost, be really careful about TV sales that sound too good to be true. If you see a 75-inch 4K TV for around $600, it's probably going to let you down in terms of picture performance.
So who's the main culprit that causes ugly images in the 75-inch range? Bad backlighting. While the cheapies use edge-lit LED panels that produce poor black levels and contrast, the bigger brands opt for either direct, full array LED panels – or in the case of LG, OLED panels. Both illuminate across the whole screen, and create both luscious color and 4K clarity.
Currently, our favorite 75-inch TVs are LG's series of OLEDs, which boast exceptional black levels and premium HDR. They're perfect for a dark room experience, like a home cinema, though for brightly-lit rooms you may want to consider Samsung's QLED TV series. Then there's Sony, whose efforts are impossible to ignore, and a few more affordable brands to tempt you to buy a 75-inch TV for relatively small spend.
Not sure where to start? Take a look at our favorite 75-inch 4K TVs right now, listed below for your convenience. Each series in this list has been tested and approved by our expert team of reviewers, so you can buy with confidence.
Brighter pictures are the key take away with this 75-inch behemoth
Screen size: 75-inch | Tuner: Twin Freeview HD/Twin Freesat HD | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: Smart Hub | Curved: No | Dimensions: 1680 x 337 x 1020 mm (W x H x D)
+ Cutting-edge image processing+ Wider viewing angles- Limited 8K content- No Dolby Vision or Atmos
When you're buying a TV of this size, you may want to start thinking about 8K. While there isn't much native 8K content out there to stream or play, the upscaling capabilities of high-end sets like the Samsung Q950R mean than even HD or 4K video can get an 8K overhaul, and the results speak for themselves.
Even if QLED panels can't match the contrast or black levels of OLED panels, the Q950R offers truly incredible image-processing, with more than enough strengths to make up for that disparity – and hugely improved viewing angles from even last year's QLED range.
Keep in mind that you only get the Samsung-backed HDR10+ format, rather than the competing Dolby Vision standard, meaning you won't be able to watch Netflix titles – and some Blu-ray discs – in the highest quality imaginable. The lack of Dolby Atmos, too, is a disappointment for those wanting premium audio to play through their TV speakers.
But for picture quality, smart interface, and the ability to futureproof for 8K content, make this simply the best 75-inch TV you could buy. (Don't worry, the rest of the list is cheaper.)
Read the full review:Samsung Q950R 8K QLED TV
An excellent OLED TV, now in a 77-inch size
Screen size: 77-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: OLED | Smart TV: webOS | Curved: No | Dimensions: 1722 x 1046 x 254mm
+ Dolby Vision and Atmos+ AI-enhanced smart platform- Lacks brightness vs LCD- Weaker speakers compared to higher end LG OLEDs
Not fussed about 8K? This 77-inch 4K OLED still offers startling crisp images and the vibrant colors and enhanced contrast that OLED panels are known for, with support for Dolby Vision, HLG, and Dolby Atmos audio.
With the well-organized webOS smart platform giving you easy access to the smart TV's many apps and services, and the OLED panel and upgraded a9 Gen 2 processor to make those images really pop – not to mention 2.2. channel speakers – there's very little to criticize in this excellent 2019 LG TV.
It won't go quite as bright as Samsung's QLED TVs, and may fall slightly behind on motion handling – but don't worry, you're still getting an exceptional, color-accurate picture that beats anything you'll see at the cinema. While it's available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, this larger model will have the biggest impact of the lot.

New for 2019, the 75-inch version of the 6-Series is a great value
Screen size: 75-inch | Tuner: N/A | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: LCD | Smart TV: Yes (Roku TV) | Curved: No | Dimensions: 66.1 x 40.7 x 15.9 inches (W x H x D)
+ Roku TV is great+ Bright, colorful HDR- Loss of darker details- Limited motion settings
It was announced at CES 2019 that TCL's awesome (and inexpensive) 6-Series would be getting a 75-inch version starting in 2019. The TV offers Dolby Vision support, and comes with Roku TV as its smart platform – though this size model is available exclusively to Best Buy in the US.
While TCL's 6-Series didn't impress us quite as much as the other TVs on this list, it is a competitive screen at its price point, offering bright, colorful HDR and exceptionally clear images.
If you have deep pockets and a checkbook filled with blank checks, we’d still tell you to reach deep and shell out for something higher on this list. But if the TCL 6 Series is what's in your budget, it will provide exceptional performance for the price.

Sony has the cheapest ticket to a 75-inch screen
Screen size: 75-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: LCD | Smart TV: Android TV | Curved: No | Dimensions: 1447 x 829 x 69 mm (W x H x D)
+ Excellent HDR & SDR picture quality+ Clean, open sound- Android TV is frustrating- Divisive design
Need something cheaper than the TCL 6-Series? This Sony TV was released back in 2018 and retails for just a bit less – making it an even more accessible entry point for big-screen action.
It isn't the sleekest-looking set we've reviewed: the two large feet aren't quite becoming for the size of the screen, and you likely won't have a table big enough to rest it on. But Sony's direct LED lighting system with local dimming helps create some serious image quality, particularly during 4K HDR material. 
Meanwhile, the effect of Sony's X1 Extreme video processor is to remove noise so intensely that new levels of detail are revealed. On a big TV, that's important. We also love the way the XF900 up-converts standard dynamic range (SDR) images to HDR. 
In fact, the only thing we're really annoyed about on the XF90 is its use of Android TV as its smart TV system, which (Chromecasting aside) is both cluttered and confusing. The X900F is also available as an 85-inch version in the US, too.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget Black Friday, it's all about Green Monday
(Image credit: Future)
Black Friday is now well behind us, but that doesn't mean HP is stopping the deals, with its Green Monday sale providing some seriously impressive price cuts, including a huge $1,000 off the HP Elite Dragonfly laptop.
This is a powerful 2-in-1 convertible laptop that’s both incredibly light – at under 1kg – and long lasting, thanks to a battery that can go over 24 hours on a single charge.
Not only is it incredibly light, but it’s also incredibly durable as well, meeting the requirements for the MIL-STD 810G military standard.
Usually selling for $2,885, HP has cut the price to just $1,875.25 for one day only. This model comes with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and 13.3-inch full HD display.
If that's still a little too pricey, HP has also cut the price of a number of its laptops and PCs for its Green Monday sale, and we've listed some of the best below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deals abound on iPad Pro, Mini, and Air models
(Image credit: Future) Jump To:
If you're still to scoop up an iPad deal in the holiday sales you're in luck. We've found the cheapest prices for each iPad model from a range of your favorite retailers this week. Many of these deals are Black Friday / Cyber Week discounts still in stock at various retailers, meaning there's still time to save on iPad Pro deals and more. There's also still a healthy stock of iPad Air, and Mini deals about - all still carrying their seasonal sales price tags. 
Black Friday and Cyber Monday were fantastic times to shop for an iPad, with some of the lowest discounts on 2019 and last year's models we've seen in a while. Thankfully, a few of those sales linger on into this week, and we're still seeing decent discounts on iPad Pro and Air models as well as some cheaper prices on 2018's installments. 
If you're looking for the cheapest iPad deal possible, you'll likely be looking at lower storage items. Thanks to iCloud, the 32GB and 64GB storage options available are more than workable if you're looking to stream your entertainment and keep you larger files in the cloud. That said, if you're looking for a tablet to potentially replace your laptop, or if you're going to be running several high performance apps for some hardcore work, you might want to take a look at some of the roomier options. 
If the model you're looking for has since dropped out of the seasonal sales, there's always our roundup of the best cheap iPad deals going to keep your eye on. While you're restocking your Apple products, you might also be interested in the best AirPods prices around. There are still plenty of MacBook deals to keep an eye on as well!

Not only have we listed the very best printers for Mac, we've also included our own price comparison tool, so you'll get recommendations for the best prices as well, ensuring you get a brilliant deal.
Getting the best printer for your Mac means ensuring that it can easily connect to your Apple product either via wires or wirelessly. The best printers for Macs will also be capable of high print quality. Many of us use Macs for creative work, so we need Mac printers that will do our work justice.
Sophisticated Mac-friendly inkjet for creative types
Category: colour 3-in-1 inkjet printer | Print speed: 15ppm | Paper sizes: A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 6.6kg
+ 6-ink colour fidelity  + Attractive design- Expensive     - Small paper tray
This 3-in-1 inkjet printer looks and feels like a premium model and it has the specifications to match. It uses six individual ink cartridges to achieve superior colour fidelity and prints photos at a sharp 4800 x 1200 DPI resolution. It offers AirPrint connectivity for Mac users and includes an SD Cards slot for photographers. It can automatically print both sides of a page, scan at high-resolution and with the help of its rear paper feed, it can handle almost any kind of printable media from blank CDs to fingernail stickers. It is pretty compact, given the dazzling list of features, and it’s all controlled by a generously sized colour touchscreen.
A stylish small-in-one to match your Mac
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 23ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 500 | Weight: 12.1kg
+ Compact design  + Great price- Costly cartridges- No touchscreen
Epson has done well to shrink this three-in-one to the size of a square shoebox without losing any features. Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct and AirPrint make it easy to connect to an Apple device without the need for Ethernet or USB cables. It also offers auto duplex printing, convenient USB and SD card slots and the ability to print on a very wide variety of media from blank CDs to glossy A4 photo paper. It lacks a touchscreen display, but it’s easy to use and the print quality, especially with photos, is excellent.
Inexpensive and effective inkjet all-in-one
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet MFD | Print speed: 12ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 6.6kg
+ Compact and affordable   + SD Card and USB ports- Not fast - No fax facility
Brother’s entry-level inkjet 3-in-1 bundles all of the key features such as auto duplexing and cloud printing into a delightfully compact unit. The tilting display is easy to read, but if you’re using an Apple mobile device, you can download the free iPrint&Scan app, which particularly well thought out. There are USB ports front and rear, an SD Card slot and Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi Direct, so it’s well connected too. It prints somewhat slowly at 12ppm in mono, but duplex documents appear crisp and consistent and photos on glossy paper look lifelike enough for a budget model.   
Simple cartridge-free design hits the sweet spot
Category: mono inkjet printer | Print speed: 15ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 150 | Weight: 3.5kg
+ Very economical refills + Simple/pleasing design- Slow print speed- High initial cost   
The up-front price might seem daunting, but this print-only device includes enough black ink for 6,000 pages and refills are far cheaper than cartridges. Epson’s elegant design won a Red Dot award and we have to agree that there’s something refreshingly simple about topping up the visible reservoir with a bottle of ink. There are few features here, not even AirPrint, but the iOS companion app is excellent and it compliments a Mac particularly well. Wi-Fi is built in and it can turn out duplex pages at a somewhat slow, but steady rate of 15ppm and there’s room in this streamlined machine for 150 sheets of paper. 
Bargain AirPrint inkjet ticks (almost) all the boxes
Category: colour inkjet 3-in-1 | Print speed: 8ppm (mono) | Paper sizes: A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 4kg
+ Very low price+ AirPrint and Ethernet- No auto-duplex     - Slow to print
At this aggressive price point, you might not expect much from a printer, but this 3-in-1 can print, scan and copy in colour and at a decent resolution. There’s inbuilt Wi-Fi with AirPrint compatibility for Apple users, while Epson’s iPrint companion app makes it even easier to print and scan remotely via an iPhone, or iPad. Sadly, there’s no auto duplex mode and no LCD, but it is able to print on a wide variety of media with room for 100 sheets of plain A4 paper in the main paper tray, or 20 sheets of photo paper. Usually, the catch with cheap printers is the cost of replacement cartridges, but in this case Epson’s Starfish ink is quite competitively priced too.
Cartridge-less system smashes the page costs of this AirPrint all-in-one
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 13ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 250 | Weight: 6.5kg
+ High page yield  + Low ink costs- Not very fast- Expensive 
This costly, but cost-effective all-in-one AirPrint device has swapped its cartridges for refillable ink tanks. That slashes your per-page cost considerably and Canon has included enough ink for 6,000 black and white pages and 7,700 colour – hence the hefty price tag. It prints quite slowly, but with a paper capacity of 350 sheets (250 in the main tray plus 100 in the rear tray) and such a high ink yield, it can keep on printing. It comes equipped with Wi-Fi and auto duplex mode and can be easy controlled by the iOS/Android companion app. 
The Mac-friendly printer for photographers and designers
Category: A2 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 3ppm | Paper sizes: up to A2 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 8.7kg
+ Roll paper option+ Vivid A2 prints- Large footprint - High running costs 
This A2-size print-only device will suit any business that needs to turn out professional large format colour documents. The resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 dpi gets closer to that of your Mac monitor than most and it uses Epson’s nine-colour UltraChrome HD inkset for lifelike colour shading. These cartridges come in high capacity 80ml options, while the paper input can also be upgraded to hold a roll. Unsurprisingly, it takes up quite a bit of room and the cost is high, but it’s considerably lower than outsourcing your poster prints.
Easy AirPrint all-in-one
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 20ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 500 | Weight: 12.1kg
+ Instant Ink ready + Low price point  - Costly cartridges- Flimsy plastic
At less than £40 (around $52), this three-in-one printer is something of a steal. Of course the catch comes with the relatively high price of the inkjet cartridges, but if you take out HP’s Instant Ink subscription, even this cost drops. The printer itself is rather flimsy, but it’s well kitted out with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct and AirPrint in for easy mobile printing from your Apple device. The free iOS companion app is also particularly user-friendly.
Simple and small laser printer for the Mac user
Category: colour laser printer | Print speed: 18ppm | Paper sizes: A4 | Paper capacity: 150 | Weight: 10kg
+ Small in price and size+ AirPrint and Ethernet- No auto-duplex     - No display
This colour laser printer could not be smaller or more basic in its design. There’s no LCD, no front USB port and very few features. It can’t even print on both sides of the page. However, if you only want to print on plain A4 paper and don’t need auto duplex, then this refreshingly basic print-only device will do so quickly and cheaply. Being a laser, it easily undercuts the running costs of an inkjet. Wi-Fi with AirPrint is built in, so it’ll connect readily to a Mac, or iOS device and it’s one of the few printers we’ve come across that includes a USB cable in the box.
Canon cuts ink cost with its cartridge-less solution
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 10ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 5.4kg
+ Low ink cost  + Plenty of ink included - High price point - Small display
By swapping ink cartridges for bottled ink, this inkjet printer has a far higher page yield and much lower per page cost. You can clearly see when the ink reservoirs are running low and with Wi-Fi built in and AirPrint compatibility, it’s easy to scan and print using your Apple device and the iOS companion app. It can auto duplex print and includes an automatic document feed and fax facility.

5G is typically expensive but it doesn’t have to be, as right now you can get the Moto Z4 for the remarkably low price of just $10 per month over 24 months.
That price is for the Moto Z4 from Verizon in Frost White or Flash Gray. It’s down from a standard price of $20.83 per month – so it’s less than half price, coming out at just $240 overall.
Technically, the Moto Z4 isn’t actually a 5G phone, but it can be – all you have to do is attach the 5G Moto Mod (sold separately for $349.99). So it’s still a relatively affordable way to get a 5G handset, especially at this discounted price. In fact, even at full price we declared this the cheapest of 2019’s 5G-capable handsets in our review.
And with or without 5G, the Moto Z4 is worth considering for your next phone. This is a decent mid-range handset, with a Snapdragon 675 chipset, 4GB of RAM, a 6.4-inch 1080 x 2340 OLED screen, a 48MP rear camera, and a 25MP front-facing one.
It also supports all Motorola’s other Moto Mods, so if you want an extra battery, better speakers, or a number of other things, you can clip them on.
It’s not clear how long this $10 per month offer will last, so if you’ve been eyeing up the Moto Z4 or a 5G phone in general, now’s the time to buy, and with Christmas around the corner it could also make a great present.

The Doogee S68 Pro is a sensible smartphone with a balanced configuration and a price tag that is actually very palatable. This is not a flagship smartphone like the Doogee S69 Pro, but it does offer a lot more than what you’d expect for the price, which is just under $200 (around £150, AU$300) at Gearbest.
Not only is this one of the cheapest handsets in the world to offer 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage, expandable to 1TB via an appropriate micro SD card, but it also runs on a speedy Mediatek Helio P70 CPU with a 5.9-inch full HD+ display, a massive 6800mAh battery and four cameras totaling 53-megapixels (including a Sony IMX230 21-megapixel camera). 
These are the headline features but the rest is just as good. A little known feature that it offers is wireless charging in either direction; it can be used as a charging mat, albeit trickling only 5W of power.
Don’t forget that this is an IP68/IP69K/MIL-STD-810G smartphone with plenty of protection and built to withstand some serious amount of abuse.
Other than running on Android 9.0 Pie, the presence of NFC and support for not one but four global navigation satellite systems, the Doogee S68 Pro offers Bluetooth 5.0 and 802.11ac connectivity. An excellent all-rounder that has set a new benchmark for mainstream rugged smartphone and will not break the bank.

(Image credit: Future)
If you're still looking for an Echo Dot deal to complete your smart home, you'll be happy to know you can pick up a smart speaker complete with a set of Philips Hue bulbs for a great price this week. This Echo Dot Philips Hue deal bundle was all the rage over Cyber week and is now back in stock at Amazon. You can get both a third generation Echo Dot smart speaker and two Philips Hue A19 smart bulbs for just $34 this week - that's less than the usual MSRP of either item on a normal day. 
You're essentially paying £17 for each of the items in this bundle, making this by far the cheapest we've ever seen them go for. The Echo Dot by itself is usually $49.99, making this an excellent saving just in time for the holidays. 
You're getting the standard third-generation Echo Dot everyone knows loves, with all its Alexa smart speaker goodness. But what's a smart home without bulbs? Two Philips Hue bulbs are also included in this deal. What's more, these particular A19 bulbs don't require a hub to work, meaning you don't have to shell out for that costly smart home brain to enjoy voice-controlled lighting. They link directly to Alexa through Bluetooth, leaving you with a stress-free and a reliable connection. 
Still shopping? We've gathered all the best Echo prices from around the web just for you. If you fancy even more Alexa integration, you can also find some amazing Fire Stick deals going at the moment. If you're on the fence about the Alexa ecosystem, you can always try these Apple Homepod deals.

(Image credit: Future) Jump To:
These Xbox One deals have just hit store shelves in a post-Cyber week frenzy of fantastic discounts and cheap gaming. You can save $150 on some of the most powerful gaming machines around today. Whether you're looking for an Xbox One S deal for a quick saving on a new console, or you've had your eye on a few Xbox One X deals for a while, these savings can get you straight in the game for less. These savings are seeing fantastic recent games bundled with each console as well as some impressive extra controllers or added bonuses across the US and UK. 
So which Xbox One deal do you go for? 
The Xbox One S is the standard version of the Xbox console. The One S grants you access to the Xbox library and a decent spec worthy of its current-gen standing. If you're looking to play some exclusives you missed this generation, or simply want to expand your collection for the cheapest price possible, now is the time to do so. 
The Xbox One X, on the other hand, is Microsoft's most powerful console to date. Running in 4K HDR with Dolby Atmos spatial audio, you're getting a premier gaming experience for your cash. You may be looking to upgrade your One S, or simply grab a beast of a machine straight from the off. The specs inside the Xbox One X make it buttery smooth and mean it can handle intense 4K resolution with fantastic ease, but that's also thanks to its 12GB of GDDR5 graphic memory. You're getting speedier load times, high-performance cooling, and enhanced gameplay with this beast of a console. 
With Project Scarlett on the horizon, these Xbox One deals are rapidly shifting in price to grab those final few gamers before the new console takes over. That's not to say you're going to be abandoning your console in a year's time. With Game Pass and the rate of uptake on newer consoles to consider, you'll likely get a few years of use out of the library already set up for Xbox. 
Microsoft themselves have discounted their Xbox One models, but here's our top picks from your favorite retailers. 
If you're looking for more of the best Xbox One X prices, we've been scouring the web to find all the bundles you should be looking at. If you've just bought your new console, you might also want to check out the best Game Pass deals or the best Xbox Live Gold prices around.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alexa is the new news
(Image credit: Amazon)
Have you spoken to a gadget today? There’s a good chance that have, with the number of voice-activated smart speakers and AI tasks rapidly growing as manufacturers and developers seek to cash in on the popularity of voice assistants like Alexa. When you can control gadgets, summon your favorite tunes, get a weather forecast and more simply by uttering a few words, why wouldn’t you?
But when it comes to the news, especially in a media landscape in which there are growing  concerns about misinformation in the form of ‘fake news’ – and with fact-checking processes by Facebook falling into disrepute – there’s an ongoing debate about what impact the increasing use of voice interfaces to access news will have.
While Siri was perhaps the first well-known voice assistant – and provided the inspiration for Spike Jonze’s Oscar-winning movie Her – Siri’s successors, Alexa and Google Assistant, have proved far more popular for and capable of delivering the news at our command. 
In October, we saw BBC News launch an Alexa-specific news service in a bid to engage with listeners through the popular voice assistant, with a mix of dedicated reporting and repurposed information from the BBC’s other editorial channels. (If you want to try it, just ask Alexa, “Give me BBC News”.)
To get our head around how voice search is changing the way news is accessed and distributed, and the possible consequences, we reached out to a number of figures working at the heart of digital news production and distribution.
We spoke to Mukul Devichand, executive editor at BBC Voice + AI, about the reasoning behind the British broadcaster’s dedicated Alexa news service, and what it meant for the dissemination of news in the future.
“Our journey has just begun on this,” said Devichand, calling the current Alexa service “the first iteration” in a much larger roadmap. “It’s pretty clear to me as a long-time producer and editor, that the way we tell stories should be revisited with each great shift in the internet.
“The growth of AI assistants has the potential to significantly disrupt the way we get information. Assistants offer an obvious and easy way to ask questions, which could be really transformative. What’s easier than just saying ‘tell me what’s going on’, or ‘did Brexit happen yet’, or ‘did Arsenal win the game,’ or ‘I don’t really understand why there’s a war in Syria’, to an assistant? So we may end up doing that instead of just tapping our phones.”
With smart speakers becoming fixtures in millions of homes worldwide, it’s imperative that news broadcasters cater to the new medium, in the same way they’ve adapted to scrolling news feeds and a generation accustomed to getting updates on demand through Twitter, Facebook, and Google News on their smartphones, rather than from the scheduled TV bulletins the BBC and other major broadcasters around the globe built their reputations on.
Devichand also acknowledges the changes and challenges that come with new methods of accessing information, suggesting that people today have an “expectation of 24/7 currency, and a genuine desire for interaction and depth on demand – with a great deal of confusion and mistrust given the way news is manipulated online”.
Why mistrust? “When algorithms or AI guide us to pieces of content, the dangers of misinformation, echo chambers and a polarized society are very real and present,” he explains.
Fake news is a big concern these days, whether it’s outright lies being thoughtlessly retweeted or news outlets distorting facts for the sake of a good story that readers will click on – with Facebook’s laid-back attitude towards misleading political ads proving highly controversial in the run-up to another election. 
The danger with voice search specifically is that, given the short and digestible snippets that Alexa and other smart assistants tend to provide, users could be getting an incomplete or overly simplistic picture of the day’s events, and perhaps seeing just one side of the story.
We talked to Matilde Giglio, an investor at venture capital firm Hambro Perks and a founder of Compass News, a news aggregation service that was founded with the aim of breaking news readers out of the echo chamber. Giglio sees voice search as a natural way of accessing news, even if it tends to take information out of its original context.
“Voice is seen rightly by publishers as a great opportunity to reach demographics that don't always tune into the news,” says Giglio. “The podcast boom shows how people love audio. Young people especially are turning away from mainstream sources, and they love the on-demand nature of voice that fits in with their daily routines.
“But publishers fear that they are losing control over their content when it's repackaged or curated to suit voice on demand, as with Alexa. The content also becomes separated from the publisher's own platform, and their brand risks becoming diluted.”
Giglio thinks there are opportunities for voice assistant developers to gain the trust of publishers, and the BBC News Alexa service may well be the start of a healthier relationship between news sources and the companies distributing their content.
BBC Voice + AI’s Mukul Devichand certainly thinks so, arguing that the service is a way to channel users back towards a trusted news platform, rather than giving them more leeway to dismiss sections of coverage:
“There’s been some comment since we launched the service, saying it could perpetuate echo chambers by giving people more control, but in fact it’s the opposite here – once they ask ‘Give Me BBC News’ they remain within a BBC experience that aims to be impartial and wide-ranging, and that’s the difference.”
As much as we value the convenience of a voice-based interface, or the immediacy of content funneled to us through various online channels, the ease with which we can share and receive information is the biggest obstacle to quality assurance, or basic fact-checking of what we hear and read.
Devichand speaks of the appeal of “conversational AI”, and some broadcasters and outlets may be taking steps in the right direction by gaining control of their editorial presence. However, if we’re more interested in the convenience of having a conversation with AI than it being an accurate one, that may make getting the truth into our homes increasingly harder.

Apple's initial foray into the smart home market doesn't regularly see many discounts, so this Apple HomePod deal from Best Buy is taking off. The smart speaker offers Apple's answer to Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, but carries a far more premium price tag thanks to its A8 processing and enhanced feature set. Catching any Apple HomePod deal makes for a great day, but saving $100 on one is even better. The Apple HomePod is currently available at Best Buy for $199. 
If you're looking for a smart speaker with more oomph, you might want to check out this higher-end model. Apple's contribution to the market offers vastly improved sound quality over its competitors, as well as spatial recognition to allow the speaker itself to adjust its audio to the room size and shape. There's a load of powerful tech inside this speaker, which goes a long way to justify its usual $300 price tag. You're getting a powerful audio quality here that you just don't see with other smart speakers. There's also a six-microphone array to ensure Siri can always hear you over the top of your room-filling tunes. 
This is an Apple speaker, however. That means you'll only be able to hook up the rest of your smart home if it is Apple Home Kit compatible. That shouldn't be a problem if you're just kitting out your smart home, or if you're just after a speaker with intelligent processing and Siri functionality but it is something to be wary of if you've already got an ecosystem going. 
This Apple HomePod deal is a rare opportunity to grab your Siri-enabled, high-performance speaker from Apple for less, so if you've had your eye on one in the run-up to the holidays, now is the time to jump. 
We keep track of all the best Apple HomePod prices so you can find the best deal on your new smart speaker. If you don't fancy spending that much cash right now, why not check out our best Echo Dot deals or our top picks of the best Google Nest Mini deals.

A new feature for Google Chrome has arrived that makes it easier to switch between browsing on desktop and mobile devices. The shared clipboard is a new tool that allows you to copy content from a computer and then paste it on an Android phone or tablet.
This means there's no need to send yourself an emails, or load a note-taking app like Evernote for sharing short snippets of text like addresses between devices.
As Techdows notes, the feature is enabled by default in the Android version of Chrome, so it's just the desktop version you have to tinker with.
The shared clipboard is currently only available in beta versions of Chrome for desktop, so start by installing Chrome Canary on your computer (it's available for Windows, Linux, macOS and Chrome OS).
Next, make sure you have Chrome installed on your Android phone, and ensure that you're logged into both browsers using the same Google account. Then follow these steps:
Now, highlight some text in the desktop version of Chrome, right click and select the 'Copy to [Android device]' option. The copied text will be sent to your phone – confirmed by a notification that pops up on your handset – ready for you to paste into Chrome there.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp dark mode: latest beta release gives us another early glimpse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dark times ahead
(Image credit: Shutterstock)
WhatsApp dark mode isn't quite ready yet, but image files tucked away in the latest beta release of the messaging app have given us a new glimpse of what the new, darker interface will look like.
The latest beta includes a set of new icons that, as WABetaInfo explains, will be used as avatars during calls when dark mode is active. The set includes three icons: one for broadcasts, one for individuals and one for groups.
The icons are similar to those already used in the app's light interface, but with more contrast to make them stand out better against darker backgrounds.
The call screen itself will also have a new look, with a slightly darker background, although this part of the app's interface is already on the darker side, so the changes here seem to be fairly minimal.
For some WhatsApp users, dark mode can't come soon enough. Last month, Android users reported that the app was draining their phones' batteries unusually quickly following a routine update. Although it initially declined to comment on the problem, Facebook (WhatsApp's parent company) acknowledged the issue by releasing a new update that it claims should resolve it.
If you still find WhatsApp too power-hungry, there's good news on the horizon – it looks as though the app's dark mode will be activated automatically whenever your phone is in battery-saver mode.
Light-colored pixels draw significantly more power than black ones, so switching to dark mode should help to reduce the amount of juice needed to power your screen when you're using WhatsApp.
This is particularly true for phones with AMOLED screens, where black pixels are actually switched off – and it seems that WhatsApp will have an additional extra-dark interface especially for these devices to make the most of this feature.
We don't yet know when WhatsApp dark mode will be rolled out; although there are lots of assets already tucked away in the beta release, it isn't ready for testing yet. It could arrive any time though, and we'll let you know as soon as it's available for you to install.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget the iPhone 12, this is the one to watch
2019's Samsung Galaxy S10 (Image credit: Future)
The Samsung Galaxy S11 isn't due until February 2020, but a steady stream of leaks have given us a pretty good idea of what to expect from Samsung's next flagship – and three new leaks offer more clues about the biggest S11 model, the Galaxy S11 Plus.
These leaks detail the battery size, camera specs, and rear design, of the S11 Plus (as we're expecting it to be called). The information comes from a range of sources, and we'll round it up for you.
As with all pre-release phone leaks, there are always reasons this information could be wrong, or fake, or both, so take it with a pinch of salt – but these rumors don't contradict what we'd already heard.
The first Galaxy S11 Plus leak details its battery capacity, which is set to be 5,000mAh, or 900mAh bigger than the battery in the S10 Plus. We've heard this rumor before, but this repeat backs up that assertion.
GalaxyClub managed to get its hands on a 5,000mAh battery that looks set to debut in the device – there's even a picture of the power pack, which clearly says 5,000mAh on it. 
If it does indeed get this massive battery, the Galaxy S11 Plus could last for a lot longer between charges – although because we're also expecting the display to be a lot bigger than the one on the S10 Plus, it may not last a great deal longer. 
Leak number two details the main camera on the Samsung Galaxy S11 (and presumably the S11 Plus too). We've already heard that this is set to be a 108MP snapper, but according to noted Twitter leaker @UniverseIce, it won't be the 108MP sensor we were expecting, but a completely different one. 
By saying 'exclusive', UniverseIce makes the distinction between the sensor it predicts we'll see in the Galaxy S11 sensor, and a previous 108MP sensor made by Samsung that debuted in the Xiaomi Mi Note 10.
According to the leak, this new sensor is much better than the previous one. We found the 108MP camera in the Mi Note 10 phone pretty impressive, and if the new sensor is even better, that could mean great things for Samsung's upcoming phones.
Leak three of three is some leaked pictures of the Samsung Galaxy S11 (or S11 Plus, it's not clear) in use. The pictures are rather blurry, but we can tell a bit about the phone from them.
The pictures, also shared by @UniverseIce, show someone scrolling the screen and taking a picture on what looks to be a pretty chunky phone. 
The big news here is that the camera array is in a different location to those on previous Galaxy S phones. While on current phones the cameras are arranged in a  horizontal block along the middle of the device, this image shows a vertical array on the left of the phone's rear – it looks a lot more like the Honor V30 than prior Galaxy S phones, in fact.
Many leaks have pointed to the smartphone having this design, which you can detail in our Samsung Galaxy S11 rumor roundup, but there are a variations between the leaks, so we're not totally sure if there will be two columns of cameras or just one long one.
This change is likely down to the anticipated cameras taking up more space, with a 108MP camera and 5x periscope lens, amongst other components, needing a lot of space.
One caveat here, though, is that there's no confirmation that this actually is the Galaxy S11, other than the leaker's word. Sure, they're a reliable leaker, but this doesn't look much like we'd expected the Galaxy S11 to, so we're certainly taking the images with a pinch of salt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Surface Book 3 could come with a radical new design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Detachable writing panel could make it better for artists
(Image credit: Microsoft)
The Surface Book 3 could come with a radical new design that incorporates a detachable keyboard with a panel on the back that could be used for sketching and note taking with a stylus.
The potential new design comes from a patent filing (spotted by Windows Latest), which is titled “Computing device with detachable writing input device” (catchy), and shows a computer that looks similar to the Surface Book with a detachable keyboard.
What sets it apart from previous Surface Book models is that next to the trackpad, beneath the keyboard, there is a small space for using a stylus to jot down notes.
More interestingly, when the detachable keyboard is flipped over, the back becomes a large 'writing surface”, which the user can use to write down notes or perhaps use it as a graphics tablet for hand drawing and sketching.
According to Microsoft’s patent, the detachable keyboard “also includes a second side [...] that includes a writing surface. The user may use a pen, finger, or other implement to draw on the writing surface.”
This could make the Surface Book 3 (or whatever upcoming device Microsoft is thinking of including this feature with) a very useful tool for artists and graphic designers, as well as anyone who prefers writing out notes by hand.
If this new detachable keyboard is indeed coming to the Surface Book 3, or similar device, then it could represent a welcome return to the design innovation that we felt recent Surface products have lacked.
The recently-released Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3, for example, were two devices that offered only minor upgrades compared to their predecessors, while playing it very safe when it came to design.
By taking a more radical approach to the Surface Book 3’s design, Microsoft could end up with a much more exciting device.
A few words of caution before you get too excited, though. First of all, while the Surface Book 3 is likely to happen at some point (we’d guess a 2020 release date), Microsoft has not officially announced it.
Secondly, this is just a patent, and many patents never actually end up as finished products. If the Surface Book 3 is coming, there’s no guarantee that it will feature the new detachable keyboard.
Still, we live in hope that Microsoft has taken on board the criticisms its latest round of Surface devices got, and is planning some big changes when it comes to the designs of its flagship products. 
If it doesn’t, it might find enthusiasm for its Surface devices beginning to seriously wane.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fulfilling promises
(Image credit: OnePlus)
When OnePlus TV was announced, they made it clear that the software was a big part of the experience. However, Netflix wasn’t natively available back then on the smart TV. That is finally changing with a new software update.
The OnePlus smart TV Q1 and Q1 Pro were made their global debut in India, alongside the OnePlus 7T. Back then, the company promised that Netflix would be a part of the included app ecosystem at a future date. Starting today, all OnePlus TVs sold will have Netflix pre-installed, whereas existing users will receive a software update that will add the entire content catalog of the OTT platform.
The OnePlus TV remote originally had a rather minimal design with only a few buttons, one of them being Prime Video by Amazon. Video streaming platforms usually have a mandate for a dedicated button to launch their app if a smart TV wants to have their content natively supported. It raised a few questions during the launch about how OnePlus will add support for Netflix as the remote had no extra buttons.
The solution came in the form of a new remote, which changes a few things and adds a new Netflix button that can launch the app even if the TV is sleeping. The new remote has a matte black finish and brings the volume rocker to the facia rather than the side. The keys to summon Google Assistant and Prime Video are still present. Going forward, all OnePlus TVs will ship with this new remote.
Existing users can get the new remote for free from the OnePlus Store after their serial number is verified to be from one of the earlier shipment batches. The exact process is detailed on their website if you wish to get your hands on the OnePlus TV Netflix remote.
The OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro run on a customized Android TV OS with better connectivity with smartphones. It sports a 55-inch QLED panel with a 4K resolution and starts at Rs 69,900 in India.

(Image credit: UsTwo Games) Page 1 of 10: Game of the week and the best Android racing games
There are loads of great games available for Android, but how can you pick out the gems from the dross, and amazing touchscreen experiences from botched console ports? With our lists, that’s how!
We cover the best titles on Android right now, including the finest racers, puzzlers, adventure games, arcade titles and more.
- Racing games- Adventure games- Arcade games- Endless runners- Platform games- Puzzle games- Shooting games- Sports games- Strategy games- Word games
We've tried these games out, and looked to see where the costs come in - there might be a free sticker added to some of these in the Google Play Store, but sometimes you'll need an in app purchase (IAP) to get the real benefit - so we'll make sure you know about that ahead of the download.
Check back every other week for a new game, and click through to the following pages to see the best of the best divided into the genres that best represent what people are playing right now.
Dig Dog - Treasure Hunter is a hectic arcade effort that plays out like Dig Dug or Boulder Dash in fast forward. The titular hound hunts for treasure, and must dig its way through levitating islands. Said islands are, naturally, populated by all manner of monsters, and happen to hang over spike pits.
Figuring out where the prize is, ensuring you’ve always got a route back toward the surface, and keeping baddies at bay, are all part and parcel of the pooch’s day – and it’s a hard life. Even when you master super-fast digging actions, it’s easy to miss a foe, or – after digging a little too far – find yourself rapidly heading towards the spikes.
Still, an easy mode gives you a fighting chance of getting to grips with a game that’s hugely rewarding when mastered, marrying old-school cool with modern app design.
Our favorite Android top-down, 3D and retro racers.
Repulze exists in a future beyond racers driving cars far too quickly; instead, they’re placed in experimental hovercraft that belt along at insane speeds. Track design’s traditions have also been ditched, flat courses being replaced by roller-coaster-like constructions that throw you around in stomach-churning fashion.
The game’s split into three phases. It begins with time trials that have you pass through specific colored gates, and ends with you taking on AI opponents, occasionally – and unsportingly – blowing them up with weapons.
There’s a sci-fi backstory about synthetic men and corporations, but really this one’s all about speed. At first, the twitchy controls will find you repeatedly smashing into tracksides and wondering if someone should take your hovercraft license away. But master the tracks and controls alike, and Repulze becomes an exhilarating experience as you bomb along toward the finish line.
Rush Rally 3 brings console-style rally racing to Android. For quick blasts, you can delve into single rally mode, with a co-driver bellowing in your ear; or there’s the grinding metal of rallycross, pitting you against computer cars apparently fueled by aggression. If you’re in it for the long haul, immerse yourself in a full career mode.
None of those options would matter a jot if the racing wasn’t up to much. Fortunately, it’s really good. The game looks the part, with very smart visuals and viewpoints, whether belting around a racing circuit or blazing through a forest.
The controls work well, too, providing a number of setups to accommodate a range of preferences (tilt; virtual buttons) – and skill levels. All in all, it’s enough for the game to get that coveted checkered flag.
If you're fed up with racing games paying more attention to whether the tarmac looks photorealistic rather than how much fun it should be to zoom along at insane speeds, check out Horizon Chase. This tribute to old-school arcade titles is all about the sheer joy of racing, rather than boring realism.
The visuals are vibrant, the soundtrack is jolly and cheesy, and the racing finds you constantly battling your way to the front of an aggressive pack.
If you fondly recall Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge and Top Gear, don't miss this one. (Note that Horizon Chase gives you five tracks for free. To unlock the rest, there's a single £2.29/US$2.99 IAP.)
Anyone expecting the kind of free-roaming racing from the console versions of this title are going to be miffed, but Need for Speed: Most Wanted is nonetheless one of the finest games of its kind on Android. Yes, the tracks are linear, with only the odd shortcut, but the actual racing bit is superb.
You belt along the seedy streets of a drab, gray city, trying to win events that will boost your ego and reputation alike. Wins swell your coffers, enabling you to buy new vehicles for entering special events.
The game looks gorgeous on Android and has a high-octane soundtrack to urge you onwards. But mostly, this one’s about the controls – a slick combination of responsive tilt and effortless drifting that makes everything feel closer to OutRun 2 than typically sub-optimal mobile racing fare.
The first two Riptide games had you zoom along undulating watery circuits surrounded by gleaming metal towers. Riptide GP: Renegade offers another slice of splashy futuristic racing, but this time finds you immersed in the seedy underbelly of the sport.
As with the previous games, you’re still piloting a hydrofoil, and racing involves not only going very, very fast, but also being a massive show-off at every available opportunity.
If you hit a ramp or wave that hurls you into the air, you’d best fling your ride about or do a handstand, in order to get turbo-boost on landing. Sensible racers get nothing.
The career mode finds you earning cash, upgrading your ride, and probably ignoring the slightly tiresome story bits. The racing, though, is superb – an exhilarating mix of old-school arcade thrills and modern mobile touchscreen smarts.
Mini Motor Racing is a frenetic top-down racer that finds tiny vehicles darting about claustrophobic circuits that twist and turn in a clear effort to have you repeatedly drive into walls. The cars handle more like remote control cars than real fare, meaning that races are typically tight – and easily lost if you glance away from the screen for just a moment.
There’s a ton of content here – many dozens of races set across a wide range of environments. You zoom through ruins, and scoot about beachside tracks. The AI’s sometimes a bit too aggressive, but with savvy car upgrades, and nitro boost usage when racing, you’ll be taking more than the occasional checkered flag.
Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit exists in a world where the police seem to think it’s perfectly okay to use their extremely expensive cars to ram fleeing criminals into submission. And when they’re not doing that, they belt along the streets, racing each other to (presumably) decide who pays for the day’s doughnuts.
It’s a fairly simple racer – you’re basically weaving your way through the landscape, smashing into other cars, and triggering the odd trap – but it’s exhilarating, breezy fun that echoes classic racers like Chase H.Q.
And once you’ve had your fill of being one of the nitro-happy fuzz, you can play out a career as the pursued as well, getting stuck into the kind of cop-smashing criminal antics that totally won’t be covered by your car manufacturer’s warranty.
Final Freeway 2R is a retro racing game, quite blatantly inspired by Sega’s classic OutRun. You belt along in a red car, tearing up a road where everyone’s rather suspiciously driving in the same direction. Every now and again, you hit a fork, allowing you to select your route. All the while, cheesy music blares out of your device’s speakers.
For old hands, you’ll be in a kind of gaming heaven. And arguably, this game’s better than the one that inspired it, feeling more fluid and nuanced. If you’re used to more realistic fare, give Final Freeway 2R a go – you might find yourself converted by its breezy attitude, colorful visuals, and need for truly insane speed.
Motorsport Manager Mobile 3 is a racing management game without the boring bits. Rather than sitting you in front of a glorified spreadsheet, the game is a well-balanced mix of accessibility and depth, enabling you to delve into the nitty gritty of teams, sponsors, mechanics, and even livery.
When you’re all set, you get to watch surprisingly tense and exciting top-down racing. (This being surprising because you’re largely watching numbered discs zoom around circuits.) One-off races give you a feel for things, but the real meat is starting from the bottom of the pile in the career mode, with the ultimate aim of becoming a winner.
It’s all streamlined, slick, and mobile-friendly, and a big leap on from the relatively simplistic original Motorsport Manager Mobile.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Presumably due to stock shortages

Fed up of rebooted movies? Or remakes of old games? Creativity and originality are dead in contemporary culture, you say? Well we’re not sure how you’ll feel about the prospect of ancient processors rising from the silicon grave, but this is exactly what Intel has done with its latest move in the CPU arena.
Intel’s Pentium G3420 is a Haswell chip based on a 22nm process which was released back in Q3 of 2013, over six years ago now, but as Tom’s Hardware spotted, it has been resurrected and is now back on the chip giant’s roadmap.
In a product change notification document, Intel let customers know that: “Cancelling this Product Discontinuance completely per new roadmap decision and enabling the product long term once again.”
The dual-core Pentium processor, which has a base clock speed of 3.2GHz, will apparently be sold through to May 2020.
So what’s this all about then? Surely no one wants to buy an old and crusty Pentium which was first released six years ago?
Well, no, not in the consumer sphere anyway, but this chip is aimed at PC manufacturers (for use in cheap builds) and the likes of the embedded market and thin clients.
The reason it could have been brought back, as Tom’s Hardware theorizes, is perhaps to help cope with demand in such markets, given that Intel is struggling to make enough contemporary CPUs (and thus might need to fall back to an older process, to help pick up some of the slack).
We recently heard Intel apologize for these processor shortages, which have been ongoing for some time now, and are set to remain a problem.
Investing ‘record’ levels of capital to boost 14nm production throughout the course of 2019 simply hasn’t been enough, and we have previously heard that Intel has shifted to use 22nm on CPUs which are on the fringe to help deal with demand – and arguably that might be the case here.

We're still waiting for WhatsApp dark mode to arrive on our phones, but another long-awaited feature has finally arrived on Android handsets: call waiting.
As MSPowerUser explains, the new feature is so simple, you might be surprised it didn't already exist. Until now, if you were using WhatsApp to make a call and someone else tried to call you, they would hear an 'engaged' tone, but you wouldn't receive any kind of notification to tell you they were attempting to reach you.
With the new call waiting feature, you'll be able to see that someone else is trying to reach you, and accept the call if you want.
To use call waiting, simply ensure your app is updated to version 2.19.352 or later and it will be enabled automatically. You can find out which version you're using by long-pressing the app icon and scrolling down to the bottom. It may take a couple of days for the update to roll out worldwide.
Another feature arriving with this update is the long-awaited ability to stop strangers adding you to groups. This option was first discussed in April, but is only now being rolled out to Android users. 
If you enter the app's settings and select Settings > Account > Privacy > Groups, you should see three options that determine who can add you to a group. Selecting 'Nobody' will prevent anyone from adding you to a group unless you accept an invitation by private message, 'My contacts' will only allow people in your address group to add you to groups, and 'Anyone' will (you guessed it) let anybody add you to groups, including strangers.
The feature is intended to make it harder for spammers to add people to groups and bombard them with unwanted advertising or misleading information.
WhatsApp also claims to have fixed an issue that caused the app to drain battery power unusually quickly on some Android handsets. Of course, the forthcoming dark mode will also be a great way to make the app draw less juice, but there's still no word on when that will arrive. We'll keep you updated as soon as we know more.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The wait is almost over.

The Apple Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR monitor release date has been revealed as Tuesday, December 10, with the high-end Mac and professional monitor likely shipping soon after.
The Mac Pro (2019) release date was confirmed by Apple itself in an email sent to selected customers.
While it's not certain exactly how long units will take to make their way to customers, you might find a new Mac Pro under your tree for Christmas (if you have a loving relative with very deep pockets).
There had been rumors of a December launch date, and indeed Apple was fast running out of time to make good on its promise that the Mac Pro and the Pro Display XDR were "coming this fall".
The hardware was originally shown off at WWDC 2019 back in June, but we've had to wait until now for an official launch date – and there have been three new iPhones and a new MacBook Pro since then.
We're still waiting for Apple to clarify the Mac Pro configurations and pricing, but expect full details on December 10. We do know that the base model is going to cost you a hefty $5,999 (about £4,565 / AU$8,765).
That will get you an octa-core Intel Xeon W chip, 32GB of memory and AMD Radeon Pro 580X graphics. Once you start upgrading those different components, the price is going to rise even higher.
As for the Pro Display XDR, the starting price for that is set at $4,999 (about £3,805 / AU$7,305), and that's without the stand. Obviously these pieces of hardware are aimed at the premium end of the market.
For the time being the Apple website still shows the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR as "coming soon", but that will change on December 10 – when all the questions about shipping and configurations will be answered.

(Image credit: TechRadar)
If you didn't manage to pin down that perfect headphones deal over Black Friday, you haven't missed your chance – as these Sennheiser Momentum Free Special Edition in-ear headphones are back at their lowest price ever.
At just £69.99, down from an original £179.99 RRP, you're saving over a hundred pounds for high-quality audio in a stylish Sennheiser package – all the better for being the black-and-red Special Edition exclusive to Amazon.
This deal is now live at Amazon until midnight on December 22, 2019 – or until stock on this offer runs out.
Sure, true wireless earbuds are all the rage these days, and you may find yourself drifting towards the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless instead, which currently sit at around £199. 
But if you aren't fussed about completely untethered audio, the Momentum Free earphones will still offer top-notch audio, just with a connected cable and in-line remote (which is somewhat more practical than the True Wireless model's touch controls, anyhow).
This model has been on the market for almost two years now, though, so you will be getting the slightly older Bluetooth 4.2 standard – rather than the latest 5.0 standard, which is more power-efficient and boasts a greater wireless range.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new innovation for both
2019's iPhone 11 Pro (Image credit: Future)
Two of the world's most prolific phone manufacturers may be able to supply larger batteries on the next series of flagship phones thanks to a recent battery innovation.
Apple may be able to introduce the new technology on its next series of iPhones as well as Samsung introducing it on the Galaxy S11 as well as presumably the Galaxy S11 Plus and Galaxy S11e.
According to Korean website The Elec, industry sources claim both companies will be using smaller battery protection modules on upcoming phones. That would provide space for a larger capacity battery cell without increasing the size of the phone.
Battery protection modules ensure your phone doesn't overcharge, but this slimming down doesn't do away with the technology altogether. It's instead combining two elements of the battery support together to help slim the space it takes up down.
ITM Semiconductor - a Korean supplier - is expected to be providing the tech to both companies. It's rumored to make the space needed for battery protection modules drop by almost 50%, so that may provide a significant increase in battery capacity if either company sees fit.
This is a new report that is expected to have a potential influence on all four rumored versions of the next iPhone series. 
Currently, we're expecting four iPhone 12 named devices and there may even be a more affordable handset launched alongside without the iPhone 12 moniker.
Previously we've heard similar battery tech rumors about the Galaxy S11 from the same source that claimed the company will be supplied with these smaller battery modules. 
There's no gurantee either Apple or Samsung will use this extra space for extra battery though. It may be this extra space is available in the device, but either company decides to instead slim its devices down, so take all of this with a pinch of salt for now until we hear official word from either company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft adds ‘campaign views’ phishing intel to Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft is rolling out a new email security feature designed to give businesses greater insights into phishing campaigns targeted at their workforce.
Phishing, for the uninitiated, is where a cyber attacker pretends to be someone that they are not in an email message, with a view toward tricking the recipient (e.g., a company employee) into carrying out an action such as clicking on a malicious link or giving over confidential information. Phishing attacks are among the biggest security headaches that companies face today, with a recent U.K. government report noting that “phishing emails [are] becoming more believable, and therefore harder to detect.”
And it’s against that backdrop that Microsoft revealed today that it’s launching “campaign views” as part of its Office 365 Advance Threat Protection (ATP) security suite. Microsoft launched Office 365 ATP back in 2015 to help protect organizations against malicious email messages. In addition to the existing security features Microsoft already offered against malware, viruses, and spam, ATP ushered in additional smarts including protection against unknown malware and viruses with no known signature.
With campaign views thrown into the mix, companies can now garner great context and visibility into email phishing campaigns, including how attackers are targeting them and which users within the organization are most vulnerable. So if an attack is successful, and an employee clicks on a malicious link contained within an email, for example, security teams can take steps to contain the breach and minimize the impact. More broadly, campaigns views can also help highlight inherent weaknesses in companies’ security so they can take corrective action in the future.
Through campaign views, security teams can see an overview about a specific phishing campaign, including a timeline of the sending pattern. It also shows a full list of IP addresses and senders, which messages were blocked, quarantined, delivered to the junk folder, or landed in the inbox and — crucially — which specific users were compromised.
One of the ways email phishers evade automated security systems is through making slight tweaks to each email, which may include changing the URL of a malicious link, using multiple IP addresses, employing different domains, and altering the hosting infrastructure. This polymorphous approach makes it harder for security software to spot campaigns. But by gathering all this attacker-specific intelligence and making it visible to security teams, campaign views can better enable security teams to improve their proactive defenses at a later date.
The increasing sophistication of phishing attacks has helped numerous tech startups attract venture capital (VC) funding — in the past six months alone, Valimail, Vade, and Ironscale collectively raised around $140 million for various automated technology products designed to protect companies from phishing attacks.
The campaign views feature was announced earlier this year, but it’s rolling out from today in public preview, and it should be visible to most users in the coming days and weeks.
The timing of the campaign views launch is also particularly notable, since the holiday season is typically ripe for phishing attacks as attackers bombard inboxes with malicious emails masquerading as special offers and fantastic deals.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Android augmented reality is about to take some nice steps forward today, as Google is adding a major new feature to its ARCore toolkit for developers: a Depth API capable of creating depth maps with a single device camera. Rather than requiring differential data gathered from two cameras or a dedicated time of flight sensor, the new Depth API will automatically snap multiple images as you move a single camera around and then compare the images to estimate your distance from each pixel.
Alone, that feature would be impressive, but Google’s intended use of the API is even better: occlusion, a trick by which digital objects can appear to be overlapped by real-world objects, blending the augmented and real worlds more seamlessly than with mere AR overlays. Starting today, occlusion is available in Scene Viewer — a Google developer tool for AR in Search — to over 200 million Android devices with ARCore.
There are myriad potential applications of proper depth-mapping and occlusion in AR, and Google is already suggesting how some of them will work, including an updated Houzz app that better places digital sample furniture models in real-world spaces and demos that can sense real surfaces and objects to enable digital objects to interact with and bounce off of them.
While the Depth API is supporting single-camera devices without conventional depth sensors, it’s also anticipating that time-of-flight sensors will enable even faster, dynamic occlusion that will be able to hide parts of digital objects behind real moving objects. The last three generations of iPhones have included front-facing depth sensors, certain recent Samsung and LG devices have started to add time-of-flight rear cameras, and other companies are expected to follow their lead in 2020.
Developers interested in getting access to the new Depth API will need to respond to Google’s call for collaborators, as the software apparently isn’t being made generally available to everyone quite yet. Users can see the new features in action in the latest release of the Houzz app for Android, available in the Play Store.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google proposes hybrid approach to AI transfer learning for medical imaging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Medical imaging is among the most popular application of AI and machine learning, and with good reason. Computer vision algorithms are naturally adept at spotting anomalies experts sometimes miss, in the process reducing wait times and lightening clinical workloads. Perhaps that’s why although the percentage of health care organizations that have adopted AI remains relatively low (22%) globally, the majority of practitioners (77%) believe the technology is important to the medical imaging field as a whole.
Unsurprisingly, data scientists have devoted outsize time and attention to developing AI imaging models for use in health care systems, a few of which Google scientists detail in a paper accepted to this week’s NeurIPS conference in Vancouver.  In “Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging,” coauthors hailing from Google Research (the R&D-focused arm of Google’s business) investigate the role transfer learning plays in developing image classification algorithms.
In transfer learning, a machine learning algorithm is trained in two stages. First, there’s retraining, where the algorithm is generally trained on a benchmark data set representing a diversity of categories. Next comes fine-tuning, where it is further trained on the specific target task of interest. The pretraining step helps the model to learn general features that can be reused on the target task, boosting its accuracy.
According to the team, transfer learning isn’t quite the end-all, be-all of AI training techniques. In a performance evaluation that compared a range of model architectures trained to diagnose diabetic retinopathy and five different diseases from chest x-rays, a portion of which were pretrained on an open source image data set (ImageNet), they report that transfer learning didn’t “significantly” affect performance on medical imaging tasks. Moreover, a family of simple, lightweight models performed at a level comparable to the standard architectures.
In a second test, the team studied the degree to which transfer learning affected the kinds of features and representations learned by the AI models. They analyzed and compared the hidden representations (i.e., representations of data learned in the model’s latent portions) in the different models trained to solve medical imaging tasks, computing similarity scores for some of the representations between models trained from scratch and those pretrained on ImageNet. The team concludes that for large models, representations learned from scratch tended to be much more similar to each other than those learned from transfer learning, while there was greater overlap between representation similarity scores in the case of smaller models.
To rectify these and other issues, the team proposes a hybrid approach to transfer learning, where instead of reusing the full model architecture, only a portion of is resused and the rest is redesigned to better suit the target task. They say that it confers most of the benefits of transfer learning while further enabling flexible model design. “Transfer learning is a central technique for many domain,” wrote Google Research scientists Maithra Raghu and Chiyuan Zhang in a blog post. “Many interesting open questions remain, [and we] look forward to tackling these questions in future work.”
The work comes shortly after Google detailed an AI capable of classifying chest X-rays with human-level accuracy. In another recent study, teams from the tech giant claimed to have developed a machine learning model that detects 26 skin conditions as accurately as dermatologists and a lung cancer detection AI that outperformed six human radiologists.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel previews AI advances in software testing, sequence models, and explainability</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week marks the kickoff of Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), one of the largest AI and machine learning conferences globally. NeurIPS 2017 and NeuIPS 2018 received 3,240 and 4,854 research paper submissions, respectively, and this year’s event — which takes place from December 8 to December 14 in Vancouver — is on track to handily break those records. (Submissions this year overwhelmed NeurIPS’ website, which crashed minutes before the official deadline.)
Researchers from Intel will be in attendance, as will those from tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber, Alibaba, Baidu, and countless others. For its part, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said it intends to host three dozen conference, workshop, and spotlight sessions covering topics like deep equilibrium models, imitation learning, machine programming, and more.
“Intel is making significant strides in advancing and scaling neural network technologies to handle increasingly complex and dynamic workloads — from tackling challenges with memory to researching new adaptive learning techniques,” wrote Dr. Rich Uhlig, senior fellow and managing director of Intel Labs, in a blog post. “The developments we’re showcasing at NeurIPS will help reduce memory footprints, better measure how neural networks process information, and reshape how machines learn in real time, opening up the potential for new deep learning applications that can change everything from manufacturing to health care.”
One area of research Intel plans to highlight is software development automated with machine learning. In a recent paper titled “A Zero-Positive Learning Approach for Diagnosing Software Performance Regression,” a team from Intel Labs, MIT, and Texas A&M University proposed AutoPerf, an approach to automate regression testing (errors introduced by new code check-ins) in high-performance compute code. Leveraging only nominal training data and hardware performance counters (HWPCs), or sets of special-purpose registers built into processors that store metrics from a wide range of hardware-related activities, the paper’s authors demonstrated that AutoPerf can detect some of the most complex performance bugs found in parallel programming.
AutoPerf’s secret sauce is zero-positive learning (ZPL), a semi-supervised machine learning technique initially developed for anomaly detection. Performance defects are treated as irregularities that deviate from the expected behavior of a given piece of software, which the system uses to train autoencoders (i.e., types of machine learning models that learn representations from sets of data). As for the HWPCs, which track things like processor cycles elapsed, cache hits and misses, branch predictions, and instructions executed, they serve as a mechanism to collect information on software activity without modifying source code or introducing performance-impacting overhead.
The researchers report that in experiments involving three types of regressions across 10 bugs in seven benchmarks and programs, AutoPerf hasn’t flagged a false negative. On average, it exhibits 4% profiling overhead and accurately diagnoses more performance issues than prior state-of-the-art approaches, including issues missed by expert programmers.
Might robot algorithms learn quickly and easily from human demonstrations? Researchers at Intel, alongside contributors from the University of California, Berkeley and startup Covariant.ai, assert that they can in a paper titled “Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning.” The team proposes a novel model — goalGAIL — that’s able to learn better than an expert demonstrator and that can even perform in situations with non-expert actions. They believe it could broaden robotic applications across industrial settings where algorithms might need to adapt quickly to new parts, as well as in personalized robotics, where models must adapt through demonstration to personal preference.
As the coauthors of the paper explain, a versatile form of self-supervision for robotics involves learning how to reach any previously observed state on demand. An AI model can be trained to seek to have its observation exactly match a predefined goal. However, the reward isn’t often observed in practice, because it’s extremely rare to encounter the exact sensory input twice. A technique called Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) solves this by relabeling a collected trajectory, replacing its goal with a state actually visited during that trajectory. But it’s not perfect — in cases where a specific state needs to be reached before a whole new area of the space is discovered, learning takes an inordinate amount of time. (Think navigating narrow corridors between rooms, or picking and placing an object with a mechanized arm.) That’s where goalGAIL comes in. By leveraging imitation learning, it’s able to obtain a demonstration from an expert that crafts a reward.
The researchers report that goalGAIL converges faster than HER and achieves a better final performance.
A team of Intel researchers will discuss a new approach to machine learning on sequence data, or data where the order matters. In a typical model, neurons — mathematical functions — are arranged in interconnected layers that transmit “signals” from input data and slowly adjust the synaptic strength (weights) of each connection. That’s how they extract features and learn to make predictions. The authors of “Deep Equilibrium Models,” who hail from Carnegie Mellon and Intel, say they’ve managed to replace popular multi-layered architectures with a single-layer architecture that can reach state-of-the-art performance on language benchmarks while reducing the memory footprint by 88%.
This novel construction, which the team calls a deep equilibrium model (DEQ), directly finds the points toward which multi-layer networks converge via root-finding, an algorithm for finding zeroes of continuous functions. On the open source WikiText corpus, which contains over 100 million words, it’s on par in terms of performance with Google’s Transformer-based architecture, a multi-layer model that selectively adjusts the weightings between its elements. That’s an impressive feat — Transformer models have massive memory requirements (in this case up to 9GB versus the DEQ’s maximum of 3.7GB) and can only be trained quickly on specialized hardware.
A convolutional network — a type of AI model most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery — requires substantial computing resources, memory bandwidth, and storage capacity to ingest and process data. One method of speeding the analysis is quantiziation, or the process of approximating a model with a “compressed” version of that model. But recovering the accuracy lost as a result often requires full data sets and time-consuming fine-tuning.
That’s why an Intel team partnered with a researcher from Technion in Israel to develop a quantization approach that doesn’t involve either fine-tuning or the use of a large corpus. Instead, their 4-bit post-training quantization targets models’ weights and their activation functions (the bit of a function that defines its output given an input or set of inputs). And it suggests three complementary methods — analytical clipping for integer quantization, per-channel bit allocation, and bias correction — for minimizing quantization error. This enables it to achieve accuracy that’s just a few percents less than the state-of-the-art baseline across a range of convolutional models, the team reports in a coauthored paper titled “Post Training 4-Bit Quantization of Convolutional Networks for Rapid-Deployment.”
“[Our work] introduces the first practical 4-bit post training quantization approach,” wrote the researchers. “Neural network quantization has significant benefits in reducing the amount of intermediate results … Our main findings in this paper suggest that with just a few percent accuracy degradation, retraining [convolutional] models may be unnecessary for 4-bit quantization.”
Explainability with respect to AI and machine learning is an area of intense study at Intel, and researchers there believe they (in partnership with scientists from MIT) have developed measures to better understand at least one category of model: speech models. In a paper accepted at NeurIPS 2019 (“Untangling in Invariant Speech Recognition“), they explain how they employed a recently developed statistical mechanical theory that connects the properties of AI model representations and the separability of classes to probe how data is untangled within the models.
According to the team, this statistical approach enabled them to observe that speaker-specific nuisance variations are discarded by the model’s hierarchy, whereas task-relevant properties such as words and phonemes (units of sound that distinguish one word from another in a particular language) are untangled in later layers. Higher-level concepts such as parts-of-speech and context dependence also emerge in the later layers of the network, while deep representations carry out significant temporal untangling by efficiently extracting task-relevant features at each time step of the computation.
“Both a [convolutional] architecture and [an] end-to-end [automatic speech recognition] model converge on remarkably similar behavior, despite being trained for different tasks and built with different computational blocks. They both learn to discard nuisance acoustic variations and exhibit untangling for task relevant information,” wrote the researchers. “Taken together, these findings shed light on how deep auditory models process time-dependent input signals to achieve invariant speech recognition, and show how different concepts emerge through the layers of the [model].”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Optane essentials, Part 2: Memory modes and optimal workloads</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This article is part of the Technology Insight series, made possible by funding from Intel.________________________________________________________________________________________
In Part 1, we covered the media foundations of Intel Optane technology and the different implementations of that media into three products: Optane Memory, Optane SSDs, and Optane DC persistent memory modules (DCPMMs). We also touched on how Intel software is a key ingredient in turning 3D XPoint into Intel Optane. We’ll round out our 101 with a brief look at configurations and modes.
Why? While it’s true that Optane DCPMMs require 2nd Generation Xeon Scalable processors or later, much of the Optane magic hinges on how software – especially in settings such as virtualized cloud, AI/analytics, and HPC –  can make optimal use of Optane when that media is configured into given modes.
DCPMMs can be configured into three possible modes: Memory Mode, App Direct Mode, and Dual Mode. Note that DCPMMs do not replace DRAM; you still need some DRAM in the system. But how much DCPMM capacity you complement the DRAM with will depend on your mode and specific application needs.
Memory Mode turns DRAM into an L4 cache. The cache is non-addressable and doesn’t show up in system memory counts, so all user-addressable capacity is the sum of the DCPMM capacities. No programming is needed for Memory Mode, but data contained in DCPMMs is volatile, just like with DRAM. Memory Mode provides a large memory pool with low but effective DRAM cache investment.
 
App Direct Mode allows the system to handle DRAM and DCPMM resources independently, so operations that require top speed can address DRAM and the rest can rely on larger Optane resources. Under App Direct, data in DCPMM remains persistent, which can be very helpful in minimizing large configuration reload times following a power cycle or reset. However, applications must be optimized to take advantage of App Direct. Some are already, and more are coming. Also, some user programming may be needed.
Dual Mode is a sub-set of App Direct Mode that allows some DCPMM resources to operate in Direct Mode and the remainder in App Direct.
DCPMM modes, especially the first two, tend to get the most attention for performance reasons. However, if we turn our attention to Optane SSDs, we can employ Intel Memory Drive Technology back across the CPU’s PCI Express bus. In effect, Memory Drive is much like Memory Mode, including in having data volatility, only Optane SSDs are serving in place of DCPMMs. Naturally, there’s more latency involved in reaching out to SSD resources, but the size of memory pool possible can be relatively gargantuan. As a way to contain costs on projects that require memory capacity above all else, Memory Drive can be a life-saver.
Speaking generally, Optane media excels when working with large volumes of real-time data that require low-latency access. Taking that one step further, we might add the following characteristics:
As mentioned previously, DCPMMs can be configured for either persistent or volatile operation and features latencies that are near DRAM in performance. This lends DCPMMs to deployment with workloads such as:
Returning to Optane SSDs, especially when running in a Memory Drive configuration, the following workload types perform particularly well:
For non-volatile workloads, you might consider Optane DC SSDs in applications such as:
Essentially, any storage application that suffers from I/O bottlenecking is a solid Optane SSD candidate. Also, if server monitoring tools reveal that CPU utilizations are low, this may be a sign that applications and/or VMs are memory-bound and could benefit from DCPMMs.
And that’s about it for the Optane basics. We expect the technology to slowly make more inroads in the client space, but today it remains a clear data center play. Exactly how much cost advantages and performance gains can be provided by Optane implementations will depend on an organization’s specific needs and workloads.
But the ability to bring storage so much closer to the CPU, to the point that it becomes indistinguishable from memory, is compelling and certain to open new opportunities for application developers and enterprises alike.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WalkMe raises $90 million to help people navigate user interfaces with on-screen prompts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WalkMe, a “digital adoption platform” (DAP) that helps companies integrate on-screen product walkthroughs into their software, has raised $90 million in a round of funding led by Vitruvian Partners, with participation from Insight Partners.
This takes WalkMe’s total funding to more than $300 million, including its $50 million series F round last November, when it was valued at more than $1 billion. The company says it has nearly doubled its valuation over the past year, which should put it at around $2 billion.
Founded in 2011, San Francisco-based WalkMe creates tools that enable software makers to build user-focused help functionality into their products. This may include things like tip-balloon overlays to highlight new or notable features that can be leveraged to train employees or onboard new customers. The technology can also be used to push users toward redeeming a free trial or to convert free users to a paid account. The WalkMe platform also leans heavily on automation to make real-time contextual suggestions based on how a user is interacting with an interface.
With every company now effectively becoming a software company, the need to reduce bounce rates and increase product adoption through user-friendly interfaces has never been as important. This is why being able to track how customers use online properties is so important. Companies use various tools to monitor drop-off rates on websites, thereby helping to identify areas that cause the most friction for customers and make improvements. WalkMe works in a similar vein, insofar as companies use it to glean insights into end-user behavior, but on top of that it injects support tools into apps and websites for situations where a user may be likely to drop off.
A number of companies operate in the DAP space, including San Jose’s Whatfix, which raised a $12.5 million investment earlier this year, and Raleigh’s Pendo, which raised $100 million two months ago at a $1 billion valuation. As it happens, WalkMe filed a lawsuit against Pendo last year, alleging that Pendo’s use of “lightboxes” and “tooltips” to help guide users through a software application violated its intellectual property — a New York District Court judge dismissed the case in April of this year.
WalkMe said it now works with some 2,000 clients globally, and in Q2 of this year it passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). With another $90 million in the bank, it plans to double down on its global growth, with a particular focus on Latin America.
“This latest round of funding speaks to our success and to the untapped potential of digital adoption,” said WalkMe cofounder and president Rafael Sweary. “WalkMe transforms how organizations gain visibility into their end-to-end business processes, driving workforce productivity, increasing customer satisfaction, and achieving higher operational efficiencies.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel Labs unveils cryogenic control chip for quantum computing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel Labs unveiled a first-of-its-kind cryogenic control chip — code-named Horse Ridge — that will speed up the development of quantum computing systems.
Horse Ridge will enable control of multiple quantum bits (qubits) and set a clear path toward scaling larger systems — a major milestone on the path to quantum practicality. The challenge of quantum computing is that it only really works at near-freezing temperatures right now. Intel is trying to change that, but the control chip is a step toward enabling control at very low temperatures, as it eliminates hundreds of wires going into a refrigerated case that houses the quantum computer.
Developed in partnership with Intel’s research collaborators at QuTech at Delft University of Technology, Horse Ridge is fabricated using Intel’s 22-nanometer FinFET manufacturing technology. The in-house fabrication of these control chips at Intel will dramatically accelerate the company’s ability to design, test, and optimize a commercially viable quantum computer, the company said.
A lot of research has gone into qubits, which can do simultaneous calculations. But Intel saw that controlling the qubits created another big challenge to developing large-scale commercial quantum systems, said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware, at an Intel press event. This kind of work has been going on for more than five years at Intel’s research campus in Ronler Acres, Oregon.
“It’s pretty unique in the community, as we’re going to take all these racks of electronics you see in a university lab and miniaturize that with our 22-nanometer technology and put it inside of a fridge,” said Clarke. “And so we’re starting to control our qubits very locally without having a lot of complex wires for cooling.”
In the race to realize the power and potential of quantum computers, researchers have focused extensively on qubit fabrication, building test chips that demonstrate the exponential power of a small number of qubits operating in superposition.
However, in early quantum hardware developments — including design, testing, and characterization of Intel’s silicon spin qubit and superconducting qubit systems — Intel identified a major bottleneck toward realizing commercial-scale quantum computing: interconnects and control electronics.
With Horse Ridge, Intel introduces a solution that will enable the company to control multiple qubits and set a clear path toward scaling future systems to larger qubit counts — a major milestone on the path to quantum practicality.
“We’re looking at what it’s going to take to scale quantum systems to a large number of qubits,” said Richard Uhlig, managing director of Intel Labs, in an interview with VentureBeat. “And we need to get there because until you get to thousands or millions of qubits, you’re not really going to be solving the interesting problems. If you want to do that, you have to have a strategy for configuring, reading out the state of qubits in large numbers. And today, those control electronics need to run at higher temperatures than the qubits themselves.”
Quantum computers promise the potential to tackle problems that conventional computers can’t handle by leveraging a phenomenon of quantum physics that allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously. As a result, qubits can conduct a large number of calculations at the same time — dramatically speeding up complex problem-solving.
Intel acknowledged that the quantum research community is still at mile one of a marathon toward demonstrating quantum practicality, a benchmark for determining whether a quantum system can deliver game-changing performance to solve real-world problems. Intel’s investment in quantum computing covers the full hardware and software stack in pursuit of the development and commercialization of a practical, commercially viable quantum system.
“Qubits run at low temperatures because they’re fragile,” Uhlig said. “Any noise, like thermal noise, will cause them to de-cohere. The control electronics therefore have to run at low temperatures too, unless you want to send a bunch of wires into it.”
To date, researchers have been focused on building small-scale quantum systems to demonstrate the potential of quantum devices. In these efforts, researchers have relied upon existing electronic tools and high-performance computing rack-scale instruments to connect the quantum system inside the cryogenic refrigerator to the traditional computational devices regulating qubit performance and programming the system.
These devices are often custom designed to control individual qubits, requiring hundreds of connective wires into and out of the refrigerator. However, this extensive control cabling for each qubit hinders the ability to scale the quantum system to the hundreds or thousands of qubits required to demonstrate quantum practicality, not to mention the millions of qubits required for a commercially viable quantum solution.
With Horse Ridge, Intel radically simplifies the control electronics required to operate a quantum system. Replacing these bulky instruments with a highly integrated system-on-chip (SoC) will simplify system design and allow for sophisticated signal processing techniques to accelerate set-up time, improve qubit performance, and enable the system to efficiently scale to larger qubit counts.
“One option is to run the control electronics at room temperature and run coax cables down to configure the qubits. But you can immediately see that you’re going to run into a scaling problem because you get to hundreds or thousands of cables and it’s not going to work,” Uhlig said. “What we’ve done with Horse Ridge — that’s the code name for this cryo CMOS controller — is that it’s able to run at temperatures that are much closer to the qubits themselves. It runs at about 4 degrees Kelvin. The innovation is that we solved the challenges around getting CMOS to run at that at those temperatures and still have a lot of flexibility in how the qubits are controlled and configured.”
Horse Ridge is a highly integrated mixed-signal SoC that brings the qubit controls into the quantum refrigerator — as close as possible to the qubits themselves. It effectively reduces the complexity of quantum control engineering from hundreds of cables running into and out of a refrigerator to a single unified package operating near the quantum device.
Designed to act as a radio frequency (RF) processor to control the qubits operating in the refrigerator, Horse Ridge is programmed with instructions that correspond to basic qubit operations. It translates those instructions into electromagnetic microwave pulses that can manipulate the state of the qubits.
Named for one of the coldest regions in Oregon, the Horse Ridge control chip was designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures — approximately 4 degrees Kelvin. To put this in context, 4 Kelvin is only 7 degrees Fahrenheit and 4 degrees Celsius warmer than absolute zero — a temperature so cold that atoms nearly stop moving.
Intel said this feat is particularly exciting as Intel progresses its research into silicon spin qubits, which have the potential to operate at slightly higher temperatures than current quantum systems require.
Today, a quantum computer operates at in the millikelvin range — just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. But silicon spin qubits have properties that could allow them to operate at 1 degree Kelvin or higher temperatures, which would dramatically reduce the challenges of refrigerating the quantum system.
As research progresses, Intel aims to have cryogenic controls and silicon spin qubits operate at the same temperature level. This will enable the company to create a solution with the qubits and controls in one streamlined package.
“It’s a fully working controller, one that we’ve demonstrated at at at those temperatures,” Uhlig said. “And, you know, we’ve been able to show that it works successfully, with full flexibility on the waveforms that you can even send down to the qubits for the purpose of control and readout.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nvidia trains AI to transform 2D images into 3D models</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nvidia Research created an AI system that can predict 3D properties of 2D images without any 3D training data. The work will be presented at the annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, where researchers in academia and industry share the latest in cutting-edge machine learning. Now in its 33rd year, the conference formerly known as NIPS will take place this week in Vancouver, Canada. With more than 13,000 participants, NeurIPS is the largest AI research conference of the year.
The work, which was conducted by researchers from Vector Institute, University of Toronto, Nvidia Research, and Aalto University, is detailed in the paper “Learning to Predict 3D Objects with an Interpolation-based Differentiable Renderer.”
For next steps, Nvidia director of AI and paper coauthor Sanja Fidler told VentureBeat in a phone interview that the company may attempt to extend the differentiable rendering framework (DIB-R) to more complex tasks, like rendering 3D models for multiple objects or entire scenes. Such work could have applications in gaming, AR/VR, robotics, or object tracking systems.
“Imagine you can just take a photo and out comes a 3D model, which means that you can now look at that scene that you have taken a picture of [from] all sorts of different viewpoints. You can go inside it potentially, view it from different angles — you can take old photographs in your photo collection and turn them into a 3D scene and inspect them like you were there, basically,” she said.
A number of deep learning in 3D works have already been developed. Facebook AI Research and Google’s DeepMind have also made 2D to 3D AI, but DIB-R is one of the first neural or deep learning architectures that can take 2D images and then predict several key 3D properties, such as shape, 3D geometry, and color and texture of the object, Fidler said.
“So there [are] quite a few previous works, but none of them really was able to predict all these key properties together. They’re either focusing on just predicting geometry or perhaps color, but not … shape, color, texture, and light. And this really completes — not [a] fully complete, but [a] much more complete understanding of the object in a scene,” she said.
A related work at NeurIPS attempts to predict the shape of people’s voices based on the sound of their voice.
“I think this is a very interesting domain,” Fidler said. “We didn’t tackle it in this particular paper, but in terms of deep learning, it’s another interesting input that you can provide to the neural architecture, and you can get really good 3D information. Nowadays, I think that’s definitely valid.”
DIB-R follows the release earlier this year of Kaolin, an Nvidia 3D deep learning library with a range of models to help people get started on 3D processing with neural nets.
Nvidia will present five papers at NeurIPS and will participate today in a number of collocated workshops, like Queer in AI, Latinx in AI, Black in AI, and Women in Machine Learning in AI.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bosch and Daimler launch self-driving car pilot in San Jose</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bustling San Jose — the third-largest metropolis in California, according to the 2010 census — is about to become a testbed for autonomous cars developed by Bosch and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler. Last November, the two jointly reaffirmed that they’ll pilot driverless vehicles in Silicon Valley as part of an on-demand offering revealed in July 2018. This morning, the companies announced the launch of a service in San Jose with a fleet of around 30 autonomous Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicles, though only a select group of users will be able to hail them initially.
Mercedes-Benz sedans capable of level 4 driving, or automated navigation requiring little to no human input or oversight (as outlined by the Society of Automotive Engineers), service communities along the San Carlos Street and Stevens Creek Boulevard thoroughfares between downtown and west San Jose. Intrepid riders tap Daimler’s Car2Go car-sharing service — plus MyTaxi (which the automaker acquired in 2014) and Moovel, an app that compares the price and duration of ride- and bike-sharing services, public transit, and other means of transportation — to summon rides from designated pickup locations.
The sedans aren’t completely self-driving — at least not currently. Safety drivers monitor each trip from the driver’s seat, Daimler and Bosch said, ready to take control in the event of an emergency. And the vehicles only operate during daytime hours, “when demand is the greatest.”
Daimler’s fleet platform handles backend logistics, and in the future it will allow ride-hailing partners to integrate autonomous vehicles from a range of manufacturers (including Mercedes-Benz). The platform launched for conventional (i.e., human-driven) vehicles in the Bay Area this fall following a debut in Berlin, Germany, and for this pilot it orchestrates day-to-day maintenance tasks, in addition to basic operation.
As previously announced, Nvidia’s Drive Pegasus provides the computational horsepower needed for the Mercedes-Benzs’ real-time decisioning. A powerful processor and graphics chip manages the network of electronic control units (ECUs) — the sensor-equipped microcontrollers that control the transmission, door locks, windows, and other systems. And a custom cooling system keeps the ECUs chilly as they churn through up to 100 gigabytes of data per kilometer of distance traveled.
Nvidia unveiled Nvidia Drive PX Pegasus at GTC Europe in October 2017 in Munich, Germany. The company’s two Xavier system-on-chips and dual graphics cards are capable of performing more than 320 trillion operations per second, Nvidia claims, and of transferring up to a terabyte of data a second while ingesting data from up to 16 cameras and six lidar sensors. Bosch and Daimler estimate the performance is on par with about six “synchronized, highly advanced” desktop computers and assert that Pegasus — drawing on a bevy of radar, vision, and ultrasound sensors — can react to changing road conditions within 20 milliseconds.
“If automated driving is to become everyday reality, the technology has to work reliably and safely. And this is where we need tests such as our pilot project in San Jose,” said Dr. Michael Fausten, head of engineering for urban automated driving at Bosch. Dr. Uwe Keller, who is head of autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz, added: “It’s not just the automated vehicles that have to prove their mettle. We also need proof that they can fit in as a piece of the urban mobility puzzle. We can test both these things in San Jose.”
Bosch and Daimler took the wraps off their self-driving partnership in 2017, with the goal of getting self-driving cars on roads in the next decade. It’s a symbiotic relationship: Bosch supplies components such as sensors, actuators, and control units, and Daimler contributes development vehicles and test facilities.
Both companies have at their disposal a million-square-foot proving ground designed especially for automated driving, which is located in Germany. There, they’re able to model complex traffic situations with high accuracy and as often as desired, complementing tests performed in simulation.
Bosch has made its autonomous driving ambitions abundantly clear. Last year, it created a new Connected Mobility Services division staffed with more than 600 employees, acquired B2B ride-sharing startup Splitting Fares, and partnered with TomTom on mapping systems that’ll help vehicles see the road ahead.
Daimler, for its part, in June 2018 obtained a permit from the Chinese government allowing it to test self-driving cars powered by Baidu’s Apollo platform on public roads in Beijing. (It already has permits for testing self-driving cars in the U.S. and Germany.)

As reported before the chinese ELEPHONE brand is not holding back with their expansion plans and next target for it is Pakistan. Yesterday at the Serena hotel in Islamabad they had a big launch party and conference to usher the brand to the local market. It has been attended by more than 150 guests, including local government officials, operators, dealers, embassy officials, as well as local media journalists. Miss Hareem Farooq will also work together with them as a brand spokesperson to introduce ELEPHONE products to more Pakistani users.
This conference symbolized the official beginning of the journey of ELEPHONE in Pakistan and of course the brand needs also the distribution platform. The official ELEPHONE Pakistan brand store is now online too so it’s already available and serving the local customers. The initial portfolio of products is maybe even bigger than originally expected and features not just phones, but also the smart wearables including watches and smartbands.
Specifically there are phone models like the flagship ELEPHONE U2 with pop-up dual selfie cameras and Helio P70 processor, cheaper ELEPHONE PX with single pop-up selfie camera and Helio P23 or the budget ELEPHONE A6 Max and A6 Mini for the more money conscious users. And from the smart wearable section the Pakistani customer can choose from the W3 smartwatch model or Band 5 and W7 GPS smartband models.

Trends change over time and the smartphone sector is one of the most innovative today. The sliding mechanisms, the notch, the pop-up camera … Many are the novelties that have reached the market over the years and all of them have the same purpose which is making the most of the device screen without losing photographic quality. Well, Xiaomi is already preparing a new system that can revolutionize everything with the upcoming Xiaomi Mi Mix 4.
We have already been able to see this design in some Oppo, LG or Samsung device, all of them are prototypes in which the camera would be hidden under the screen so as not to have to depend on another system to include the sensor. Xiaomi was one of the first brands that joined this trend , and the Chinese company continues to show interest in a mechanism that can become the trend of the future.
The Asian giant remains one of the manufacturers that include more innovation in its devices. The 108-megapixel camera of the Mi Note 10 has been one of Xiaomi’s latest surprises, and everything seems to indicate that the photographic system will continue to be one of the highlights of the Chinese company in the future. On this occasion, we talked about a new mechanism that includes as a base the inclusion of the front camera under the screen.
ITHome has been the medium that has revealed the first details of a patent in which a mechanism that can give a new air to the design appears. The new mechanism is based on the transmission of light caused by pixels that can be controlled at will. That is, the light can pass through the screen to the sensor to take the picture. Without having to resort to another type of mechanism. That is why the panel would display the images as usual and would change when using the front camera. From that moment, the selected pixels will begin to act so that the sensor can capture the light. And capture the photograph.
Since the opening of the new section dedicated to photography, Xiaomi has greatly improved its cameras. Without a doubt, one of the weak points of the brand since its inception. Now, the Chinese company is able to release top photographic systems such as the Mi Note 10. And some innovations as outstanding as the camera under the screen. We will see how this issue evolves and when the first mobile of this type comes to market (expected to be the Xiaomi Mi Mix 4).

Xiaomi eco-chain of products has really a vast range of available goodies and gadgets, which is a blessing for a customer right before the Xmas shopping spree. You can find more or less anything in their portfolio, even though some products are not directly branded by Xiaomi and rather launched via subsidiary makers. And today we have for you two interesting Xiaomi gadgets from stocks on Ebay, the handy portable Xiaomi Pocket AR printer and Baseus ENCOK E09 wireless speaker and alarm clock.
Portable printers based on the zinc print technology is nothing new, but still it’s a very neat system of instantly making smaller photos without the need for ink or toner. Not to mention the portable size fitting easily in a pocket. Xiaomi Pocket AR printer is just like that and can offer compact dimensions, 3-inch images printed on self-adhesive photo paper, AR video printing function, voice photo and much more. On Ebay you can find either the printer for just $58.99 or you can opt for some extra photo papers packaged in. Like 20pcs of the photo paper with the printer itself for just $66.49.
Many of us are relying just on your mobile phones to wake us up with the alarm, but the nightstand alarm clocks are certainly not dead either. Especially when you have such universal device like the Baseus ENCOK E09 from Xiaomi eco-chain filling various roles. It is an alarm clock with dual alarms and two adjustable light modes, wireless Bluetooth speaker with dual 3W speakers and 40mm driver units or FM radio. Built-in 1500 mAh battery should offer more than 40 hours of standby time if needed or 6 hours of music playback. You can get it in pink, black or white color for just $25.99.

The Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite continues to leak. While the launch is imminent, an online retailer has unveiled the price of both smartphones in Europe.
A leak came to lift the veil on the price of the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite in Europe as reported by our colleagues at GSMArena this December 9. Datart, an online retailer based in Slovakia, has mistakenly put online the prices in euros for both smartphones.
The Galaxy S10 Lite, renamed Galaxy A91 in some markets, will be visibly marketed at a price of 669 euros ($740). Attention, the real price in other European countries can obviously vary of some tens of euros. Not surprisingly, the device is a little cheaper than the Galaxy S10e , which is sold for 749 euros ($830).

Side technical sheet, there is a Snapdragon 730/735 SoC supported by 8 GB RAM and internal storage of 128 GB.
In the process, Datart also unveiled the European price of Galaxy A71 and Galaxy A51, new midrange phones. The Galaxy A71 will be sold at a price of 469 euros ($520). Against 375 euros ($415) for the Galaxy A51. Both smartphones come with a punch-hole for the front camera like the Galaxy Note 10.

With the end of the Galaxy S10 Android 10 beta program, Samsung is working hard to deliver the update for the Note 10 duo. Last week, the company rolled a fourth beta version for the Galaxy Note 10 duo.
Now, we have new information regarding the official release of the stable version for the Galaxy Note 10 & Note 10+. It will start to roll out before the end of this year. The community manager at Samsung’s official forum in South Korea has confirmed it. It is the same guy who has a record to announce the accurate dates of Android 10 beta updates. The fixed release date has not unveiled yet, but the other guy with the user name Galaxy3813 has mentioned that stable update would release before December 25. He is a brand ambassador at the Samsung Community forum & helping others in beta testing.
This means that the 4th beta will be the last one for the devices. The beta community manager has also confirmed that the Galaxy Fold is not going to get the beta version. Last week, the company has declared any Galaxy A series devices will not get the beta version, instead, they will get a stable version.
The last firmware version carries G97**XXU1ZSL4 and weighs around 540MB in size. The update comes to address a reboot issue while playing music. Those who were missing the lack of vibration when separating the S-Pen will be happy to know that this update comes to fix this. Last but not least is fixes the issue that made apps failing to run normally even after all permissions were granted.
At the end of last month, Samsung has released stable One UI 2.0 with Android 10 version for Galaxy S10 series smartphones. It rolled out for both beta & non-beta users. The latest update has now spread in all the major countries. Now it is time for Galaxy Note 10 & Note 10+ users to taste the new One UI 2.0 with Android 10 update. We will inform you when the company reveals the official release date.

Following the Snapdragon 835, Snapdragon 850 and Snapdragon 8cx released in the previous months, American tech giant – Qualcomm – continued to work very closely with Microsoft to explore the concept of “fully connected PCs” even further. This cooperation brought us the freshly released Snapdragon 7c and Snapdragon 8c platforms. Two more SoCs that increase the leadership of Qualcomm in the Windows 10 on ARM ecosystem.
Now, while the cooperation appears to be working well for the two companies, the flip side is that Qualcomm is currently the only tech firm providing a processor for the platform. Thus why some call it “Windows 10 on Snapdragon” instead of its real name “Windows 10 on ARM”.
Qualcomm isn’t the only company interested in the Windows 10 on ARM though. MediaTek and Samsung are currently working to supply a dedicated chip platform for the ecosystem as well. But another brand might be joining the party – Chinese tech giant Huawei.
Huawei would be advantaged by their maturity in the ARM chip design technology, with the additional bonus that the company could use the tech on high-performance servers, instead of just smartphones and IoT products.
Currently, Huawei produces the Huawei Kunpeng D920S10 desktop motherboard. The PC component supports quad-core or eight-core ARM processors and 64GB DDR4-2400 RAM. Plus it has SATA 3.0 ports, PCIe 3.0 slots, USB 3.0 port, USB 2.0 ports a Gigabit Ethernet etc.. Therefore, it wouldn’t be too difficult for Huawei to build a Win10 on ARM machine based on the Kirin or Kunpeng platform.
Either way, at the moment, Windows 10 on ARM only supports 32-bit programs; bringing a worse efficiency compared to the full-on Microsoft Windows OS when running .exe files. Thus Huawei might want to wait to see how things plan out before investing too heavily in the new ecosystem.

In early 2019, CHUWI launched a 2-in-1 tablet UBook on Kickstarter, which had raised more than 450,000 dollars. Recently, CHUWI upgrade the configuration of UBook and relaunch it this month.
Upgraded to Intel N4100, more powerful and smooth
Upgraded from the previous Intel 6Y30 to the Intel N4100, the processor features quad-core and four threads, the highest frequency reaches up to 2.4 GHz. In addition to upgraded performance, the processor of Intel N4100 has low power consumption, which can work smoothly and efficiently.
For the graphics processing, UBook is upgraded from the Intel UHD 515 to Intel UHD 600, which can decode 4K video easily.
eMMC→SSD, faster than ever
For the storage, UBook has upgraded from the previous eMMC to large 256GB SSD, which is faster in reading and writing. With the storage combination of 8GB LPDDR4+256GB SSD, UBook is more efficient in dealing with multiple tasks.
Compared with the popular tablet Surface Go, UBook is more cost-efficient.
Storage
At similar price, compared with UBook 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space,  Surface Go has only 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space, which is poorer not only in the speed of reading and writing but also in the storage.
Interface expansion
UBook has the interface of versatile USB Type-C, USB 3.0, headphone jack, DC charging, Micro HDMI and Micro SD. Various interface make it easier to charge, upload data and transmit video.
However, Surface Go only has USB-C, headphone jack and Micro SD interface. With the only USB-C interface, it is unable to charge while doing other operations. User has to buy Surface Dock which is specially designed for Surface Connect interface.
In general, the configuration of UBook has upgraded in many aspects. Not only the upgraded processor of Intel N4100 and large SSD storage, various interfaces also make it more powerful to deal with task. As the information released, the price of UBook is about $350. With decent performance and low price, UBook can be a good choice for user to buy a portable 2-in-1 tablet. More information of course available on the official website.

Pursuing a genuine full-screen design will ruin the smartphone makers. They are all investing a lot in the design of such screens. Also, they want the phone display to get larger and larger. In other niches, it’s called Gigantomania. In this sense, China-based smartphone markets have been on everyone’s lips. First, Xiaomi released its original MIX series handset. Later the market hosted devices with bangs, a drop screen design, and a punch-hole screen design. But this is not all. Some companies like Nubia released dual-screen handsets. Thus year, two tech giants introduced their folding screen smartphones. But Xiaomi will always stand out. Not that long ago, it showcased a concept phone, the Mi MIX Alpha. It takes the full-screen concept a step higher in comparison to the previous-gen Mi MIX 3 with sliding screen design. But the latter may return in face of another Xiaomi smartphone.
Recently, tigermobiles released a new Xiaomi smartphone design patent. As the photos show, the phone uses a quad-camera module and a sliding display design to expand the screen area.
Interestingly, Xiaomi applied for a design patent to the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China as early as August 28, 2018. But this patent was officially announced on December 6, 2019.
From the sketches published by CNIPA and the sketches designed by tigermobiles, we can see that this phone uses a front dual-camera design. The left side of the phone has a large frame. And the other three sides look narrower. The back of the phone also uses a dual-camera design.
The difference is that this phone can be rolled sideways to get a bigger screen. In order to increase the screen display area, many smartphone manufacturers choose two design methods: foldable screen and surround screen. In this sense, the sliding screen is a new design.

While the Huawei P40 series is expected to come in March of next year, the upcoming smartphone lineup could actually see the light of day earlier than that. The latest speculations do indeed suggest the P40 could launch at the CES in January or at MWC in February. That said, as it always happens, details about the handsets precede their launch date; thus let’s have a look at the first alleged render of the Huawei P40 series.
As we can see in the image above, the smartphone appears to feature a curved display; very similar to the one we find on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, although less prominent. Meanwhile in the upper part of the render, we can clearly see a large camera bump that most likely encases a total of four cameras.
Finally, as far as the side buttons are concerned, we find the typical volume rocker – power on / off configuration on the right side of the handset.
Specs wise, the Huawei P40 is expected to pack a Huawei Kirin 990 5G SoC. The successor of this CPU – the Kirin 1020 – is indeed launching in September of 2020; just in time to get equipped on the Huawei Mate 40 series.
According to rumors, the P40 series will also adopt a large 6.57-inch AMOLED screen with dual punch-hole design; which will feature 2K+ resolution and support HDR content.
In the camera department, albeit we just said the bump will probably contain four sensors, there’s still a chance Huawei will add a fifth sensor beside the four. That’s due to the presence of four sensors on the P30 series and the “need” for an upgrade.

The day has come when India customers will finally be able to purchase the Vivo V17. Back in the Summer, we saw the birth of Vivo V17 Neo, followed by Vivo V17 Pro in September. Back in the last month, the company released the V17 in Russia, but it’s a different smartphone with a diamond-shaped camera design. Now, we have an L-shaped camera handset with the same V17 moniker.
Despite the obvious differences in design, the V17 has the same Snapdragon 675 SoC coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The L-shaped camera comprises four shooters. The main one is a 48MP module that comes along with an 8MP ultra-wide angle module. Completing the camera package we have a 2MP depth sensor with another 2MP camera for macro shots.
Vivo V17 boasts a 6.55-inch OLED panel with a punch-hole design serving as a house for the 32MP f/2.0 front-facing sensor. The display has a FullHD+ resolution and slim bezels. The handset draws power from a 4,500mAh battery that charges with 18W fast-charging. The software department is run by Android 9 Pie which has FunTouch 9.2 running atop.
Indian customers can opt between the Glacier Ice White or Midnight Black color variants. The new mid-range device retails for INR22,990 (~$325/€290). The handset will be available for purchase through Vivo’s official website, but should also reach other online stores in the coming days.

Not that long ago, the mobile devices market recognized only one king – Nokia. But the emergence of smartphones helped HTC dethrone the Finnish brand. However, the glory of this Taiwanese manufacturer didn’t last long. Now the mobile world leaders are Samsung and Apple. But the Chinese smartphone maker companies are breathing down the neck of these two. Huawei has been in the third position for a couple of years. And in some quarters, it even surpasses the Cupertino-based company. But what about other China-based brands? When asking this question, most of you will think of Xiaomi. Today, the special conference held in Japan, the manufacturer official uncovered that Xiaomi is the world’s fourth smartphone maker.
It turns out this manufacturer has deployed operations in more than 90 countries and regions around the world. But what’s interesting, in 42 countries and regions, Xiaomi has achieved good results, landing in the top five. This simply means, in almost half of the markets, Xiaomi is among the leaders. Thus, the recognition rate of this brand is quite high.

But if Xiaomi’s performance is the smartphone market is expected, many are not aware of the myriads of products this company is launching. Say, Xiaomi has currently deployed more than 2,000 ecosystems and consumer IoT devices. Due to this, it has become one of the world’s largest consumer IoT platforms, with a total of 213.2 million IoT access devices.
Finally, Xiaomi also emphasized that hardware profits will be guaranteed to not exceed 5% in all markets.

Vivo’s vice president and general manager for the Chinese market, Liu Hong, just revealed some details about the upcoming Vivo X30 series at the Dongguan media communication meeting that took place in China today.
Liu Hong confirmed once again that Vivo’s X30 series will debut with the new Exynos 980; an “AI chip” jointly developed by Vivo and Samsung.
According to official reports, the Exynos 980 is the world ’s first mass-produced Cortex A77 architecture dual-mode 5G SoC. With more than 500 engineers employed in R&D by the Chinese phone maker. Additionally, the joint research and development time between the two companies has been of nearly 10 months; thus why the X30 series will be the first to equip the CPU.
Liu Hong also revealed that the Vivo X30 series is already being mass-produced; with a daily output close to 100,000 units. The X30 5G will be Vivo’s first dual-mode 5G phone and it will debut in the Chinese province Guilin on December 16th.
Samsung’s Exynos 980 CPU isn’t the only interesting piece of hardware we’ll find on the X30 series though. The smartphone will indeed also pack a periscope super telephoto lens, which supports up to 60x super zoom; plus we’ll find another dedicated portrait lens.
Finally, it’s worth reminding that the vivo X30 series will use a small-aperture punch-hole screen solution and will support under display fingerprint recognition. This is the first time that the X series adopts this type full-screen design, a trend that’s apparently getting more common.
Either way, in exactly a week we’ll learn more about the latest Vivo flagship; most importantly its retail price.

On December 6th, Nokia finally announced the much teased Nokia 2.3 entry-level phone. Today, the device went on pre-order in Russia with a price tag of 7990 Rubles, around $125 or 113€ at the current exchange rates.
As we can see on Nokia’s Russian official website, the Nokia 2.3 is available in all the color variants announced at lunch. Thus it’s possible to pick between Cyan Green, Sand and Charcoal. That said, the website does not show when the devices will actually be shipped. So, if you’re from Russia, you can probably wait a little longer before pre-ordering one.
Specs wise, the Nokia 2.3 comes with a 6.2-inch HD + 19: 9 screen; along with a waterdrop notch and In-Cell technology to improve the viewing experience. The smartphone is then powered by a low-end MediaTek Helio A22 CPU along with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD card).
While on the photography side, the handset features a 13MP main rear camera with LED flash and f/2.2 aperture paired with 2MP secondary camera. On the front we instead find a single 5MP front-facing camera with f/2.4 aperture.
Finally, Nokia’s 2.3 is powered by a 4000mAh capacity battery and runs Android 9.0 OTB (upgradable to Android 10).

WhatsApp has changed the way we communicate with each other. Nowadays, it would be very complicated to carry out the daily activities of our life without the messaging applications. Groups of friends, work chats, favorite contacts …
On this occasion, we want to talk about one of the novelties that a lot of users had been asking for in the last months. Yes, call waiting is already a reality with the latest WhatsApp update for Android. From now on we can put on hold the calls we receive through the app. Although this system has some limitations. We tell you all the details below.
WhatsApp calls are a very useful feature. From the messaging app, you can call any of the contacts for free with the mere fact of pressing a button. Everything works through the Internet, so phone carriers have nothing to do with these types of procedures. However, if someone called us at the same time we made a call. We could not find out until we hung up.
With the latest version for Android (v2.19.352) everything changes since WhatsApp have decided to include calls on hold. From now on, when someone calls us while we are making a call, the notification appears in real-time. A system similar to the one we can see in traditional calls that has two options: Reject or End and accept.
As can be seen in the screenshots, this system does not perform the functions that we all know as “call waiting”. It is clear that you cannot pause a call to carry out the next one and then return to the previous call. But at least we can know at the moment if the incoming call is more important than the one we are making.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Maps Incognito mode comes to iOS, Android adding bulk Timeline delete</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In recent months, Google has added a number of privacy controlling features to Maps. The latest sees Incognito mode come to Google Maps for iOS, while Android picks up the ability to bulk delete logged locations in Timeline.
Originally debuting in Google Chrome, Incognito mode is high-profile branding that’s easily recognizable. In Maps, places you search for and navigate to won’t be saved to your Google Account with Location History not seeing any updates.
Additionally, personalized features like saved locations in Maps and restaurant recommendations will not appear. You’ll essentially be using Google Maps as if you’re temporarily signed out of your account.
Google Maps Incognito mode for iOS can be accessed by tapping your profile avatar in the top-right corner of the screen. A dialog will provide a summary of what’s changing on initial usage, and it’s rolling out starting today. The Android feature became widely available last month.
Meanwhile, the Timeline that displays your Location History in a concise view is getting bulk deletion next month on Android. This builds on the ability to auto-delete data older than three or 18 months.
With the introducing of these tools, Google today is also laying out the case for why location data is useful. In Maps, it powers aggregated wait times and the crowdedness graph, parking indicators, time-to-leave notifications, the Your match score, and the Explore tab.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: Tech21’s ‘Made for Google’ Pixel 4 accessories are a bit of a mixed bag</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you picked up a Pixel 4 over the holiday sales and you’re looking for a case to go with it, products with the “Made for Google” badge are a great place to start. Tech21 is one of the biggest names in that collection, and over the past couple of weeks I’ve spent some time with the company’s Pixel 4 XL accessories.
First and foremost, there’s Tech21’s signature case, the Evo Check. This somewhat thick plastic case is grippy, comfortable, and most importantly very protective. The case is rated for a 12-foot drop with a thick border around the sides of the phone, full protection along the back, and a raised lip to help protect the screen. The entire case is antimicrobial, too, which means it will stay much cleaner than other cases.
In testing out the Evo Check for Pixel 4 XL, I found that it’s still a pretty sweet case. The buttons feel solid and the cutouts for the speaker and USB-C port are pretty much perfect. The camera cutout on the back is a little off, though. So far, only Google’s Fabric case has been perfect for me.
Perhaps the biggest benefit to Tech21’s Evo Check for Pixel 4 is that it comes in multiple colors and with customizable buttons. I spent my time with the bright “Could by Coral” version — although, in hindsight, “Indigo” would have looked way better with my white Pixel — and it shipped with coral, yellow, and blue buttons. I swapped out the coral for the blue. The process of removing the buttons is a pain, but it’s great that you get the option.
Evo Check costs $39.99, which isn’t cheap, but it’s a great case overall that I wouldn’t regret spending the money on.
My favorite of the two cases from Tech21 was the Studio Colour. I picked up the “Let Off Steam” version of this case, which is a slightly blue shade of gray. It’s basic but unique. As a side note to Tech21, I need that “Life on Mars” color found on the iPhone’s version of the case on Pixel immediately.
The Studio Colour caught my eye primarily because it’s not made from plastic like most cases are. Instead, Tech21 uses plant-based materials to craft this Pixel 4 case. This results in buttons that are a bit stiff, but the overall case feels uncompromised from the material choice. Cutouts are mostly perfect, aside from the camera which, again, is a bit off.
The slim design of the Studio Colour also felt great. The case itself is a bit stiff, which makes the overall thin profile feel safer and less prone to any damage.
Studio Colour costs $29, and it’s well worth the money if you like the colors it offers.
Screen protectors are, in my opinion, a necessary evil. They’re almost always worse-feeling or looking than the glass on your phone, but I’d rather deal with that than shell out for a screen repair or a new phone entirely.
Tech21’s Impact Shield screen protector looks good at first glance online, but I can’t stress enough that you should not spend your money on this product.
The Impact Shield is a plastic screen protector which the company says is scratch-resistant, self-healing, and “easy to apply.” Those first two points may be true — I frankly couldn’t use the product long enough to test — but even if so, they’re overshadowed by a plethora of negatives.
Most importantly, this screen protector doesn’t actually cover the entire display. It only goes up to the top bezel, leaving a good portion of the glass completely uncovered. This is something you can’t know for sure based on the company’slistings.
The screen protector itself also seems to have absolutely no oleophobic coating, which means smudges appear almost instantly and are hard to get off.
The installation process may be the most flawed portion of this product, though. Tech21’s packaging makes the instructions a bit hard to find, and you won’t find any dust removal stickers or wet wipes to help clean off the display. The included microfiber cloth also left my display with more dust attached than before I wiped it down.
The plastic installation guide piece also leaves far too much room for error, which left me with a misaligned screen protector. Part of that alignment is definitely on my own user error, but the guide piece is far worse than similar installation methods I’ve used for similar screen protectors.
I could go on a bit more about what’s wrong with the Impact Shield, but I think I’ve made my point. You should not buy this screen protector, especially for $29. There are way better options out there for much less money.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ARCore phones can now detect depth with a single camera</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ARCore is Google’s platform for augmented reality available to Android and iOS apps. To allow for more immersive experiences, a new ARCore Depth API allows any compatible phone to create depth maps from a single camera.
One principle that makes AR more realistic is occlusion, or the “ability for digital objects to accurately appear in front of or behind real-world objects.” It lets applications make sure objects are not just floating in space or placed in a physically impossible position. This is particularly useful for making apps that let you demo furniture in your living room more realistic.
The example below is an updated version of AR animals in Google Search. The cat — with its hind legs hidden — appears behind the furniture instead of just standing in front of wherever you point the camera. It’s treating the background as being 3D with depth, not just as a flat surface. This more realistic experience will begin rolling out to some of the 200 million ARCore-enabled Android devices with the Google app today.
“Having a 3D understanding of the world” makes possible a number of other use cases. Google has explored (examples below) realistic physics, path planning, and surface interaction with ARCore’s new depth capability.
This one lens approach lowers the barrier to the technology by not requiring specialized cameras and sensors. That said, the Depth API will only improve with better hardware in phones. Google is letting developers collaborate on the new ARCore Depth API today.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Play Movies may soon add support for Dolby Vision HDR content</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Play Movies is a fine way to buy and watch digital movies, but it’s long lacked support for Dolby Vision HDR. According to some code behind the scenes, it looks like that may be coming down the road.
The folks at XDA-Developers dug into Google Play Movies v4.17.22 which has some revealing strings hidden within. According to the strings, Google Play Movies may soon support Dolby Vision content to some extent, but there’s not much information available here.
If Play Movies were to add support for Dolby’s proprietary format, it would arrive in addition to HDR10, which has been available for some time now. Dolby Vision typically offers a bit higher peak brightness from the picture with a bit more dynamic range, too. Of course, you’ll have to have a compatible TV or set-top box to take advantage of the format. Nvidia’s new Shield TV, for example, supports Dolby Vision HDR.
It’s totally unclear when Google plans to make this support available to Play Movies owners, but it’s probably a safe bet that compatible movies will be upgraded for free.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Fit is a pretty basic health/fitness suite, but it’s more than enough for many users. If you happen to own a Withings fitness watch, the latest update for the app is bringing support for syncing your sleep data with Google Fit.
The latest app update from Withings which is now available on Google Play (via Android Police) brings along with it a handful of upgrades. One of those is support for a dark theme in the app which comes alongside better overall support for Android 10. And, yes, it supports the system-wide toggle too.
More importantly, though, this update is also bringing support for Withings users to export their sleep data to Google Fit. This is in addition to Fit support for activity, daily steps, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure too. Withings is also enabling Strava integration with this update as well.
The full changelog for the update is available below and the Withings Health Mate app is on Google Play.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Calendar app gaining ability to move events between calendars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you have multiple calendars on your Google Calendar app on your phone, then you’ll know the pain of not being able to move events between calendars.
Not having to head to the web to move items between your work and personal calendars on Google Calendar might be a huge deal to some of you out there, especially if you’re getting notifications for items of no personal significance on a regular basis.
The feature appears to be rolling out now, with Google flipping the switch via a server-side update (via Android Police). It definitely saves some time, as until now, you would have to duplicate calendar events, then delete when you’d replicated them in your alternate calendar account.
Once the functionality reaches your Google Calendar app, you will be able to move events, thanks to a new option that will appear below the appointment title. Tapping will let you move it to any account currently signed in on your device.
Associated Press notes that you can force the new feature by stopping the app from running, and then clearing the app cache — although this is no guarantee that you’ll see it on your device. I’ve not been able to replicate it on my own Pixel 4 XL or Pixel 3a XL via this method.
It’s also worth noting that the Google Calendar move events feature seems to be enabled via a server-side update, so grabbing the most recent build of the app may not help. However, if you have noticed it on your device, let us know which build version you have down in the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Update: More countries] Google is sending out 20% Google Store discount codes to Local Guides in the UK</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Local Guides program is a great way for Google to encourage people to contribute to Google Maps with reviews, photos, and more. As a thank you, some Local Guide contributors are now receiving 20% discount codes for purchases made on the Google Store right in time for the holidays.
Emails are now heading out to those that have made contributions throughout 2019. It’s not clear just what is required to get the discount codes but the email notes “recent contributions” being a determining factor. There are some other Local Guides over on Reddit stating that they too received the email coupon, but without further details.
[Update]: It appears that the coupons are not just limited to Local Guides based in the UK, with more report coming in from Germany (via @vermutlichJ) and Spain (via @naitsirctr). We’re hoping to see more Local Guides get the coupon globally.
Having received the email, I can confirm that I am a Level 6 Local Guide but as an irregular contributor, it’s not clear what I’ve done to receive the discount code for the Google Store. However, it’s a nice little bonus for those of us in the UK that don’t necessarily get the best deals over the Black Friday-Cyber Monday weekend.
The only downside is that these discount codes can’t be used to knock money off the price of a new Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Google Stadia plan, or Nest Aware subscription. That’s a little disappointing but you can still save money on all other products on the store, including Nest WiFi, Nest Hub Max, and more.
All Local Guides discount codes are set to expire on December 13, so you’ll need to be quick if you were thinking of making a purchase ahead of the holiday rush. If you too received the same email, let us know in the comment section down below. Unfortunately, the coupons look as though they are only being sent out to UK Local Guides right now.
