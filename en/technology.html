    <h5 class="mb-1">TikTok’s Biggest Hits of the Year — and Its Predictions for 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TikTok has released the TikTok 100, a year-in-review list that names the top videos, genres, creators and memes that shaped the fastest-growing platform of the past year. The list highlights popular TikToks in topic areas like beauty and style, sports, pets and dance trends.
The most viral videos on the app included a science experiment conducted by YouTube star David Dobrik, a man doing surgery on a banana and a swimming pool stunt gone terribly wrong. Top memes on the app included #TikTokChecks (a format where users show off locations or objects as markers of their identity), VSCO girls (a youthful subculture consisting of scrunchies, Hydro Flasks and environmentalism) and “walk a mile,” in which people create high-heeled shoes out of absurd objects in a riff on an Iggy Azalea song.
“The thing that continues to inspire me is how much diversity and amazing content there’s been on the app,” said Vanessa Pappas, the general manager of TikTok North America and Australia. She pointed to the breakout success of Lil Nas X and the impact the platform has had on the music industry as a highlight of this past year. “TikTok has become a hotbed of talent, and there’s so much discoverability on the platform that it can be used as this mechanism to discover new voices,” she said.
The list, which incorporates views, likes, shares and trends into its rankings, showcases TikTok’s power to generate conversation and drive meme culture. It also shows the app’s role in introducing an entirely new type of notoriety into the online attention economy: TikTok fame. Being “TikTok famous” is a mark of status for teenagers. Clubs have sprung up to help those seeking it; countless young people goof off in their bedrooms with their phones for hours, hoping for a hit.
TikTok fame is different from fame on other social platforms like YouTube, Twitter or Instagram. Because TikTok primarily serves viewers through its algorithm-driven feed, you don’t need a single follower on the app to have a video blow up. You just need to tap into the right trend, or do the right dance at the right time.
“There’s something really attainable about TikTok fame. Anyone can post a video and it can be seen by hundreds or millions of people,” said Ms. Pappas. From there, fame happens fast. TikTok creators on the TikTok 100 include Noen Eubanks, who made his first video a year ago in September and now has more than 7 million followers. Others include Chase Hudson, @ThisAintJay and Charli D’Amelio.
“When we think about TikTok it’s this mobile-first platform and there’s so many things about the format itself that speaks to meme culture,” Ms. Pappas said. “Anyone can have a viral moment. Often we see creators take a topic and put their own spin on it and it really does have this viral effect. Because TikTok tends to lower the barrier of entry, creation is really being democratized.”
As the platform continues to birth new creators, Ms. Pappas said helping them make money is something the company is thinking hard about. She previously worked at YouTube and is deeply familiar with the tensions that arise between those seeking to make a living on social platforms and the platforms themselves.
“Creators are such an important part of our ecosystem, and monetization is something we hear often,” Ms. Pappas said. “We’re at the beginning stages of exploring different models and ways we can connect creators with brands and opportunities. We recently rolled out TikTok’s creator marketplace that connects creators to brands. We’re definitely in that exploratory phase, but we’re focused on what ways we can best serve our creative community.”
Serving that community also means broadening what many would consider traditional creators or influencers. “The definition of ‘creator’ is changing,” Ms. Pappas said. “We’re seeing this next generation of creators being born in ways we haven’t seen previously. For me, what’s been interesting is that now anyone can become a creator. People are owning their own voice, not having to express a polished version of themselves. When you look at other platforms there’s different versions of yourself you’re putting out there, TikTok is about being yourself, warts and all, and this new generation of creators is really embracing that.”
It’s not likely that news will be the company’s future focus. “There are so many outlets to find breaking news, so I don’t see TikTok as being a place for that. We’re not a real-time platform,” Ms. Pappas said.
However, the app is becoming increasingly political. Young activists use TikTok to spread political messages; users of all ages have begun leveraging the platform to share opinions on issues surrounding the impeachment inquiry, Trump administration policies, the 2020 election and more.
Misinformation is something the company says it’s deeply concerned about heading into 2020. “I think as a platform of scale you can’t not think about these things today and there’s a level of responsibility we have to take on,” Ms. Pappas said. “We want to make sure we’re safeguarding our users from things like misinformation. We have a number of things we’re beefing up: our policies, ensuring we have expert moderators who know how to define that type of content, what is misinformation, and ensuring we have the technology in place to scan for things like coordinated abuse. We’re looking across the industry and looking at what we can learn from.”
Because TikTok is owned by Chinese tech conglomerate, Bytedance, the app has also faced charges of political censorship. According to The Washington Post, employees of TikTok in the U.S. were pressured to censor “culturally problematic” content that might offend the Chinese government.
“This is something that I want to wholeheartedly stress: We do not censor any content based on political sensitivities,” Ms. Pappas said. “Everything from the U.S. market is driven from the U.S. team. We have U.S. moderation team, our head of trust and safety is in the U.S., it’s a U.S.-led operation. We don’t do any type of censorship in that regard and wouldn’t even if we were asked.”
As TikTok continues to scale in the U.S., Ms. Pappas said American TikTok culture has already begun to affect international markets. “I think today’s list of the top 100 is a really good example of everything that’s resonating from the U.S. globally. We’ve seen effects that have gone viral in other markets, like green screen and TikTok text. It’s been great to see how those trends have gone across barriers.”
TikTok stars also are taking on the wider internet as they spread across platforms, racking up as many as millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram. Ms. Pappas has a goal that they don’t abandon the app for greener pastures. “Creators are really the heart and soul of the app,” she said. “We want to make sure we’re supporting them, they’re creating the amazing content people are coming to see every day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologizes for Christmas sweater depicting Santa with cocaine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(CNN) — Walmart is saying sorry for making available a Christmas sweater with an apparent drug reference.
The sweater featured an image of Santa Claus behind a table with three white lines that look similar to cocaine lines. Below the image is the phrase “Let it snow.” The Global News, a Canadian news organization, first reported the apology.
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” Walmart said in a statement on Saturday. “We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offence this may have caused.”
The sweater did not appear to be available as of Sunday night. Walmart declined to comment further on Sunday.
Third-party sellers are able to make products available on Walmart Marketplace — a portal on which Walmart can approve sellers to use its website.
Walmart has faced similar issues before. In 2017, the company apologized for an offensive slur used by a third-party seller in a product listing on its website.
And it’s not the first time this holiday season that a third-party seller has brought scrutiny to a major online retailer. Earlier in December, Amazon pulled Christmas ornaments showing the Auschwitz concentration camp. Images used showed the train tracks leading to the entrance of Auschwitz II-Birkenau and a number of scenes inside the camps, where around 1 million Jewish people are estimated to have been killed during World War II. Amazon removed the products when the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted about them.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Walmart Canada has issued an apology for selling a jumper on its site that appears to show Santa Claus doing cocaine.
The item of clothing shows Saint Nicholas sitting behind a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him, captioned with the slogan: “Let it snow.”
The product’s description on the Walmart Canada website stated: “We all know how snow works. It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.
“That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.”
A spokesperson for Walmart has apologised for the sale of the product, adding that it has been removed from the company’s Canadian website.
 
“These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,” the spokesperson told Global News.
“We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.”
The jumper was produced by clothing retailer Fun Wear.
Other items created by Fun Wear that are still available to purchase on Walmart’s Canadian site include a jumper depicting a mugshot of Santa Claus, a sweatshirt featuring an illustration of Santa engaged in a fight with a bear and a Chanukah sweatshirt designed with a menorah and captioned with the slogan: “Lit.”
Other items of clothing, including a sweatshirt that showed Father Christmas standing in front of a fireplace without his trousers on, have been removed from the Walmart Canada website.
A range of Christmas cards featuring the Virgin Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus recently sparked anger among members of the Christian community, who described them as “deeply offensive”.
One of the cards includes the caption: “Mary just needs to admit she slept with someone else.”
“It highlights a fundamental hypocrisy that Christianity is seen as fair game to mock, disparage and insult,” said James Mildred, communication manager of Christian Action Research and Education (CARE).
The Independent has contacted Walmart for comment.

Walmart Canada apologized after several adult-themed sweaters were posted for sale on its website, CNN reported. According to Global News, a Canadian news organization, one of the sweaters included Santa Claus and a drug reference.
One sweater depicts a wide-eyed Santa Claus and three lines of a white, powdery substances that are implied to be cocaine, the website reported. The shirt had the slogan "Let it snow" emblazoned on its front.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart apologises for Christmas jumper of Santa doing coke</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is universally accepted that holiday jumpers are generally quite ugly, cheeky or just a bit naughty.
However, one company got it wrong when they released a jumper that appears to have a design of Father Christmas doing cocaine.
Walmart Canada has issued an apology after being called out for selling the narcotics-inspired design on its website.
The jumper shows a very jolly Santa Claus, with wide pupils, sat in front of a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him.
He also seems to be holding something thin and white in his hand, which is potentially meant to resemble a straw.
‘We all know how snow works,’ the product description reads.
‘It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.
‘That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.’
Walmart has announced that the item, which is sold by a third party retailer called Fun Wear, has now been removed from its Canadian website.
‘These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,’ the spokesperson told Global News.
‘We have removed these products from our marketplace.
‘We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.’
Fun Wear still has other options available on the site, including a design of Santa Claus getting his mugshot at the North Pole police department.
If you haven’t picked up an outfit for Christmas Jumper Day yet, here are some fantastic patterns to choose from this year – from David Attenborough’s face to retro classics.
You can also make a statement this year, after PETA released a terrifying jumper that features a mutilated sheep.
Or just do like Scrooge and skip out altogether.
Metro.co.uk has contacted Walmart Canada for further comment.

The festive season is a busy time for Santa Claus. The whole world, one night, a f*ck-load of presents – how does he keep the energy up?
Well, if Walmart’s adult-themed yuletide jumpers are anything to go by, it isn’t thanks to milk and cookies. No no, Santa favours ‘quality, grade A, Colombian snow’.

Walmart Canada has now issued an apology after some controversial (and hilarious) sweaters were listed for sale on their website.
A Walmart spokesperson told Global News: 
Of all the jumpers, the highlight is one featuring a wide-eyed Father Christmas, sitting in front of three lines of a white substance – I’m guessing it’s not sugar.
Created by clothing company FUN Wear, and called the ‘Let It Snow Ugly Christmas Sweater’, it had Twitter users in stitches.

The product description, now taken down from the website, read: 
While some weren’t exactly pleased about this narcotics-loving Santa, others loved it. One Twitter user wrote: ‘This is the best ugly Christmas sweater copy ever written.’
There were other jumpers too: one featured St. Nick ‘roasting his chesnuts on an open fire’, another saw Santa lying on a table with his pants down as an alien prepares to probe him.

The product description for the latter read: 
We all love a bit of fun around Christmas, but you need to draw the line somewhere.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel creates chip to control quantum computers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Quantum computers aim to carry out tasks in just a few minutes that would take today’s best conventional computers thousands of years. But in nearly every photograph of the devices, there’s a tangle of wires in the background connected to equipment that controls the quantum computer.
Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Monday announced a chip that it hopes will change that. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker announced a chip called “Horse Ridge” that is designed to take all the work being done by the wires and shrink it down to a chip and electronics about the size of a tea cup saucer.
Quantum computers remain years away from everyday use but have drawn the interest of major technology companies. In October, researchers at Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google said they had created a machine that can outpace conventional computers. Other major technology firms such as International Business Machines (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are also pursuing the technology.
Intel has two quantum efforts, each examining a different way of building the core of a quantum computer. That central part of a quantum machine uses what are known as “qubits.”
In many quantum computers, the qubits must be kept very cold, near the temperatures where atoms stop moving, inside a special refrigerator. That makes it very difficult to connect wires to the qubits to send and receive information. Most of those wires and additional electronics have to sit outside the special refrigerator.
Intel said its chip - which is named for one of the coldest spots in the U.S. state of Oregon, where many of its factories are located - is designed to be able to sit inside the quantum refrigerator. The company hopes the chip will make its quantum computers more practical to produce in the future.
“Intel recognized that quantum controls were an essential piece of the puzzle we needed to solve in order to develop a large-scale commercial quantum system,” Jim Clarke, Intel’s director of quantum hardware, said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Making Pixel more helpful with the first Pixel feature drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Your phone should get better over time. Your Pixel automatically updates regularly with fixes and improvements. Now, your Pixel will also get bigger updates in new Pixel feature drops.  Our first one, coming this month, includes a new way to capture portraits, easier Duo calls and automatic call screening. 
Now, you can turn a photo into a portrait on Pixel by blurring the background post-snap. So whether you took the photo years ago, or you forgot to turn on portrait mode, you can easily give each picture an artistic look with Portrait Blur in Google Photos. 
With our latest update to Call Screen on Pixel 4 in the US, the Google Assistant now helps you automatically screen unknown callers and filter out detected robocalls before your phone ever rings, so you’re not interrupted by them. And when it’s not a robocall, your phone rings a few moments later with helpful context about who is calling and why. Call Screen works on your device and does not use Wi-Fi or data, which makes the screening fast and the content private to you.
Video calls are better on Pixel 4 with new Duo features that let you focus on conversations instead of logistics. Auto-framing keeps your face centered during your Duo video calls, even as you move around, thanks to Pixel 4’s wide-angle lens. And if another person joins you in the shot, the camera automatically adjusts to keep both of you in the frame.
Now, the playback on your Duo calls is even smoother, too. When a bad connection leads to spotty audio, a machine learning model on your Pixel 4 predicts the likely next sound and helps you to keep the conversation going with minimum disruptions. Pixel 4’s Smooth Display also reduces choppiness on your video feed, refreshing up to 90 times a second.
When you make Duo video calls on Pixel 2, 3 and 4, you can now apply a portrait filter as well. You’ll look sharper against the gentle blur of your background, while the busy office or messy bedroom behind you goes out of focus.
In addition to new features for Pixel 4, we’re also bringing new apps and features to Pixel 2, 3 and 3a:
In addition to these new experiences, all Pixel devices will also receive an update to its memory management in the feature drop. With this new enhancement, your phone proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more.
Pixel phones have always received monthly updates to improve performance and make your device safe. Now, feature drops will bring more helpful and fun features to users on a regular basis to continue to make your Pixel better than ever. 
These features are already rolling out, and will hit Pixel devices in the coming weeks. To get the new features, update to the latest version of Android and go to the Play Store to start downloading your updated apps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google announces new update with several new features for Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google today announced that it will be delivering new updates called “Pixel feature drops” for Pixel devices from now on. Until now, Google only released regular updates with fixes and improvements. The first Pixel feature drops releasing this month comes with several new features and improvements.
Portrait mode for all photos:
Google now allows you to turn any photo into a portrait on Pixel by blurring the background. Yes, this works for photos that you took years ago. Even when you forgot to take the photo on portrait mode, you can use this feature to add blur in Google Photos.
Avoid robocalls:
With the improved Call Screen feature on Pixel 4, your Pixel can automatically screen unknown callers and filter out detected robocalls before your phone ever rings. This new Call Screen feature works without using internet.
Improved Duo video calls:
New Auto-framing feature in Duo keeps your face centered during your video calls. When another person joins you in the shot, the camera will automatically adjust to keep both of you in the frame.
To make audio during video calls even better, machine learning model on your Pixel 4 predicts the likely next sound and helps you to keep the conversation going with minimum disruptions. When you make Duo video calls on Pixel 2, 3 and 4, you can now blur your background.
Better GPS accuracy:
Google now offers faster accuracy in Google Maps with improved on-device computing for much better location quality.
Better RAM management:
Google is improving the memory management in all Pixel devices. With this new update, your Pixel proactively compresses cached applications so that you can run multiple apps at the same time.
In addition to the above new features for Pixel 4, older Pixel devices (Pixel 2, 3 and 3a) will receive the following updates:
These new features will be coming to Pixel devices in the coming weeks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls and center your Duo videos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To keep its phones from steadily getting worse over time, Google plans to roll out bigger updates, called feature drops, to its Pixel devices. The first feature drop, rolling out this month, will bring the latest Call Screen features and improved Duo video calls to the Pixel 4. And even if you have a slightly older Pixel, the feature drop will let you add Portrait Blur to photos you've already taken.
The Pixel 4 will automatically screen robocalls using Call Screen. The feature will silently filter out junk calls. If it's not spam, you'll get a description of who's calling and why, so you can decide whether you want to answer. Because Call Screen works on the device, it won't use Wi-Fi or data.
Google is making a few changes to Duo calls, too. On the Pixel 4, Duo will keep you centered in the video frame as you chat. If another person joins you, the frame will automatically adjust to fit them in. If the connection is spotty, a machine learning model on the Pixel 4 will fill in the gaps, guessing which sound was cut out and filling it in, and to reduce video choppiness, Smooth Display will refresh up to 90 times per second.
Pixel 2, 3 and 4 models will also get a portrait filter in Duo, which will blur the background slightly to make you look sharper. You'll be able to apply a similar filter to photos, too. Whether you just took the picture or snapped it years ago, Pixel owners can now add the Portrait Blur in the Google Photos app.
The features are already rolling out, and they should arrive on Pixel devices in the coming weeks. Google plans to make feature drops a regular occurrence, but we don't know what other changes are in the pipeline.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google is adding a bunch of features to all supported Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today, Google announced some new features that are coming to supported Pixel phones, meaning the Pixel 2 or higher. The Mountain View company says that it thinks your phone should get better over time, so it's promising regular "feature drops".
First is the ability to add a portrait effect to existing photos. You'll be able to add the background blur to any photo, whether it's one you just took and forgot to turn on portrait mode, or one that you took years ago. Naturally, this will happen through Google Photos.
There's a new update for Call Screen that uses Google Assistant to filter out robocalls before the phone even rings. And if it turns out to not be a robocall, your phone will ring with more information on who is calling. This feature is actually still exclusive to the Pixel 4 series.
You'll also find improvements to video calls on Duo, such as auto-framing. Your phone will automatically center you in the video, and if someone in the room jumps behind you, it will reframe the shot. You'll also be able to use a portrait mode effect on your video calls, to blur your background. And finally, Google is promising better quality calls, using machine learning to fix choppy audio.
Google also noted a few other things, such as the availability of the Pixel 4's Recorder app on older devices. Live Caption is coming to the Pixel 3 series, Flip to Shhh is coming to Digital Wellbeing on the Pixel 2, and the Pixel 4 is getting the new Google Assistant in the UK, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and Australia. Google will also be releasing an update for all Pixel phones with improved memory management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Verizon kills email accounts of archivists trying to save Yahoo Groups history</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Verizon says the archivists it has blocked breached its terms of service.
Verizon, which bought Yahoo In 2017, has suspended email addresses of archivists who are trying to preserve 20 years of content that will be deleted permanently in a few weeks. 
As Verizon announced in October, the company intends to wipe all content from Yahoo Groups. As of December 14, all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed. The mass deletion includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, database, calendar, attachments, conversations, email updates, message digests, and message histories that was uploaded to Yahoo servers since pre-Google 1990s.SEE: How to build a successful developer career (free PDF)Verizon planned to allow users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, but apparently it has a problem with the work of The Archive Team who wants to save content to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site.  
"Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," reported the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. "Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups – which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."
News of the apparently aggressive move from Verizon was first reported on boingboing.net. The Yahoo Groups Archive Team argues that it is facing a near total "80% loss of data" because Verizon is blocking the team members' email accounts.    The Yahoo Groups site isn't widely used today but it was in the past. The size of the archive that the group is trying to save is substantial and the group had saved about 1.8 billion messages as of late 2018. According to the Archive Team: "As of 2019-10-16 the directory lists 5,619,351 groups. 2,752,112 of them have been discovered. 1,483,853 (54%) have public message archives with an estimated number of 2.1 billion messages (1,389 messages per group on average so far). 1.8 billion messages (86%) have been archived as of 2018-10-28."Verizon has issued a statement to the group supporting the Archive Team, telling concerned archivists that "the resources needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo Groups pages is cost-prohibitive, as they're largely unused".The telecoms giant also said the people booted from the service had violated its terms of service and suggested the number of users affected was small. "Regarding the 128 people who joined Yahoo Groups with the goal to archive them – are those people from Archiveteam.org? If so, their actions violated our Terms of Service. Because of this violation, we are unable reauthorize them," Verizon said."Also, moderators of Groups can ban users if they violate their Groups' terms, so previously banned members will be unable to download content from that Group. If you can send the user information, we can investigate the cause of lack of access." SEE: Yahoo announces all content on Yahoo Groups will be permanently removedAdditionally, Verizon mentioned that the email functionality of the platform will still continue to work, at least for members who haven't been expelled. "While users will no longer be able to post or upload content to the site, the email functionality exists. If you are having issues with this feature, please reach out to YahooGroupsEscalations@verizonmedia.com and we will work to fix the problem with any delay," the Verizon spokesperson wrote. ZDNet has contacted Verizon for comment and will update the story if it responds.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Verizon blocks archivists from preserving 20 years of Yahoo Groups history</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YAHOO OWNER Verizon has blocked the efforts of archivists to preserve almost two decades of history from Yahoo Groups.
Yahoo Groups is just days away from being defunct; the service stopped accepting new content from 28 October, with all scheduled to to be deleted from servers in just five days' time on 14 December.
Content destined for the digital graveyard includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, calendars, attachments, conversations, email updates and message history. 
Though long-neglected, Yahoo Groups still remains one of the biggest repositories of message boards in the world, which is why a group of volunteer archivers - the aptly-named Yahoo Groups Archive Team - is attempting to save all of the content from the service to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site.  
However, its attempts have been hampered by Verizon. While it's actively encouraging users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, the firm is banning the email addresses of the archivists, BoingBoing reports, putting 20 years worth of content at risk of being gone forever. 
"Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," said the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. 
"Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups - which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."
In a statement issued to the group, Verizon told the archivists that "the resources needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo Groups pages is cost-prohibitive, as they're largely unused".
The telecoms giant also said those it suspended from the service had violated its terms of service.
"Regarding the 128 people who joined Yahoo Groups with the goal to archive them - are those people from Archiveteam.org? If so, their actions violated our Terms of Service. Because of this violation, we are unable to reauthorize them," Verizon added.
"Also, moderators of Groups can ban users if they violate their Groups' terms, so previously banned members will be unable to download content from that Group. If you can send the user information, we can investigate the cause of lack of access." 
If Verizon doesn't quickly change its stance - and it doesn't look like it's going to - 20 years of Yahoo Groups data will be gone forever. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Verizon reportedly blocks archivists from Yahoo Groups days before deletion [update]</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An ad-hoc group scrambling to archive as much content as possible from Yahoo Groups ahead of the site's final demise next week is running into trouble as more than a hundred volunteer archivists say Yahoo's parent company, Verizon, has banned their accounts.
Yahoo Groups has been on the wane for years, but Verizon announced its official date of death two months ago. Users were blocked from uploading or posting new content to the site as of October 28, and all content currently on the site is slated to be deleted on December 14—less than one week from now.
Members of the Archive Team have been working rapidly to preserve content from as many groups as possible in that six-week time frame. The volunteers have been using "semi-automated" scripts to join groups rapidly and are using a third-party tool known as PGOffline to access messages, photos, and files not captured by Verizon/Yahoo's data download or export tool. They estimate that as a result of this weekend's blocks, they have now lost access to 80 percent of the material they were attempting to preserve.
One volunteer working on the effort shared a response she received from Verizon in a blog post yesterday. The Verizon representative said the 128 volunteers from Archiveteam.org, who joined groups with the intent of archiving them, were banned for violating the Verizon Media terms of service and would not be able to have their accounts reinstated.
"I understand your usage of groups is different from the majority of our users, and we understand your frustration," the Verizon employee added. "However, the resources needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo Groups pages is cost-prohibitive, as they’re largely unused."
This is not the first time Verizon and the Archive Team have butted heads. Almost exactly a year ago, members of the Archive Team working to preserve Tumblr content had their accounts banned. In that case, however, volunteers found their way around Verizon's block and continued their work within a day.
The Organization for Transformative Works—the nonprofit best known for running the decade-old, Hugo-winning fanfiction site Archive of Our Own—has joined the chorus calling on Verizon to postpone the deletion date by six months, until May 14, 2020, in order to allow volunteers to archive more material.
UPDATE: Late Monday night, Verizon told Ars it would be extending the deletion deadline to Friday, January 31, 2020 at 11:59pm Pacific time.
"We are amazed at the vibrant community Yahoo Groups has become, which is why we want to support our Groups users through the next phase of the transition by providing a way to download previously posted content," the spokesperson said. Individuals can use a Yahoo tool to download their content.
"On Sunday, December 15, 2019, the content will no longer be available or viewable from the groups.yahoo.com site, but we will not delete it until all requests submitted prior to the above deadline have been completed," the spokesperson added.
Archivists, however, will still be prohibited from using third-party tools to scrape any content from groups, and any who do will be blocked.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No matter what phone you use with Google Fi, our phone plan in the U.S., you’ll get great features—like reliable coverage, easy group plans and high speed international data coverage for the same rates you pay at home. 
We’ve been working to bring the Google Fi experience to more people across the U.S., and last year we expanded Fi plans to the majority of Android devices and iPhones. Today, we’re bringing some favorite Fi features to these devices.  
Spam call warnings and the ability to block specific numbers are now available on all phones compatible with Fi—including iPhone—so you don’t have to worry about unwanted calls.
Plus, we are extending our enhanced VPN network and WiFi calling to all Android phones on Fi. When you use our enhanced VPN network, all of your cellular and WiFi traffic are encrypted so you have peace of mind, knowing nobody else can see your online activity. And with WiFi calling, you can make and receive calls as long as you have a WiFi connection, even when you don’t have cellular coverage. 
To use these features, download the Google Fi app and then look for Phone Settings in the app.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Fi brings Wi-Fi calling, VPN, spam warnings to non-Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best Google Fi experience and full functionality is unsurprisingly on Pixel devices that the company has direct input over and access to during development. Today, the MVNO is bringing spam warnings, Wi-Fi calling, and other existing Fi features to non-Google Pixel phones.
As of last year, Google Fi is available for the “majority of Android devices and iPhones.” There is no network switching to take advantage of Sprint and US Cellular, so subscribers using non-Google phones are essentially just on T-Mobile.
Starting today, those Android devices and iPhones now have spam call warnings through their default phone application. Appearing on the incoming call screen, Fi will note “Suspected spam.” Both classes of devices also pick up the ability to block specific numbers.
Meanwhile, Google Fi’s VPN feature is now available for non-Pixel Android phones. All mobile and Wi-Fi traffic gets encrypted to make sure nobody is able to snoop on traffic. Google itself cannot find out what you’re browsing as the VPN is “designed so that your traffic isn’t tied to your Google account or phone number.”
Wi-Fi calling on Android lets you make and receive calls even when you don’t have cellular coverage. This is great for places without good signal, or to conserve data. To get these Google Fi non-Pixel features, update the companionapp and visit “Phone Settings.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Fi brings Wi-Fi calling to more phones, adds spam call warnings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of Google Fi’s big focuses over the last year has been bringing more devices into the fold. This time last year, Google Fi rebranded and expanded to support phones from Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Devices that aren’t “Designed for Fi” miss out on some features, such as network switching, but now Google is bringing some of those extras to more devices.
If you make a lot of phone calls at your house, you know how valuable Wi-Fi calling can be. Even if you live in a well-covered area, Wi-Fi- calling is often more reliable. Wi-Fi calling is a basic feature of Google Fi, but it has mostly been limited to “Designed for Fi” phones. Now, Google is expanding the feature to all Android phones on Google Fi.
On top of Wi-Fi calling, Google is bringing the enhanced VPN network to all Android phones on Fi as well. This is a feature that Google rolled out last year and it has a number of benefits. For starters, it allows the phone to switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data more seamlessly. It also encrypts all Wi-Fi and mobile traffic for added security.
Lastly, spam call warnings and the ability to block specific numbers are available on all phones compatible with Google Fi. If a caller is detected as spam, you will see the caller ID shows “Suspected spam,” and blocking a number works exactly how you’d expect. To find all of these new features, go into the Settings of the Google Fi app and look for “Phone Settings.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Apple TV remote is so bad that a Swiss TV company developed a normal replacement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The remote that comes bundled with the Apple TV is infamous for its difficult-to-use design and controversial touchpad for navigation. It’s so bad, in fact, that Swiss TV and internet provider Salt — which provides Apple TVs as the set-top boxes for its internet TV service — has developed a more traditional remote to replace Apple’s model, via MacRumors.
The optional remote (which costs 19.95 francs, or roughly $20.16) was reportedly developed in collaboration withApple due to complaints from users who were confused by Apple’s touchpad controls. Salt’s remote natively supports the Apple TV right out of the box, with no pairing or setup required — just like Apple’s remote. It also can control a TV set through IR controls, similar to other universal remotes.
But the most notable thing about the Salt remote is just how ordinary it is. There’s a regular four-way control pad for navigation. There are separate play / pause, forward, back, fast-forward, rewind, and stop buttons to control playback. There’s even a dedicated power button! The only thing missing is a Siri button and microphone for activating Apple’s digital assistant. (MacRumors speculates that this absence is due to the fact that Siri services aren’t offered in Switzerland.)
The real question is whether customers in other countries will be able to buy and use the Salt remote. With the reception of the current Apple design, a simpler, easier-to-use option sounds like it’d be welcome in places beyond Switzerland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Swiss broadband provider offers alternative remote control for your Apple TV</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Siri Remote’s been panned for usability issues. Although Apple sells the standard aluminum remote without a touch-sensitive surface, many folks dislike its minimalism. Small wonder that a Swiss provider, which goes by the name The Salt, has decided to offer its broadband subscribers an alternative Apple TV remote with additional buttons.
French blog iGeneration.fr notes that the Salt remote has a Menu button, a four-way directional pad, volume and playback controls, a Mute button, skip and forward buttons and more.
The 9to5Mac observed that to it wasn’t immediately clear from the report whether the remote uses infrared connectivity or takes advantage of the new HomeKit remote feature in tvOS 13. “The Salt remote does not include a microphone for Siri input which suggests its functionality could be supported by just infrared alone,” reads the post.
HomeKit-based remotes for the Apple TV with integrated touch controls and Siri support have been available from the likes of Crestron and Savant for some time now.
Don’t forget that the Apple TV operating software makes it easy to program any universal infrared remote so that you can navigate the entirety of the tvOS interface, and use apps, with the same remote that came with your TV, cable box or DVD/Blu-ray player.
TUTORIAL:How to use a universal infrared remote with your Apple TV
To help turn its Apple TV “hobby” into a viable product, the Cupertino tech giant has negotiated deals with broadband and IPTV providers around the world that permits those companies to offer the Apple-branded streaming device to their customers as a faux set-top box.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mac Pro is finally coming on December 10 — Apple's super-powerful computer that starts at a whopping $6,000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple's $6,000 professional-grade Mac Pro desktop will be available to order starting December 10. That's according to a notification sent to customers who signed up for more information about the Mac Pro through Apple's website, which YouTube personality and tech reviewer Marques Brownlee spotted.
Apple previously announced that the Mac Pro and the $5,000 Pro Display XDR it's selling to go along with it would be available in December, but hasn't revealed a specific date. The Mac Pro was initially expected to be released in the fall. 
 
The new Mac Pro is the long-awaited successor to the 2013-era Mac Pro, which had a cylindrical shape and wasn't very easy to upgrade. The company made significant changes with the refreshed model: it now features a modular design that makes it easy for customers to upgrade individual parts, fixing the primary criticism of the last model. There's also a handle on the top of the computer so that it can be more easily transported to different areas of the customer's workspace if necessary.
The Mac Pro, which Apple announced in June, is designed for professionals in need of a machine that can process heavy workloads rather than the average consumer. App and video game developers, video editors working in the film industry, and those with jobs that require heavy data analysis might be interested in the Mac Pro. 
The new computer will run on an Intel Xeon processor that's configurable up to 28 cores and an optional accelerator card called Apple Afterburner, which the company says can power three simultaneous streams of raw 8K video. It also allows for 1.5TB of memory, which Apple says is the most that's ever been available in a Mac.
When it comes to graphics, the Mac Pro's options start with the Radeon Pro 580X, but the company is also offering a new option called the Radeon Pro Vega II. With that GPU configuration, you'll get 14 teraflops of computing power and 32GB of memory. 
Apple's new Mac Pro has garnered attention in recent months for a different reason as well. The company announced in September that it would manufacture the new high-end computer in the United States at a plant in Austin, Texas, a decision that comes as the United States has been locked in a trade war with China that has resulted in tariffs being imposed on Chinese imports.
Much of Apple's supply chain is based in China, and CEO Tim Cook said on its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call in October that the company has already been paying tariffs on some products. President Trump recently toured the Texas facility where the new Mac Pro is being made, during which the president said he was "looking at" whether the company should be exempt from such tariffs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mac Pro is finally coming on December 10 — Apple's super-powerful computer that starts at a whopping $6,000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s $US6,000 professional-grade Mac Pro desktop will be available to order starting December 10. That’s according to a notification sent to customers, which YouTube personality and tech reviewer Marques Brownlee spotted.
Apple previously announced that the Mac Pro and the $US5,000 Pro Display XDR it’s selling to go along with it would be available in December, but hasn’t revealed a specific date. The Mac Pro was initially expected to be released in the fall.
The new Mac Pro is the long-awaited successor to the 2013-era Mac Pro, which had a cylindrical shape and wasn’t very easy to upgrade. The company made significant changes with the refreshed model: it now features a modular design that makes it easy for customers to upgrade individual parts, fixing the primary criticism of the last model. There’s also a handle on the top of the computer so that it can be more easily transported to different areas of the customer’s workspace if necessary.
The new computer will run on an Intel Xeon processor that’s configurable up to 28 cores and an optional accelerator card called Apple Afterburner, which the company says can power three simultaneous streams of raw 8K video.
Apple’s new Mac Pro has garnered attention in recent months for a different reason as well. The company announced in September that it would manufacture the new high-end computer in the United States at a plant in Austin, Texas, a decision that comes as the United States has been locked in a trade war with China that has resulted in tariffs being imposed on Chinese imports.
Much of Apple’s supply chain is based in China, and CEO Tim Cook said on its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call in October that the company has already been paying tariffs on some products.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight attendants explain the ways you could actually bag a flight upgrade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Booking an economy seat on a flight and landing a fee upgrade to business class or first class is the holy grail of travel.
Unsurprisingly it doesn't happen very often, but the good news is that there are ways you can put the odds in your favour - and now members of cabin crew have revealed just how to do it.
International travel money specialists Equals teamed up with a host of flight attendants and asked them just what it takes to land that coveted upgrade.
Their advice? If you're going to try and blag an upgrade, ask at the check-in desk.
One flight attendant, who works at British Airways, explained: "Some people ask the crew at the door of the aircraft for an upgrade, and some even bring us sweets thinking it will help get them what they want.
"We do get a lot of people asking for a free upgrade, especially if it’s their birthday – but there’s nothing we can do so your best bet is to ask at the desk when you’re checking in."
Asking at the check-in desk doesn't mean you'll get a free upgrade, but it could still land you a cheaper rate if you want to move up to business class.
One cabin crew who works for Virgin Atlantic on long-haul routes said: "Sadly nowadays [getting a free upgrade] is virtually impossible unless you pay for the upgrade as they sell the spare seats at check in. But it’s normally cheaper at check-in so worth a gamble as you could get a good deal."
Joining airlines' loyalty programmes could be another money-saving trick for getting a business class seat without the hefty price tag. These are usually free to join, and mean you can make the most of rewards such as air miles.
A member of Air France's cabin crew revealed: "Passengers can sometimes get themselves into business or first class for less than the normal price, but it depends on how busy the aircraft is. If you have air miles you could try using them to get an upgrade."
Didn't bag the upgrade? That doesn't mean you can't enjoy some luxury - in fact, there are plenty of in-flight extras most people don't think to ask for, but these can actually turn your economy flight into a first class experience.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A lucky UK punter who won £40m in the EuroMillions has still not come forward to collect the life-changing prize.
Whoever won the jackpot in Tuesday’s 3 December EuroMillions draw, may not have even realised they’re a multi-millionaire yet.
The search is on to find the owner of the winning ticket, who matched all five main numbers and two Lucky Stars in the EuroMillions draw last Tuesday.
The winning EuroMillions numbers on that date were 18, 31, 32, 38 and 48, with the Lucky Stars 4 and 12.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PlayStation 5 Pro could launch in 2023, Sony executive hints</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PlayStation 5 is one of the most highly-anticapted gaming consoles in history, and now it seems that Sony is already looking ahead to a follow-up console.
A new report by LetsGoDigital suggests that Sony is already working on the PlayStation 5 Pro.
The report points to a recent interview with GameInformer, in which Sony executive Masayasu Ito indicated that the PS5 Pro is in development.
He said: “In the past, the cycle for a new platform was 7 to 10 years, but in view of the very rapid development and evolution of technology, it's really a six to seven year platform cycle. Then we cannot fully catch up with the rapid development of the technology, therefore our thinking is that as far as a platform is concerned for the PS5, it is a cycle or maybe six to seven years.
“But doing that, a platform lifecycle, we should be able to change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancements in technology.
"That was the thinking behind it and the test case of that thinking was the PS4 Pro that was launched in the midway of the PS4 launch cycle.”
Based on Mr Ito’s statement, LetsGoDigital claims that the PS5 Pro is likely to launch in 2023.
It said: “From this statement it can be concluded that the PS4 Pro was a test case. This advanced console with improved hardware components was introduced three years after the PS4.
“We now know that the release of the PlayStation 4 Pro has become a huge success for Sony. And so the company has reason enough to repeat this marketing strategy.
“Since the PS5 will have a life cycle of around 6 to 7 years, it is likely that the PS5 Pro will be announced in 2023.”
As with all rumours, Sony is remaining tight-lipped, so we’ll just have to wait and see if they’re true!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google adds robocall screening and more to the Pixel 4 in first ‘feature drop’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google plans to start regularly releasing “feature drops” for its Pixel phones, bringing a number of new features to its phones all at once. The first starts rolling out today with a number of updates, including robocall screening and new portrait mode features. There’s also a memory management update that might be a big deal for Pixel 3 owners who have long complained about how the phone handles multitasking.
Perhaps the standout update is an automatic robocall screening feature that’s exclusive to Pixel 4 owners. Google’s phones already have a feature that lets you manually screen calls using its voice assistant, but the feature is now being updated to automatically decline detected robocalls. It looks like the feature will also start automaticallyscreening calls from unknown numbers, then ringing once it has an initial transcript from the person calling. That choice might be a little more controversial than simply swatting away spam, so hopefully Google offers some options on how you want it to work.
Google Photos is also getting a pretty notable portrait mode update: the app can now apply a portrait mode effect to seemingly any photo of a person, even if you never enabled portrait mode while shooting. We’ll have to see just how good that effect turns out since it’s all being done with AI, rather than actual depth data. But there’s no reason Google can’t deliver something as entirely adequate as a typical portrait mode shot with this method, given how filtered they already look.
As part of the “feature drop,” Google is also announcing new video framing effects and quality improvements for Duo video chats, highlighting the expansion of the Recorder app to the Pixel 2, 3, and 3A, Live Caption to the 3 and 3A, and rolling out some Digital Wellbeing updates.
Google also says it’s updating “memory management” on all Pixel devices. Pixel phones will now “proactively compress” background apps, supposedly leading to multitasking improvements. Google says the feature allows Pixels to “run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more,” which is kind of confusing because that is how all smartphones work and a thing Pixels are currently capable of doing... just not very well in all cases.
The Pixel 3, in particular, has been criticized by owners for being overly aggressive about shutting down apps in the background. Google has previously released updates to tweak how the phone handles memory management, but there’s only so much Google can do with the device’s 4GB of RAM.
Google doesn’t say how often feature drops will come along, but it says they’ll be a regular event. The new features are rolling out now and are supposed to hit all phones they’re offered on within “the coming weeks.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US, like China, has about one surveillance camera for every four people, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One billion surveillance cameras will be deployed globally by 2021, according to data compiled by IHS Markit and first reportedby The Wall Street Journal. China’s installed base is expected to rise to over 560 million cameras by 2021, representing the largest share of surveillance devices installed globally, with the US rising to around 85 million cameras. When taking populations into account, however, China will continue to have nearly the same ratio of cameras to citizens as the US.
In 2018, China had 350 million cameras installed for an estimated one camera for every 4.1 people. That compared to one for every 4.6 people in the US where 70 million cameras were installed. Taiwan was third in terms of penetration with one camera for every 5.5 citizens in 2018, followed by the UK and Ireland (1:6.5) and Singapore (1:7.1).
China’s installed base of cameras has recently risen 70 percent, while the US increased by nearly 50 percent.
“During the past few years, coverage of the surveillance market has focused heavily on China’s massive deployments of cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) technology,” said IHS Markit analyst Oliver Philippou. “What’s received far less attention is the high level of penetration of surveillance cameras in the United States. With the US nearly on par with China in terms of camera penetration, future debate over mass surveillance is likely to concern America as much as China.”
There is a difference in how the cameras are implemented, though. In China, most cameras are installed for the purposes of widespread video surveillance of cities, whereas cameras installed in the US are primarily for the purposes of retail and commercial usage. Notably, the Chinese government is reportedly using cameras with facial recognition to profile and track members of Muslim minority groups, a million or more of whom are being rounded up and detained in indoctrination camps.
US cities are split currently on how to deal with facial recognition. As reported by the WSJ, cities like Detroit; Washington, DC; and Orlando are testing it for policing and security, while others, like San Francisco, have officially banned it. IHS Markit says only 3 percent of security cameras installed in the US are for the purposes of city-wide surveillance.
“It should also be noted that while the USA does have a high penetration rate, this installed base has been developed over many years, whereas the Chinese market has developed very quickly over the last decade,” according to Philippou.

The new update will enable cross-platform play between the Xbox One, Windows 10 PCs, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, Gear VR, and now PS4. Minecraft players on the PS4 will also get access to all of their purchases and progress, and the update will be available free of charge.
Microsoft is starting to roll out the Bedrock Edition to PS4 just months after Sony brought its PS4 cross-play support officially out of beta. It also comes two years after cross-play was available for Minecraft on Xbox, PC, mobile, and the Switch. Sony previously blocked cross-play for titles like Minecraft and Fortnite, and after significant Fortnite backlash, the company eventually backed down and changed its policies in September 2018. Since then, Fortnite, Rocket League, PUBG, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare have all included cross-play.
“One of Minecraft’s core missions is to connect players across devices and provide the best experience regardless of platform,” says Minecraft studio head Helen Chiang, in a statement to The Verge. “We continue to fulfill that mission here today by welcoming PS4 players to Minecraft on Bedrock and growing our cross-platform multiplayer community.”
Minecraft is a significant addition to the list of cross-play games, given that there are 480 million players, with 112 million monthly active players. Minecraft was also recently featured in YouTube Rewind 2019, listed above Fortnite as the most viewed video game on YouTube.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many popular headphone models, including Apple’s AirPods, Sony’s WH-1000XM3, and Beats Studio 3, were cheaper than usual during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The latest model of Bose’s flagship wireless noise-canceling headphones, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, were missing from the festivities, but you can now get them for $50 off through Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.
The $50 off brings the total cost of the headphones down to $349. That may not sound like much, but it’s the biggest price drop that we’ve seen on this new model yet. According to The Verge’s Chris Welch, these offer some great features that you won’t find on any other set of cans. Highlights include USB-C charging, but more importantly, voice calls are fantastic. The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth, and the noise cancellation effect is (unsurprisingly) great. This model currently sits atop the rest in our ranking of the best wireless headphones.
Usually, Beats, Bose, and Sony headphones stubbornly hang on to their retail price for quite a while, so if you’ve been waiting for a price reduction for 2019’s finest over-ear wireless headphones, now is your moment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk drove the controversial Tesla Cybertruck near Los Angeles 2 years before its planned release</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla CEO Elon Musk drove the electric-car maker's Cybertruck near Los Angeles on Saturday, TMZ reported. Another video posted on YouTube shows the Cybertruck driving on the 405 Freeway that night, though Musk is not visible.
Photos and videos from TMZ show Musk in the vehicle at the restaurant Nobu. The musician Grimes, who according to media reports has been dating Musk, appears to be one of the vehicle's passengers.
When leaving the restaurant, Musk appeared to disobey and knock down a sign instructing drivers to make only right turns while making a left turn. The sign appeared to have been posted by Nobu, rather than a government agency. 
A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the maneuver.
Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck in November, saying production for models intended for customers would begin in late 2021. While the vehicle's design has been divisive, it has received at least 250,000 refundable $100 preorders, and its listed performance specs top those of the 2020 Ford F-150 in areas like maximum payload and towing capacity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GitHub keen to open subsidiary in China</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GitHub, the world’s biggest software development platform, is looking to open a subsidiary in China, as the Chinese government tries to protect its access to key technology from further US sanctions.
Erica Brescia, GitHub’s chief operating officer, said in an interview with the Financial Times that Beijing was “very encouraging” of the company’s plans to expand in China.
GitHub, which was bought for $7.5bn last year by Microsoft, hosts and manages software development for private companies and is the biggest host of open-source software projects that anyone can take part in.
Ms Brescia said the company was planning a “phased approach”, first looking into setting up a wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China for the purposes of hiring staff, starting with a general manager. After that, the company might explore joint ventures and the possibility of hosting GitHub content in China.
Chinese developers are concerned that they could lose access to GitHub if Washington extends its export sanctions. Some point to the decision taken by GitHub in July to restrict accounts of users in some US-sanctioned countries, such as Cuba and Iran, as a foreboding of what could happen to them. The company has said it would lobby US regulators to prevent the expansion of export controls.
Ms Brescia said the Chinese government was keen for domestic developers to engage more with open-source software to hedge against the risk of being cut off from US-developed software as trade tensions continue. Since open-source software is publicly and freely available for us, it is exempt from US sanctions.
Without GitHub, Chinese companies would lose access to the code of open-source software, leaving their programs stuck in the past.
Some open-source software is critical to the internet; Apache’s open-source web server software, for example, is used to run one-third of all websites, and its development is supported by a US-based foundation.
“What [government ministries] told us is, they believe that open-source is a great way to build on the innovation of others, but obviously it gives more of a sense of security because it’s not subject to any trade restrictions in the US,” Ms Brescia said on the sidelines of the company’s first community event in Beijing.
“I think there has been a strategic push in China around open-source in general because it gives you a way to connect with the rest of the development world, without building on proprietary technologies,” she said, adding that the company had met officials from the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which regulates the telecoms industry, as well as the Ministry of Public Security, which runs the police force.
While other foreign tech companies have found their platforms blocked from Chinese users, GitHub has remained accessible. Earlier this year Chinese developers took advantage of the platform’s lack of censorship to organise a workers’ rights campaign against long hours which is still hosted on the platform.
The company publicly posts government takedown notices, saying it does so “to document their potential to chill speech”.
So far such notices have come from Spain, Russia and China. All five notices from China received this year were requests from the MPS to take down content related to Falun Gong, a religious group that has been harshly repressed in China.
Ms Brescia admitted that the company faced a potential challenge in both defending its transparency standards and building out a team in China, if the Chinese government were to change its stance towards the takedown notices.
“Ideally we will continue to operate in the same way we always have. If we can’t, that’s going to involve a pretty involved discussion. It’s core to who we are that we operate with that level of transparency,” said Ms Brescia.
Beijing is also trying to develop its own open-source projects. Earlier this year Huawei, who is currently blocked from most of its US suppliers, announced it was combining forces with the government and other domestic tech giants to set up a foundation to stimulate open-source software development at home.
“If China doesn’t have its own open-source community to maintain [open-source] code, all of China’s software industry is at great risk,” Wang Chenglu, Huawei’s director of software, said at the company’s developer conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brussels asks news groups to describe their data deals with Google</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The European Commission has sent detailed questionnaires to news publishers as it tries to understand whether the way Google collects data from their websites allows it to stifle competition in online advertising.
The questionnaire, seen by the Financial Times, asks news publishers to explain how Google tracks user activity and browsing data from their sites in order to subsequently personalise adverts.
“Describe any agreements . . . based on which Google collects data from your company or is allowed to obtain data from users of your websites or apps,” said one question, asking the publishers to describe the scope, duration and rationale for their deals with Google.
The questions also ask whether Google provides any technical support or compensation in exchange for the data.
In a sign of how the commission’s antitrust investigators are trying to shape a case against Google, the questions focus on whether the internet company is using its dominance to force publishers into sharing data, and whether that data is then repackaged and sold on by Google to third parties, giving any of its advertising clients the same information that news websites have about their readers.
The questions also examine whether data from news publishers is aggregated into Google’s overall profiles, giving the search group an ever greater advantage in how it can tailor adverts.
The questions to publishers are part of a wider look by the commission at the implications for competition of Google and Facebook’s data collection practices, announced just days after Margrethe Vestager started a second five-year mandate as competition commissioner.
So far, investigations into the use of data have largely focused on the privacy of end users. Respondents have until January 15 to send their replies.
Publishers have long complained that Google has abused its market power, both in how it presents search results for news and in the way it runs its digital advertising business.
In a recent policy paper sent to Ms Vestager, the European Publishers’ Council calling for an investigation into how Google and Facebook use “the troves of data collected across their properties through pervasive user surveillance to dominate search and (social) display advertising respectively”.
The publishers argue Google, through control of data, has an indispensable position on both the buy-side and the sell-side of the digital advertising market. “This creates a situation whereby the dynamics by which auctions are run are unclear; data from those auctions is inconsistent and patchy and where Google is positioned to act in a way that enables it to both prioritise its own inventory, and outbid its rivals,” the EPC argued in its paper.
Antitrust lawyers expect the probes will lead to new cases being opened against Google in Brussels and may influence tougher rules on how Big Tech should treat data when it comes to its agreements with rivals.
The questionnaire also focuses on how news websites themselves collect and use different types of data.
“Please explain how your company collects data from users ( . . . ) data you collect when users are setting up accounts on your websites/apps, when they are signing in for a newsletter,” reads one of the questions.
The European Commission declined to comment on the questions sent to the news groups on Friday.
But in the past, the commission has said that questionnaires on the search company’s collection and use of data constitute part of an ongoing preliminary investigation.
Google declined to comment but has noted previously that publishers around the world made more than $14bn using advertising tools provided by Google last year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Over 750,000 applications for US birth certificate copies exposed online</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An online company that allows users to obtain a copy of their birth and death certificates from U.S. state governments has exposed a massive cache of applications — including their personal information.
More than 752,000 applications for copies of birth certificates were found on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage bucket. (The bucket also had 90,400 death certificate applications, but these could not be accessed or downloaded.)
The bucket wasn’t protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew the easy-to-guess web address access to the data.
Each application process differed by state, but performed the same task: allowing customers to apply to their state’s record-keeping authority — usually a state’s department of health — to obtain a copy of their historical records. The applications we reviewed contained the applicant’s name, date-of-birth, current home address, email address, phone number and historical personal information, including past addresses, names of family members and the reason for the application — such as applying for a passport or researching family history.
The applications dated back to late-2017 and the bucket was updating daily. In one week, the company added about 9,000 applications to the bucket.
U.K.-based penetration testing company Fidus Information Security found the exposed data. TechCrunch verified the data by matching names and addresses against public records.
Fidus and TechCrunch sent several emails prior to publication to warn of the exposed data, but we received only automated emails and no action was taken. We are not naming the company. When reached, Amazon would not intervene but said it would inform the customer.
We also reached out to the local data protection authority to warn of the security lapse, but it did not immediately comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft to finally shut down to-do list app Wunderlist on May 6, 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft has for years promised it would eventually shut down to-do list app Wunderlist, which it acquired in 2015, in favor of its own app, To Do — after it felt the latter was able to offer a competitive experience that included Wunderlist’s best features. Today, Microsoft is finally announcing a shut-down date for Wunderlist of May 6, 2020. After this date, Wunderlist to-dos will no longer sync, but users will still be able to import their content into Microsoft’s own To Do app.
Some Wunderlist users may be disappointed but, to be fair, Microsoft allowed Wunderlist to operate far longer than expected, compared with how most acquisitions of this nature tend to go. And the company prepared Wunderlist users for the app’s inevitable closure as far back as April 2017.
In the meantime, Microsoft has been working to ensure that users’ favorite features — like list groups (folders), steps (subtasks), file attachments, sharing and task assignments — made their way over to Microsoft To Do.
In September, Microsoft unveiled another upgrade for To Do which hinted the Wunderlist shut down could be nearing, with the addition of new backgrounds, smart lists and a personalized daily planner offering smart suggestions of tasks to be accomplished. It also integrated To Do with other Microsoft apps like Outlook, Microsoft Planner, Cortana and Microsoft Launcher on Android.
At the same time, Wunderlist’s creator Christian Reber took to Twitter to express remorse over Wunderlist’s coming closure, and even suggested he would buy the app back if allowed. Reber wasn’t expressing sour grapes, necessarily, but rather a desire to fulfill his original vision for the app, which included building out features like shared folders and cross-team collaboration, for example. (Reber is currently involved with a new content collaboration startup, Pitch, which he co-founded. So returning to Wunderlist never really seemed feasible.)
Microsoft says it decided to now move to close down Wunderlist because it has stopped releasing new features for the app and, as the app ages, it will become more difficult to maintain. In addition, it wants to at last focus its full energies on making its To Do app the best alternative to Wunderlist.
While Wunderlist to-dos will no longer sync after May 6, 2020, the app will be supported until that time. As time goes on, Microsoft will make no guarantees that everything will continue to work properly after the end date.
Microsoft also says that, as of today, it’s no longer accepting new sign-ups for Wunderlist in preparation for the app’s closure.
To make the switch, To Do users can access the iOS, Android, Mac, PC or web app to use the Wunderlist importer. (A link to the importer is in the Settings.) You also can choose to export lists from Wunderlist to To Do from the Wunderlist app, if you prefer.
Once your content is properly imported, users can switch over to To Do, which now features a similar design following the fall update, but introduces new features as well, like the personalized My Day home screen. In addition, Microsoft Outlook emails and Planner tasks can now be sent to To Do. Meanwhile, a Planned Smart List will show everything with a due date, and this can be configured to only show today’s tasks, if you prefer.
“Some of you have been on this journey with us since the very beginning,” said Microsoft, in an announcement. “You, our users, mean everything to us, and we hope that you continue to share our vision and join us on this next step of our journey. You helped us make Wunderlist what it is, and we’d love for you to help us do the same with To Do. Tell us what you love and what you’d like to see added or updated. With our latest additions – printing, smart due dates, and dark mode – you can be sure that we always take your feedback into consideration when building new features,” the company said.
Wunderlist had 26 million installs globally across iOS and Android platforms since January 1, 2014, according to data from Sensor Tower. Downloads since the app was acquired by Microsoft on June 1, 2015 stand at approximately 18.6 million. And in 2019, the app has been installed by 3 million users, down from 4 million during the same period in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Updates to Incognito mode and your Timeline in Maps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">People turn to Google Maps to make their lives easier—whether it's getting tips and recommendations tailored to your daily commute, or knowing when your favorite restaurants, grocery stores and places may be the most crowded so you can avoid a long wait in line. Handy tools like this are improved by Location History–when you turn it on, this optional setting helps make Maps more useful for everyone, as well as personalized to your needs.
Throughout this year, we've focused on making it easier to control, manage and delete your Location History information. Location History is off by default, and you can choose to delete all or part of your history automatically when you turn it on. We introduced auto-delete controls so you can choose to keep only three or 18 months’ worth of data—anything older than that will be automatically deleted. Your Data in Maps lets you quickly access your Location History and other privacy controls with just a few taps. And on Android, Incognito mode on Google Maps stops searches or places you navigate to within Maps from being saved to your Google Account.
Today, we have two updates: Incognito mode is rolling out on Google Maps for iOS today, and bulk delete in Timeline will arrive on Android next month.
Incognito mode
Incognito mode on iOS works the same way it does on Android. While in Incognito mode, the places you search for or navigate to won’t be saved to your Google Account and you won’t see personalized features within Maps, like restaurant recommendations based on dining spots you’ve been to previously. Using Incognito mode on your phone will not update your Location History, so the places you go won’t be saved to your Timeline.
Bulk delete in Timeline 
Your Timeline is a tool that uses your Location History to help you easily remember places and routes you’ve visited–and on Android, share them with friends. With bulk delete, you can quickly find and delete multiple places from your Timeline and Location History all at once. You’ll still have the ability to delete all or part of your Timeline by date range from your Location History settings. 
How Location History improves Google Maps
We’re committed to providing simple, easy-to-use tools to manage your Location History—as well as clearly explaining how it makes products more useful. Scroll through the images below to learn more about Google Maps features made more helpful by Location History.
Stay up to date on your Location History settings
It’s our goal to help you stay informed about your Location History. If you’ve chosen to turn Location History on, you’ll receive periodic email reminders that let you know what data you’re saving, and ways you can manage it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Using the web to help young people find work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Africa has the world’s highest recorded youth unemployment rate. Many young people are unable to access job opportunities due to a lack of financial resources and necessary work experience. Allan van der Muelen, the co-founder of start-up Zlto, is changing this. 
Zlto is a web-based digital rewards platform that incentivizes young people to gain work experience by volunteering in the community. Users build a digital resume by uploading completed work assignments, showing both their impact on the project and the skills they gained while completing the task. For each project they also earn Zlto, a digital currency that can be spent on a range of items, like food, clothing, mobile data and transportation, thanks to collaborations with national retail partners. 
“I work with young people to show them that they do have choices and the Web is giving them access to even more,” he says. In 2018, Zlto won the Google Impact Challenge and more recently started working with Chrome engineers to streamline their web app. 
People access Zlto through devices with limited capabilities and with limited data and connections. So providing them with instant access to the platform is critical to the company’s success. By building on the web, the Zlto team was able to make the app widely accessible. A typical Zlto user accesses their web app three times a day, so it’s critical that their experience is reliable. The Zlto team uses modern web technologies to ensure the app is responsive and reliable, and they use tools including Google’s Lighthouse to monitor the app’s performance and make instant fixes.
Zlto is having a notable impact in the Cape Town Flats, securing permanent work for more than 2,300 young people in the last 12 months; there are 36,000 volunteers working with more than 1.2 million people in the community. The team is now piloting the launch of Zlto in Tanzania as well as the United Kingdom, working with the Newbigin House charity in support of asylum seekers and other individuals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Google Play works</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are more than 2.5 billion active Android devices worldwide—and that number is growing. A major force behind that growth is Google Play, the global online content store that brings incredible apps, games and digital content to Android users everywhere.
Today we are publishing the “How Google Play Works” report, a comprehensive look under the hood at how the Play Store operates, focusing on how we keep users safe and how we support developers and help them build sustainable global businesses. 
At Android Dev Summit 2019, we announced that there were over 116 billion downloads from Google Play in the last 12 months. With such scale comes an enormous responsibility to respect and protect everyone involved—both the people downloading the apps, and the developers creating them.
This is why we continually review our Google Play developer policies, which cover topics ranging from bullying and harassment to malware. It’s why we try to scan all apps being installed with Play Protect, even apps that don’t come from Play. It’s also why we invest heavily in helping to make developers successful in sustainable ways that respect our users and their devices.
Creating a global platform for everyone and providing useful tools for developers has been our goal since we launched the very first Android device. 
As content and devices evolve, so will the Google Play Store, and we look forward to bringing developers and users the very best digital discovery and store experience.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Congrats on completing the marathon. What happens now? 
You might notice a drop in your RPMs and impressions. Don’t panic, it’s ok. You didn’t do anything wrong it’s the January blues. Remember that RPMs and internet traffic drive spikes but can also drive drops. As internet traffic decreases after the holiday, it is common to experience a drop in January. This is your RPMs returning to normal. This represents a new opportunity for you to focus on retaining the audience you gained and experiment with your AdSense account. 
Users are still online in January but their searches are different. This could be the time of a year for a perfect match between their searches and your content. Users have many topics on their radar, such as lifestyle, health and travel.
Check Google Trends to find out what search queries were trending in your audience’s location last January.
January isn’t the right time of the year that matches with your content? Good news, there’s a lot of seasonal holidays to watch out for in the following months. Here’s a list of seasonal peaks in 2020. Let’s find yours.
If you are thinking of starting a new site, make sure to take a look at these AMP-first tips. Creating an AMP-first site gives you a high performance - faster page load time, better user experience on mobile and more overall traffic. Review the WordPress themes that make creating an AMP site easy. Create the site, install theme and install the AMP plugin. 
Learn more about themes.
It’s time to have some fun and try out some changes. Is there a feature you wanted to test before the holiday but didn’t get a chance to implement it? Why not try it now? Visit the Optimization tab in your AdSense account. It provides you with bespoke recommendations that could improve performance, and A/B experiments to help you make more informed decisions for your site. 
Learn more about opportunities and experiments.
Take note of each end of quarter in your region. Why? Advertisers tend to spend more at the end of each quarter when they have budget leftover. Remember, an increase in advertiser spent also means potential increase of RPMs.

The three different tip options give a range of different sizes to sit snug in the ear. They have a good range of sounds and rich bass without being tinny. The case automatically charges the ear buds when they are placed back into the holder. Pairing to a device is quick and easy and there is hardly any distortion away from the device whilst playing. You can also configure each ear bud to connect to a different device. Although the sound will be mono, two people can listen to the device they choose. The ear buds deliver about 5 hours play time -- although I only used them for a couple of hours at a time. The case holds enough charge for them to charge a further six times giving up to 30 hours battery life. They are sweat-proof too if you want to use these for sport.
The Destek wireless ear buds have ear hooks to help secure the ear buds in your ear. The ear buds will give up to 8 hours playing time, but the charging case holds up to seven more charges when the ear buds are replaced into the case giving up to 65 hours playing time. This means that you have several days music before you need to recharge the case and buds.These IPX7 waterproof ear buds can wirelessly charge too, and there are 3 different tips to ensure comfort when listening.
The Poweradd speaker is loud. Its small form factor packs in 36W of sound from its 2 x 13W drivers and 2 x 5W subwoofers.  I like speakers with rich bass and this delivers a good range of sound throughout. It is a compact speaker at only 6.81 inches high and it weighs 2.3 pounds. This is a solid speaker which is IPX7 rated, so if you accidentally drop this in the bath, it will still work – and even continue to play music underwater. Crank this up to the max for a really good sound
These noise cancelling ear buds deliver a great range of sound with no distortion when away from the device. They also have TWS -- True Wireless Stereo -- and pair quickly to your device. There are three ear tips for a secure fit, although I did not find these as comfortable as the Tribit speakers.These ear buds are a bit trebly for me -- and the bass did not come up too high at all making me feel that they were a little tinny on some tracks. However, I am a bass fan and your ears might love the rich sounds these speakers deliver.These IPX7 waterproof ear buds have over six hours playing time from a charging time of under two hours, and usefully, the carrying case can be charged wirelessly. You can charge the ear buds from the case a further four times, giving up to 30 hours total play time.
These ear buds have an unusual fit. Instead of an ear hook, these ear buds have a heel on the bud to keep it secure whilst listening to your sounds. The ear buds will give about three hours of play time and the carry case will charge the buds for another four charges giving up to 12 hours play time. These ear buds are only rated IPX4 -- which means that they are splash-proof and sweat-proof -- but do not get them too close to running water. They are reminiscent of Air Pods -- but at a considerably cheaper price. The shape of the cone focuses the sound into your ear canal so you get a really loud sound when the ear buds are fitted correctly.
The PuroBasic wired headphones limit sound to 85db so that children can not turn the sound up too much and potentially damage their hearing. The headphones are wired so they will fit any device that has a 3.5mm jack.
Useful tech gadgets for every geek.
The best durable tech items that will last and last.
It is difficult for me to choose a favorite from this list of speakers -- but one of these will hit the spot for sure, delivering decent sounds when you are back at college.
Get your groove on whilst you are out and about with these superb rugged Bluetooth waterproof portable speakers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cadillac will help you shop for cars in a live virtual showroom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cadillac is moving some of the car shopping process online... if not necessarily the parts you'd want the most. The automaker has launched a Cadillac Live service that lets you check out car features and ask questions through a live video connection to a showroom with iPhone-toting specialists. Effectively, you can conduct the usual dealership tour without having to travel halfway across town. Representatives can also share options like accessories, colors and wheels through a digital interface -- just in case that Escalade on display isn't baller enough.
Live help doesn't run around the clock, but it's still much better than your usual dealer. You can talk to agents between 9AM and 1AM Eastern from Monday through Thursday, 9AM to 9PM Eastern on Fridays, and 11AM to 7PM Eastern on Saturdays and Sundays. Residents of California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas can also join in a pilot that will connect them to a dealership if they want to go on a test drive or complete a purchase.
Notice what isn't an option, though: you can't actually buy a car through the Live service. Unlike Tesla, Polestar and other relative newcomers that can complete transactions online, you'll still have to visit a dealership and contend with arbitrary markups, hidden costs and pressure from sales reps. Cadillac Live is still a significant improvement to the sales process, and gives the brand an edge over online-focused rivals that don't let you virtually kick the tires before you buy. It's just that the company isn't ready to completely enter the 21st century.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cadillac Live lets you browse the showroom floor without leaving home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cadillac earlier this year launched a live virtual showroom for Canadian customers. One part personal shopper, one part interactive digital showroom, the feature allows potential buyers to conduct a one-way video chat with a product specialist so they can learn more about specific Cadillac vehicles from the comfort of their own home.
Seemingly a success, the service is now migrating south of the border for American shoppers.
Unfortunately, it’s really only for lead generation / to educate shoppers as you’ll still need to visit a local dealership to schedule a test drive and to complete a transaction.
Those interested in a vehicle from the luxury division of General Motors can schedule a chat with a live agent between the hours of 9am through 1am Eastern on Monday through Friday, 9am to 9pm Eastern on Fridays and 11am through 7pm ET on weekends. Again, you’ll still need to reach out to your local dealership to move forward with the buying process but at least you’ll be able to do so without going in blindly.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boeing is promising 3 fixes to the faulty autopilot behind the 737 Max crashes to let pilots stop it forcing the plane into an unstoppable nose-dive, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boeing is promising three fixes for the faulty autopilot system widely attributed as a cause of two deadly crashes by the 737 Max plane, CBS News reported Sunday.
The manufacturer told stakeholders in Seattle last week it will introduce changes to the jets Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), CBS News reported, citing documents from a presentation by the company.
The pilots in both crashes had struggled with MCAS, which was designed to automatically push the plane’s nose down to stabilize the jet.
In the first crash, suffered by Indonesia’s Lion Air, MCAS activated at least 20 times before the crash.
The software had relied on data from one of the plane’s two “angle-of-attack” (AOA) sensors, which monitored the plane’s position in the sky.
Both pilots tried to push back against the system by angling the plane back up dozens of times, but MCAS kept reactivating – which ultimately led to the two planes crashing and killing 346 people.
Boeing said it has addressed these problems with updated software, CBS News reported. Here are the changes they plan to make, according to the news network:
Boeing also told attendees that it had flown 1,850 flight hours with the software updates, and spent more than 100,000 employee hours in engineering and test-developing the new issues, CBS News reported.
Multiple Boeing employees have spoken of the company’s internal pressures to develop planes quickly and to keep manufacturing costs down.
Boeing has not yet responded to Business Insider’s request for comment on the reported changes.
The company’s presentation last week was meant to reassure airplane analysts, airlines, pilots, and flight attendants, CBS News reported. Regulators around the world have grounded their 737 Max jets, and pilots and flight staff have publicly expressed fears of flying them again.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had also come under pressure for vouching for the 737 Max’s safety before the two crashes. The agency now wants to dramatically change its certification process.
Internal messages exchanged by Boeing employees in 2016, which were released in October, also suggested that they had known about the MCAS’ problems but misled the FAA about its dangers.
The 737 Max is expected to return to service in March 2020, though Boeing is trying to get it back in the air sooner.

The manufacturer told stakeholders in Seattle last week that it would introduce changes to the jets' Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, CBS News reported, citing documents from a presentation by the company.
Investigators found that the pilots in both crashes struggled with MCAS, which was designed to automatically push the plane's nose down to stabilize it if it detects a stall.
Before a jet from Indonesia's Lion Air crashed last year, MCAS had activated at least 20 times, investigators said.
The software had relied on data from one of the plane's two "angle-of-attack" sensors, which monitored the plane's position in the sky. Both pilots tried to push back against the system by angling the plane back up dozens of times, but MCAS kept reactivating.

Boeing did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the reported changes.
The company's presentation last week was meant to reassure analysts, airlines, pilots, and flight attendants about the 737 Max, CBS News reported. Regulators around the world have grounded those jets, and pilots and flight staff members have publicly expressed fears about flying them again.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has also come under pressure for vouching for the 737 Max's safety before the two crashes. The agency now wants to dramatically change its certification process.
Internal messages exchanged by Boeing employees in 2016 and released in October also suggested they had known about the MCAS's problems but misled the FAA about its dangers.
The 737 Max is expected to return to service in March, though Boeing is trying to get it back in the air sooner.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk spotted hitting the town -- and a sign -- in the Tesla Cybertruck</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla'sCybertruck is still making a smash.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk was spotted chauffeuring a few friends to dinner at Nobu in Malibu, Calif., on Saturday night in a prototype of his company's upcoming electric pickup.
The Cybertruck suffered an embarrassing debut in November when its "armor" windows were smashed by a small metal ball tossed at them.
According to TMZ, the Cybertruck was left parked out front with security and attracting much attention while the party was dining. At one point, Musk came out with actor Ed Norton to give him a look.
As it left the restaurant, Musk's friend, musician Grimes, was photographed sitting next to him on the stainless steel vehicle's central front jump seat, which allows the cabin to fit six passengers, as in many conventional pickups.
The night didn't go perfectly, however. Musk was videotaped running over a sign with the full-size truck as he pulled out of the parking lot onto the Pacific Coast Highway.
Musk tweeted earlier in the evening that the production version of the Cybertruck could be slightly smaller to make it easier to fit in a garage.
Regardless, there's still plenty of work left to do as the truck Musk was driving wasn't equipped with side-view mirrors or a visible windshield wiper.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Companies can track your phone — unless you change these security settings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For big tech companies, data is money. Their goal is to collect as much info about you as they can, and try as we might, there’s no surefire way to shut them out entirely.
There are steps you can take to limit what advertisers know about you, though. It all starts with your Facebook settings. Tap or click here for 7 ways to delete yourself from the internet.
As consumers demand more privacy, tech companies — including smartphone manufacturers — are slowly responding. Apple’s latest iPhone operating system, iOS 13, has several new privacy settings you need to start using if you aren’t already.
The OS brings hundreds of other changes too, like improved camera settings and a quicker way to type messages. Tap or click for 9 iPhone features you’ll use time and time again.
Once your phone is up to date, it’s time to control how often companies track you and get data from your Apple devices. Keep tech companies and hackers at bay with these new privacy features.
Only you need to know where you are
Many apps ask for permission to know your location. In apps like Google Maps, that makes sense, but social media apps and games want to know your location too. Those have less justification. Tap or click here to see which apps are known for stealing sensitive data.
Sure, you might want to share your location on social media if you’re at a cool new place, and geotags on Snapchat are fun to use too. But it can be genuinely dangerous to post your location publicly — anyone could find you. Savvy hackers use location information to deduce details like your address, where you work and even to determine when you’ll be home.
Thankfully, Apple understands how easily criminals can glean information, so in iOS 13 you now have some serious control over what location data you share with different apps.
RELATED: Another new feature in iOS 13? Apple’s new robocall-blocking solution. I hate robocalls, too, but this doesn’t cut it for me. Tap or click to find out why I think it’s a flop.
Apple has always made it possible to disable location services for certain apps, but the controls are now more specific and customizable.
Once you download iOS 13, control your app location permissions by going to Settings > Privacy > Location Services. You’ll see a list of your apps there, and you can decide how often they get to use the location services. This level of control will help keep your data safe, so make sure you use this feature ASAP.
Know when apps are accessing your data
Even if you control when and where your location services are accessed, some apps can be sneaky.
They’ll access your location in the background every so often to glean just a little bit of data. The amount of information they learn adds up over time, but with iOS 13 you can know when apps are trying to sneak around.
With iOS 13, your iPhone will send you notifications when background apps access your location info.
This notification can help you track down the less scrupulous apps, which tend to be big battery drainers and privacy violators.
From there, you can decide whether to change their location permissions via Settings, or decide if you’d rather remove them altogether. You don’t need apps that access your data without permission — not if you want to be safe.
Block back doors for data gathering
Apps can get your location information from your iPhone’s location services, but it’s not the only way.
Some apps can learn location information from your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, just by seeing where your IP address is located or what devices (which can also report locations) your Bluetooth connects to.
This means your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth permissions also impact how much data companies and apps can gather about you — maybe even more so than location services, since many apps don’t bother to ask for your location at all. They just piece it together themselves. So what can iOS 13 help you do about this?
First, iOS 13 lets you decide Bluetooth permissions on every app you use. As with location services, you access this by going to Settings > Privacy > Bluetooth. Once again, you’ll be presented with a list of your apps, and you can decide if they can access your Bluetooth.
There aren’t customizable options for allowing Bluetooth, but because Bluetooth isn’t always secure, it gives you some control over what data which apps can gather. Tap or click here to learn about a major Bluetooth flaw that exposed millions of devices to attacks.
Next, iOS 13 lets you control some aspects of how your iPhone works on Wi-Fi. You can disable tracking in Safari, so data gathered about you on one site can’t carry over onto another. This makes it hard for companies to send you the same ads over and over, because they have less data to work with.
Just go to Settings > Safari > and toggle off Prevent Cross-Site Tracking.
Another feature of iOS 13 includes a secure password autofill. These are passwords stored in the iCloud Keychain that requires your Touch ID or Face ID to confirm your identity before it auto-fills your passwords onto sites and apps. This feature also allows you to connect to a few third-party password apps like 1Password, Dashlane and LastPass.
Note: You can only use this feature, called Apple sign in, if you have two-factor authentication turned on and you need to be signed in to your Apple ID on your Apple device.
Two-factor authentication is one of the most powerful ways to protect your accounts. Tap or click here to learn how 2FA works.
Keeping your information private on your iPhone is easier than ever with iOS 13’s new features. Make sure you upgrade and use them as soon as you can to keep data gathering down and security up. Your iPhone shouldn’t give out all your information, so iOS 13 helps you share only when necessary. Get it today!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies plans to equip more of its products with its Harmony operating system (OS) next year, and will promote them at home and abroad, a Huawei spokesman said on Monday.
But there are no plans currently to roll out the OS to its phones, tablets and computers, among Huawei’s most popular products, the spokesman added.
The plans were first reported in the government-backed Shenzhen Special Zone Daily newspaper, which cited comments made by Wang Chenglu, president of the Huawei consumer business group’s software division, at a store event held in the city of Shenzhen, where the firm has its headquarters.
Huawei unveiled its proprietary OS in August as a possible alternative to Google’s Android, as it copes with trade restrictions by the United States that threatens to cut its access to technology made by U.S. firms.
A “smart screen”, or connected television product, was its first product to use Harmony, called Hongmeng in Chinese, but it said at the time that it would stick to Android for smartphones and gradually roll out Harmony to other devices such as smartwatches, speakers and virtual reality gadgets.
Wang reiterated that stance at the store event and noted the company would still prefer to use Android on its phones, according to Shenzhen Special Zone Daily.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WireGuard VPN is a step closer to mainstream adoption</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As of this morning, Linux network stack maintainer David Miller has committed the WireGuard VPN project into the Linux "net-next" source tree. Miller maintains both net and net-next—the source trees governing the current implementation of the Linux kernel networking stack and the implementation of the next Linux kernel's networking stack, respectively.
This is a major step forward for the WireGuard VPN project. Net-next gets pulled into the new Linux kernel during its two-week merge window, where it becomes net. With WireGuard already a part of net-next, this means that—barring unexpected issues—there should be a Linux kernel 5.6 release candidate with built-in WireGuard in early 2020. Mainline kernel inclusion of WireGuard should lead to significantly higher uptake in projects and organizations requiring virtual private network capability.
Normal, day-to-day Linux users probably won't see in-kernel WireGuard until late 2020. Ubuntu is one of the faster-moving mainstream distributions, and its next Long Term Support (LTS) release is in April 2020. But the Linux 5.6 kernel and Ubuntu 20.04 will likely be in release candidate status at the same time, so its inclusion in 20.04 seems unlikely. The interim 20.10 Ubuntu release seems like a much safer bet for Canonical's first use of a 5.6 or later kernel. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) inclusion will likely be a year or more beyond that; the current RHEL 8.1 shipped in May 2019 with the 4.18 kernel, which was already 9 months old.
Although highly speculative, it's also possible that WireGuard could land in-kernel on Ubuntu 20.04 even without the 5.6 kernel—WireGuard founder Jason Donenfeld offered to do the work backporting WireGuard into earlier Ubuntu kernels directly. Donenfeld also stated today that a 1.0 WireGuard release is "on the horizon."
While WireGuard is most frequently seen in a Linux context right now, it's available and very capable on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and BSD. Although the highest possible performance comes from running in-kernel, the userland implementation typically still handily outperforms traditional VPNs such as IPSEC and OpenVPN, with faster connection times, lower latency, and significantly decreased battery usage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Render shows OnePlus tackling the midrange market with OnePlus 8 Lite</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">2020 will bring all the usual yearly updates from all the usual phone vendors, but one interesting new addition is a cheaper smartphone from OnePlus. The king of value flagship smartphones is making what looks like a midrange device.
The news comes to us from OnLeaks and 91Mobiles, which have whipped up CAD-based renders of the device. OnLeaks says there's no name for the device yet, but for now, the report is going with "OnePlus 8 Lite." The render shows a device with a flat display measuring somewhere around 6.4-inches and a front camera that lives in a hole punch in the middle of the display, just like a Samsung device. The hole-punch camera is apparently the design OnePlus will go with across its lineup—OnLeaks has released "OnePlus 8 Pro" renders earlier, featuring this same Samsung-y front camera design.
Other features on the render include two cameras and a lot of sensors on the back, a USB-C port and speaker on the bottom, and a physical mute switch on the side. It's hard to imagine an Android phone shipping without a fingerprint reader (unless you're Google, I guess), so an in-screen fingerprint reader is probably included. There's no headphone jack, which is a shame for a mid-range device.
The design doesn't really matter, though. What we're mainly interested in are the specs and price, which are mysteries for now. OnePlus regularly delivers the best bang-for-your-buck in the industry, and having the company build something cheaper than a flagship smartphone has the potential for greatness. For now, we'll have to be on the lookout for more info before the launch sometime next year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new on-demand streaming service for movies and TV shows has launched in the UK and unlike rivals such as Netflix or Amazon Prime - the platform is free.
Plex is offering thousands of films, TV shows and web series to stream without charge - including titles such as Zulu, Rain Man, Raging Bull, Lord of War, The Terminator, Apocalypse Now and Thelma and Louise.
Plex says it will continue to add new content on top of its current library of thousands of Hollywood blockbusters, TV shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals and more, reports The Express .
Plex has teamed up with Warner Bros to offer the service - which includes adverts - and has just launched.
All you need to view any of the content is a Plex account, which is free to set-up.
Plex’s library includes content from the major Hollywood studios, including MGM, Lionsgate, Legendary and Warner Bros.
Until now, Plex had been a media library service designed to help you keep your own video content organised and available to stream on any of your devices.
Plex CEO Keith Valory, said: "Plex was born out of a passion for media and entertainment, and offering free ad-supported premium movies and TV shows is just the latest step in our mission to bring all your favorite content together in one place.
"What started more than a decade ago as a passion project to make accessing media on connected devices easier has evolved into the most comprehensive streaming platform in the industry, used by millions of people around the world."
Plex is available to download for free on iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Android TV, Fire TV, macOS, Windows and other platforms

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:36:38 pm
The YZF-R15 Version 3.0 in BS VI follows the introduction of Yamaha BS VI vehicles – FZ FI (149 cc) and FZS FI (149 cc).
India Yamaha Motor (IYM) on Monday launched BS-VI compliant YZF-R15 Version 3.0 motorcycle model with price starting at Rs 1.45 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
The 155cc will be available across all company dealerships in India from the third week of December 2019, IYM said in a statement.
The YZF-R15 Version 3.0 in BS VI follows the introduction of Yamaha BS VI vehicles – FZ FI (149 cc) and FZS FI (149 cc) – in November this year, it added.
The new motorcycle has features such as side stand engine cut-off switch, dual horn and radial tubeless tyre at the rear wheel.
The bike to be available in three colour options are priced between Rs 1.45 lakh and Rs 1.47 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
Commenting on the launch, Yamaha Motor India group of companies Chairman Motofumi Shitara said, “With Yamaha continuing to perk up track performances with the R series, the new YZF-R15 Version 3.0 with BS VI compliant engine and new features will be able to create optimum excitement in India in its respective category”.
Yamaha strived for optimum cost control for the new BS-VI compliant YZF-R15 version 3.0 and achieved to peg it around 3 per cent higher along with new standard features, he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yamaha's BS6-compliant R15 V3.0 sees a Rs 4,400 increase in price compared to the BS4 model.
Exactly a month after Yamaha launched its first BS6-compliant two-wheelers – the FZ and FZ-S – the manufacturer has launched the BS6-compliant iteration of the popular R15 V3.0. Prices for the updated bikes start at Rs 1.45 lakh, which is a hike of just Rs 4,400 over the BS4 model.
The switch to BS6, however, has brought with it a slight drop in power. While the 155cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine on the BS4 version produced 19.3hp at 10,000 rpm and 14.7Nm at 8,500 rpm, this new model produces 18.6hp and 14.1Nm at similar points in the rev range.
The new YZF-R15 V3.0 will be available in three colours – Racing Blue (Rs 1.46 lakh), Thunder Grey (Rs 1.45 lakh) and Darknight (Rs 1.47 lakh). Interestingly, the Racing Blue variant will get blue-coloured wheels, as seen on the bike sold in Indonesia and other Asian markets. This also means we could see the BS6 iteration of the MT-15 receive its quirky wheel colours.
Commenting on the launch, Motofumi Shitara, Chairman, Yamaha Motor India said, “With Yamaha continuing to perk up track performances with the R series, the new YZF-R15 Version 3.0 with BS6-compliant engine and new features will be able to create optimum excitement in India in its respective category.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BioShock is an incredible first-person shooter franchise that deals with the collapse of various isolated communities. Many years ago, the previous developer was shut down by parent company 2K Games, but now, another team has emerged to take its place. Today, we received a press release that recognized the establishment of Cloud Chamber.
According to 2K, Cloud Chamber is "a collective of storytellers eager to push the frontlines of interactive entertainment by making unique, entertaining, and thoughtful experiences." Cloud Chamber will build its team in San Francisco and Montréal. The bigger news is that Cloud Chamber is working on the next iteration of the BioShock franchise. Unfortunately, it's going to be in development for several years because the team wants to get it right. It's unclear where the story will unfold this time around.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Oculus Quest is a standalone virtual reality (VR) headset that has become quite popular in recent months. It allows you to experience the wonders of VR without attaching long cables connecting it to your computer.
The Quest relies on two controllers for inputs, but that's about to change very soon. Today, Oculus announced that hand tracking was coming to the headset this week. The press release Android Central received said that the team wanted to "share that we'll be rolling out an initial version of hand tracking as an early feature for consumers on Oculus Quest this week."
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
The initial release date was pegged in early 2020, but it's coming out sooner than expected. That's great news in my book because I've been wanting to try it out for a while now. Quest users will have to turn on this feature in the Experimental Features menu, then use their hands to navigate and interact within Quest's Home interfaces like Library and Store, plus in select first-party apps like the Oculus Browser and Oculus TV.
Luckily, if you don't like it, you can even switch between your hands and controllers with a new toggle within the Quest Home menu, as well as set the floor height for a stationary Guardian using only your hands. Keep in mind that developers will have to update their games to support hand tracking. It seems like this probably won't happen until 2020. Which games do you want to play with just your hands? Do you think it'll work well? Let us know.
Options to enjoy VR
The Oculus Quest is known for its untethered nature, but now it also has the ability to play PCVR games with Oculus Link. The feature is in beta but allows you to play powerful VR games on a headset that you can then detach from your PC and use on the go.
Oculus recommends this cable for trying out Oculus Link until the official Oculus Link Cable becomes available.
This USB-C to USB-C cable supports 20 Gbps transfer speeds, 5A/20V power, USB 3.1, and USB 3.2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snapchat working on 'deepfake' feature which is not as sinister as it sounds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat is working on a ‘deepfake’ feature which will let users add their face to videos.
The new tool is called Cameo and will allow people to replace faces in clips with their own beautiful visage.
A deepfake video uses artificial intelligence to map the likeness of one person onto another.
It’s feared that the technology will be used to destabilise society because it allows the creation of highly convincing fake news.
But there are good reasons not to fear the arrival of Cameo.
It’s being tested in France right now and is likely to be rolled out across the world in the coming weeks or months.
In a statement, Snapchat said: ‘Cameos aren’t ready to take the stage yet, but stay tuned for their global debut soon.’
Deepfake is a portmanteau combining the words ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’, referring to simulated videos of human beings.
Its power has been vividly showcased in footage which shows the
The tech uses machine learning or artificial intelligence to combine digital images with audio files to make convincing-looking fake footage of people uttering words they’ve actually said.
We’ve already it used to bring the Mona Lisa spring to life, whilst pornographers are already creating deepfake sex videos which make it look like mainstream stars are getting involved in the action.
Politics is likely to be profoundly affected by the technology, which was demonstrated recently in a video which appeared to show Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other. 
It’s easy to see how it could be used to make effective propaganda or sew distrust among citizens, who may become unable to work out if a video is fake or genuine.
Snapchat’s own deepfake offering is not as sinister at it sounds for one simple reason: it’s not all that convincing yet.
It will superimpose your face onto a video, sure, but the resulting creation is not particularly realistic.
This means the feature is more suitable for comedy or the creation of bespoke reaction gifs than, you know, subverting democracy.
Snapchat has created 150 looping video gifs for Cameo. You’ll be able to cut out an image of a face and then add it to an actor’s own features in one of these clips.
You’ll also be able to easily send Cameos in chats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Minecraft Bedrock Edition out this week with PS4 crossplay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like Sony has finally given in when it comes to crossplay on Minecraft, with a new Bedrock Edition coming to PS4 this week.
Sony has never been keen on cross-play – the ability to play the same game with other people even if they’re using different consoles. As far as they’re concerned everyone should be playing on the PlayStation 4 and they don’t want to even acknowledge the existence of rivals.
But their position has slowly mellowed over time, with games such as Fortnite and Rocket League allowing for crossplay and now, apparently, Minecraft as well.
Of course, the problem with Minecraft is that it’s owned by Microsoft, but leaked images of a new retail edition called Minecraft Bedrock Edition suggest Sony has finally relented.
Sony hasn’t announced anything yet, so this could be the world’s most elaborate and pointless hoax (and god knows we’ve had a few of those), but with a new State of Play livestream due tomorrow it seems very likely it’ll be announced then.
Multiple fans online have posted pictures of the box, which is supposedly in stores now, ready to be put up on shelves, and it clearly describes what’s needed for crossplay to work (basically a Microsoft account).
There was also a listing on Best Buy for a short time, before it was taken down, in what has been an all-round terrible attempt to keep the secret.
But assuming all this is true then from this week you’ll be able to play Minecraft together with friends no matter whether they’re playing on an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or Android device.
State of Play is Sony’s equivalent to a Nintendo Direct and has frequently been used to announce new games and services.
The next one is due to take place on Tuesday, 10 December and it’s now widely expected to feature the first public unveiling of the Resident Evil 3 remake, since it’s been confirmed it won’t be at The Game Awards on Friday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp ending support for millions of phones later this month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WhatsApp has announced it will soon stop working on millions of phones around the world as they reach the end of their supported lifespan.
That means users on a variety of older handsets could end up losing access to the messaging app.
Facebook-owned WhatsApp has confirmed via its support page that it will stop supporting these devices on December 31, 2019.
The company says that any phone running the Windows Mobile operating system will not be supported after this date. However, that’s not all.
Any iPhone running software older than iOS 7 will no longer be supported and neither will any Android device with version 2.3.7 installed. The iOS and Android blocks won’t happen this month but will take place on February 1, 2020.
The last iPhones released running iOS 7 were the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C back in 2013. It was superseded by iOS 8 in 2014 so if you bought an iPhone (or iPad) after that date you’re going to be fine.
Similarly, Android 2.3.7 was known as ‘Gingerbread’ and was launched way back in 2010. By the February of 2011 it had been supplanted by Android 3.0, also known as Honeycomb. Chances are, unless you’re still rocking a Google Nexus S or a Samsung Galaxy S, you’ll probably be fine.
Windows Mobile is even older – it was originally rolled out in 2003 and ran until 2010 on devices like the Motorola MPx200. When it became clear that iOS and Android were more superior, Microsoft re-engineered its mobile operating system into the tile-based Windows Phone OS – which didn’t fare much better.
WhatsApp says that anyone using these older phones can no longer create new accounts or reverify existing accounts.
‘Because we no longer actively develop for these operating systems, some features might stop functioning at any time,’ the company said in a blog post announcing the cut-off dates.
WhatsApp regularly stops support for older devices, forcing users to keep up to date if they want to continue using the app.
Here are all the dates that WhatsApp stopped working on older phone systems.
‘As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use,’ WhatsApp said to justify why it routinely strips support for older operating systems.
‘While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don’t offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app’s features in the future. This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.
‘If you use one of these affected mobile devices, we recommend upgrading to a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone to continue using WhatsApp.’
As well as ditching older systems, WhatsApp is focused on adding new features for current systems. It is currently working on a dark mode which should help reduce its battery usage a bit, but it’s not available for general release.
Now the app detectives at WABetaInfo have found a clever new feature which should allow dark mode to bring even more light to your life.
It is rooted through beta mode to find a new option buried in the settings. This will let you choose between the light and dark side of WhatsApp, but also tick a box marked ‘battery saver’. This automatically switches on dark mode when your juice is running low.
‘WhatsApp doesn’t stop amazing us, continuing to improve with new features like the Battery Saver option’ the blog wrote.
The feature was found in a beta version of the software for Android. It will eventually be released to the public and run on every device, but it’s not clear when this will take place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PS6 due in 2026 says Sony, PS5 Pro in three to four years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Get your pre-orders ready because the PS6 could be out as early as 2026, with a PS5 Pro model perhaps as early as 2023.
By this time next year the PlayStation 5 should be out, but despite some rumours to the contrary there’ll only be one model, with Sony saying it has no plans for a PS5 Pro until a few years later.
That is how things worked this generation, although since the Pro version (and the Xbox One X) were a new idea at that point there was some speculation that maybe they’d be available from the start.
Masayasu Ito, Sony’s Executive VP of Hardware Engineering, has implied that won’t happened but has said that the PlayStation 5 will have an effective lifespan of six to seven years, with a Pro version coming out somewhere in the middle.
‘In the past, the cycle for a new platform was 7 to 10 years, but in view of the very rapid development and evolution of technology, it’s really a six to seven year platform cycle’, he told Game Informer.
‘Then we cannot fully catch up with the rapid development of the technology, therefore our thinking is that as far as a platform is concerned for the PS5, it’s a cycle of maybe six to seven years. But doing that, a platform lifecycle, we should be able to change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancements in technology. That was the thinking behind it, and the test case of that thinking was the PS4 Pro that launched in the midway of the PS4 launch cycle.’
As you can see he only implies the existence of the PS5 Pro but by his own logic one would be necessary in order to keep the PlayStation 5 up-to-date with new technology.
That immediately led LetsGoDigital to create a 3D mock-up, as they do for all new Sony patents and rumours, although at this point there’s no indication of what it could possibly look like (although we’re going to take a mad guess and say it’ll be a big black box).
Perhaps the most interesting comment is simply that Ito is talking about PlayStation 6 at all, even if it’s very vaguely.
With the rise of streaming there has to be a serious question as to whether the next generation of consoles will be the last one, but from what he’s saying that’s not how Sony are thinking about things at all. At least not for now anyway.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Minecraft on PS4 is finally getting cross-platform play</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Beginning on Dec. 10, the PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft will allow for cross-platform play. That means players across every major gaming platform — Nintendo Switch, Windows, Xbox One, iOS and Android, as well as Gear VR devices — will now be able to play together in the same online world.
After generations of exclusivity, default cross-platform play in modern video games is a relatively new concept. It began in earnest in late 2018 when Epic Games’ Fortnitehelped convince the major console manufacturers to play nice. Throughout 2019, more and more titles have piled on, including Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Now Minecraft joins the fray, but there’s a twist.
“PS4 players will now have their purchases and progress carry across platforms,” wrote Mojang’s Kelsey Howard in today’s press release. That means worlds, skins, min-games, and mas up packs available on the Minecraft Marketplace will all be accessible across every platform.
Minecraftis the single best-selling game of all time, beating out Tetris with a reported 176 million units sold. That’s in part why Polygon named it one of the most important games of the last decade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A bug may have revealed Modern Warfare’s battle royale mode</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare may be getting a battle royale mode, which is obviously not a first. The first inklings of the mode leaked through data miners last month, but now a strange new glitch (in a game that has a few of them) appears to confirm everything those leaks suggested.
In November, data miners posted information about a series of files that they found in the PC version of Modern Warfare that referenced something called “BR.” The files contained a description for a mode called “Battle Royale,” a player count of up to 200, and even a top down view of the map the mode supposedly takes place on.
While there was no evidence for the mode outside of the files at the time of the leaks, a new bug seems to confirm suspicions. Late Sunday night, Reddit user Nateberg3 posted a video of themselves being transported high above a strange new map after attempting to load into a Spec Ops match. From their vantage point, they’re able to look around at the entire map and see many of the same places that popped up in the leaked map from the battle royale mode.
According to the earlier leak, this battle royale mode is being developed by Raven Software and will be released in early 2020 as a free to play, standalone mode. So far, there has been no official word from Activision on whether or not Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is actually getting a battle royale mode or not.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon is one-upping its own Black Friday deal, throwing in a $30 Amazon credit with the purchase of a Nintendo Switch console. The retailer ran a similar offer on Black Friday, throwing in a $25 credit with the Nintendo Switch Lite. Turns out good things do come to those who wait; In this case, the good thing is some extra money to spend at Amazon.
Nintendo is notoriously stingy when it comes to deals, which is why many retailers offer their own bundles or, in this case, store credit in lieu of official discounts. While Nintendo’s official Black Friday deal for 2019 was an outdated Mario Kart 8 bundle, both Amazon and GameStop offered a $25 gift card with the Nintendo Switch Lite. And for Cyber Monday, Nintendo threw in a 128 GB microSD card with the updated Nintendo Switch model. So, given that microSD cards of that size are currently going for around $20, this deal is better by about $10.
In order to redeem Amazon’s offer, make sure you’re adding the HAC-001(-01) model, detailed here, to your cart (with either Red/Blue or Gray Joy-Cons.) Then enter the code D3E2CDJ6GB6S at checkout. (That code is listed on the Amazon page as well.) You’ll get an email from Amazon within 35 days with confirmation that the $30 credit has been added to your account.

We have been listening to your feedback and are excited to share the improvements we’ve made.
We designed Collections based on what you do on the web. If you’re a shopper, it will help you collect and compare items. If you’re an event or trip organizer, Collections will help pull together all your trip or event information as well as ideas to make your event or trip a success. If you’re a teacher or student, it will help you organize your web research and create your lesson plans or reports. Whatever you are doing on the web, Collections can help.
We’ve been working hard to add more functionality and refine the feature over the last couple months – some of which were directly informed by your feedback.
Here are some of the improvements we made, based on your input:
Access your collections across your devices: We’ve added sync to Collections. We know some of you have seen issues around sync, your feedback has been helping us improve. We know this is an important scenario and are ready for you to try it. When you are signed into Microsoft Edge preview builds with the same profile on different computers, Collections will sync between them.
Open all links in a collection into a new window: We’ve heard you’d like an easy way to open all sites saved in a collection. Try out “Open all” from the “Sharing and more” menu to open tabs in a new window, or from the context menu on a collection to open them as tabs in the current window so you can easily pick up where you left off. We’ve also heard that you want an easy way to save a group of tabs to a collection. This is something that we are actively working on and are excited to share when it is ready.
Edit card titles: You’ve been asking for the ability to rename the titles of items in collections, so they are easier for you to understand. Now you can. To edit a title, right click and choose “Edit” from the context menu. A dialog will appear giving you the ability to rename the title.
Dark theme in Collections: We know you love dark theme, and we want to make sure we provide a great experience in Collections. We’ve heard some feedback on notes which we’ve addressed. Try it out and let us know what you think.
 “Try Collections” flyout: We understand that if you’re an active user of Collections that we were showing you the “Try Collections” flyout even though you previously used the feature. We’ve now tuned the flyout to be quieter.
Sharing a collection: You’ve told us that once you’ve collected content you want to share it with others. We have lots of work planned to better support sharing scenarios. One way you can share today is through the “Copy all” option added to the “Sharing and more” menu, or by selecting individual items and copying them via the “Copy” button in the toolbar.
Once you’ve copied items from your Collection, you can then paste them into your favorite apps, like OneNote or Email. If you are pasting into an app that supports HTML you will get a rich copy of the content.
You can get started by opening the Collections pane from the button next to the address bar.
When you open the Collections pane, select Start new collection and give it a name. As you browse, you can start to add content related to your collection.
Now that we’re on by default, we hope that more of you will give us a try. Thank you again to all of you that have been using the feature and sending us feedback. If you think something’s not working right, or if there’s some capability you’d like to see added, please send us feedback using the smiley face icon in the top right corner of the browser.
Thanks for continuing to be a part of this preview!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Store empowers students with free Computer Science Education Week workshops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One hundred and thirteen years ago in New York, a girl was born into a generation where the average woman was more likely to perfect a signature pie recipe than solve a pi-based equation. Pushing against expectations, this girl became one of the pre-eminent technologists of our times and made it possible to convert human language into machine code understood by computers. On Dec. 9, the anniversary of Admiral Grace Hopper’s birthday kicks off Computer Science Education Week, an annual program dedicated to inspiring K-12 students to take interest in computer science.
As technology such as AI and cloud computing rapidly transforms the future of work, it’s more important than ever for students and educators to develop STEM—science, technology, engineering and math—skills. It’s estimated that over 85 million jobs worldwide will go unfilled by 2030 if we don’t bridge the STEM skills gap—but schools often struggle to implement quality STEM curriculum and prepare students for career paths that are just starting to come into focus.
Inspire students to ignite a passion for Computer Science
Microsoft Stores are committed to empowering students and educators with computer science resources and will host over 400 events in partnership with STEM influencers throughout Computer Science Education Week across locations. Ensuring no one is left behind when it comes to developing increasingly crucial computer science skills, programming this year has an increased focus on inclusion for traditionally underrepresented students.
Microsoft Store workshops will offer hands-on learning centered around coding, game design, app development and more using technologies from Windows, Surface, Office 365, Minecraft and more. Participants will hear from a diverse group of mentors and organizations from across the STEM field, including Lynell Caldwell, NASA, Brandon Copeland, Black Girls Code, Al Smith, Curtis Baham, Lee Woodall, Dennis Brown and Titus O’Neil.
Check your local Microsoft Store to register for exciting workshops geared toward empowering every learner, including workshops like;
In addition to these workshops, Microsoft Stores will also host Minecraft Hour of Code workshops, teaching students of all ages to code with Minecraft. The new Minecraft Hour of Code lesson aligns with this year’s theme, Computer Science for Good. Students will explore coding and artificial intelligence as they protect a village from forest fires in an immersive Minecraft world. Anyone can learn how coding can help build a better world—in just one hour!
Check availability of workshops and RSVP at your local Microsoft Store. Programming will vary by location. And, do you know students always get 10% off at Microsoft Store?* Make sure to take advantage of your discount when you shop at Microsoft Store.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google's AMP for Email lets email recipients browse and interact with content without having to click a link and redirect to another webpage outside of the email.
Adobe announced on Monday that customers using its Campaign email marketing platform can now include dynamic email components via Google's AMP for Email. Adobe said adding Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) support to Campaign will help make email campaigns more interactive and engaging.
Despite its shortcomings as a business and productivity tool, email is still the preferred point of contact between consumers and brands. According to Adobe's annual Consumer Email Survey, 60% of consumers prefer to receive brand offers via email, but only a quarter of the emails they receive are deemed interesting enough to open."Americans spend more than five hours a day checking their emails," Adobe wrote in a blog post. "With consumers spending so much time in their inbox, email has become an essential channel for brands to engage with their customers."AMP for Email is meant to reshape email functionality and help brands better engage with their audiences. With AMP, recipients can respond to an email interactively without having to click a link and redirect to another webpage outside of the email.Further, AMP lets marketers embed real-time info such flight status, events, news, and purchases inside emails, while allowing recipients to do things like confirm their attendance at an event and fill out questionnaires. 
Google launched its open-source framework AMP in February 2016 to enable developers build a faster mobile browsing experience for customers. Based on a diverse architecture using Javascript, HTML and open source technologies, AMP is designed to serve up mobile-optimized content (and ads) with minimal data requirements on mobile networks.For marketers, the AMP for Email effort could create more interesting pitches and outreach programs with customers, better service, and collaboration use cases. Some of these email experiences include RSVPs, questionnaires, catalogs, and hooks into Google Docs. On the customer service front, AMP for Email lets email recipients respond to comments and community boards directly. 
AMP support is available to Adobe Campaign customers now.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft rolls out Campaign Views in public preview for Office 365 ATP customers.
Microsoft is launching today a new security feature in public preview.Named "Campaign Views," this is a new feature that will be available for Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) -- which is the company's paid email filtering service, available as an add-on for Office 365, its multi-functional cloud-based office suite.Campaign Views will be a new section in the Office 365 ATP Threat Explorer dashboard where customers can get a full view of an entire malicious email phishing campaign that's hitting a company's email inboxes.Until today, Office 365 ATP users could only see details about each of the individual malicious emails that reached users. Campaign Views will show details about the entire phishing campaign and all the tricks and infrastructure it uses.The goal is to give security teams an idea of what other tricks the same attacker might be using, so they can put filters and security protections in place.
Microsoft says security teams will be able to view:
To power this new feature, Microsoft will be using its global view over the entire Office 365 infrastructure, but also "machine learning, advanced heuristics, rich detonation capabilities, targeted capabilities to spot business email compromise, and massive security intelligence sources that come together during mail-flow as well as after email delivery."
Per Microsoft, during its public preview stage, Campaign Views will be available for customers with any of the following plans:➢ Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2➢ Office 365 E5➢ Microsoft 365 E5 Security➢ Microsoft 365 E5"The Campaign Views have started rolling out into public preview, so you'll see it in your tenant over the next few days and weeks," Microsoft said.Microsoft said feedback from customers who helped test the feature has been "extremely positive."An official documentation page for the new Campaign Views feature will also go live later today on this Microsoft Docs page.Campaign Views will be added to an already impressive list of Office 365 ATP protections.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The rumored new iPhone SE 2 is rumored to enjoy the name iPhone 9. What could be more perfect?
×
There's been a large hole in my life for the last couple of years.No, it's not the lack of a MacBook keyboard that works. That hole's existed for just over a year. This particularly large, two-year hole has been getting bigger every day as it gnaws at my jaws. It began when Apple launched iPhone X. At the time, data scientists and other numerical experts observed that Apple had skipped a beat. Or rather had skipped iPhone 9.Rationalist logicians insisted this was because it was the iPhone's 10th anniversary, so Apple wanted to celebrate that. I couldn't help thinking it was just as likely because Samsung had already released its Galaxy S9, so an iPhone 9 wouldn't sound so exciting. And, well, it had an exciting new notch, so it needed an exciting new name.
I still mourned the loss of the 9. It was symbolically awkward that the iPhone had lost its ninth life.Now, however, a rumor has emerged that the iPhone 9 might rise from the dead. Japanese site MacOtakara is suggesting that the rumored new iPhone SE 2, which may or may not emerge in March, will actually be called iPhone 9. This new phone will allegedly have a 4.7-inch screen, and, goodness, a home button.
It'll surely be for those with slightly smaller hands and tiny suspicions about Face ID. It'll also be a charming trip to the past -- something shiny, but reassuring. Like Michael Bublé. Some say MacOtakara has purveyed reliable rumors in the past. I wouldn't dream, however, of venturing the actual possibility of this gap in my life being filled.I hope, however, it is. Not merely for the satisfaction of a sequence restored, but for the adorable prospect of Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, attempting to give a deeply nuanced explanation for the name.After all, he's already admitted that the XR in iPhone XR means negative squat. What tale could he concoct to justify the belated appearance of the iPhone 9? Will he claim nine is Tim Cook's favorite number? Will he insist this was always Apple's devious plan? Oh, I know. He'll say it's a spontaneous homage to Apple's neighbors, the San Francisco 49ers after they actually reach the Super Bowl again. (Disclosure: No, not a Niners fan.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">How the demise of the headphone jack led to a ear buds boom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ear buds, or hearables, are driving a boom in wearable devices, according to IDC data. It all started as vendors started dropping the headphone jack en masse.
The returns to technology vendors for ditching the headphone jack are becoming increasingly clear. IDC reported that global shipments of wearable devices including ear-worn buds hit 84.5 million units in the third quarter, up 94.6% from a year ago.IDC said wearable market share gains were driven by hearables, also know as ear buds. IDC analyst Ramon Llamas noted that the hearables boom "began with multiple vendors removing the headphone jack from their smartphones, driving the move toward wireless headphones."And now ear buds are getting new functionality and form factors to further drive sales and there's a mass market to be had. The wearable market is dominated by earwear, a market that is enjoying a boom partly due to the end of the headphone jack on smartphones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's new monster $6,000 Mac Pro is about to ship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple says it about to start selling the new Mac Pro, as well as the $5,000 Pro Display XDR and its $999 stand.
Apple quietly informed some fans that it will start shipping the Mac Pro and its eye-wateringly expensive Pro Display XDR and stand from December 10, as spotted by a customer who received the company's "save the date" email on Saturday.  
The new devices were showcased last June at the Worldwide Developers Conference in an effort to woo creative professionals. Apple had announced that the Mac Pro and the Pro Display XDR would start shipping this fall.The updated Pro hardware made waves at the time for being "an absolute monster of a workstation", with the entry-level Mac Pro including an octa-core Intel Xeon CPU and supporting 32GB of memory. Since then, Apple has also specified that the device can be ordered with an additional 8TB drive. SEE: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)But it was the Pro Display XDR that stole the show. Its 32-inch display and 6K resolution, along with P3 and 10-bit color built-in as well as automatic color adjustment, are likely to seduce graphic designers, photographers and other creative professionals using workstations. 
The XDR Display has to be purchased with a separate stand, which uses a Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect to the Mac Pro and can support up to six displays. The workstation is particularly suited to video editors and photographers who work with HDR images and footage.While the revamped Mac Pro – which is the first major upgrade of the device since 2013 – promises better performance, it was the new products' price that was the talk of the town. 
The Mac Pro comes at $5,999, while the XDR Display is priced at $4,999 and its stand, at $999. The catch? The Mac Pro doesn't come with a display, and the display doesn't come with a stand.Altogether, users will be looking at a $12,000 budget to use Apple's new workstation.  So Apple is banking on the promise of highly sophisticated technology to win back customers who historically may have preferred the Cupertino giant's hardware but have increasingly spent their money with competitors.Microsoft, for instance, is gradually attracting users away from Apple with the Surface range. The Surface Studio 2 compares well to the iMac Pro, boasting a Core i7 processor, a high-end GPU, and a high-definition display with 3:2 aspect ratio. SEE: 30 things you should never do in Microsoft Office (free PDF)But the Surface Studio 2 starts at $3,499. Microsoft's prices are already cheaper than the iMac Pro, which ships at $4,999.Apple is hoping to compete with ever-more sophisticated products, or so it seems, but we shouldn't expect them to be affordable anytime soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Windows 10 Mobile is over: Prepare for final security patches as support ends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No more Windows 10 Mobile security updates after December 2019's Patch Tuesday.
Tuesday marks the end of Microsoft's failed bid to get the world on Windows Mobile, Windows Phone or Windows 10 Phone. Come December 2019 Patch Tuesday, it will be the last time Microsoft ever offers security updates for devices running Windows 10 Mobile. 
The end of Windows 10 Mobile patches is not a huge deal in itself. After all, even Microsoft execs and Microsoft's co-founder, Bill Gates, have moved on to using mostly Samsung Android phones.     But the day is a marker for what Gates has described as his biggest mistake as CEO of one of the world's biggest software companies. Last month he opined that the world would be on Windows Mobile if he had not been distracted by his self-made antitrust problems in the US and Europe.    "There's no doubt that the antitrust lawsuit was bad for Microsoft, and we would have been more focused on creating the phone operating system. And so instead of using Android today, you would be using Windows Mobile," Gates said, explaining Microsoft was just three months late delivering Windows Mobile to Motorola, just as Motorola launched the Moto Droid in 2009.SEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF)
Microsoft's lifecycle FAQ page doesn't capture the drama smartphones caused to Microsoft. Instead it dryly states: "Windows 10 Mobile, version 1709 (released October 2017) is the last release of Windows 10 Mobile and Microsoft will end support on December 10, 2019. The end of support date applies to all Windows 10 Mobile products, including Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise." Microsoft has conducted an orderly and firm withdrawal of Windows Phone support ever since its current CEO, Satya Nadella, wrote off the $7bn-plus Nokia devices acquisition carried out under former CEO Steve Ballmer. 
Last month it announced it would shut down the Windows Phone 8.1 app store on December 16, leaving users with an option to download apps ahead of that date. Some Lumia users could update to Windows 10 Mobile, but come the January 2020 Patch Tuesday date, there will be no more security updates. Of course, Microsoft is gearing up for the release of its new dual-screen Surface mobile devices, which consist of the Android Surface Duo and the Windows 10X Surface Neo. Microsoft in November began inviting interested developers to its preview program so it could "share how developers can unlock this new era of mobile creativity" without having to change too much code in existing apps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fortnite on Google Play: Is a 30% cut worth the security benefits?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Opinion: Google says there are no exceptions. Should Epic Games bite the bullet?
After Fortnite launched on the Android mobile operating system, users were made aware that the installation process was somewhat unusual.
Rather than visiting the Google Play Store and downloading the software directly, Epic Games employed a different installation technique known as sideloading, which requires the app to be downloaded from another source; in this case, Epic Games' website. Adding additional purchase or installation barriers to consumers in a market where easily-accessible and streamlined processes have become a priority is generally frowned upon and is not considered best business practice. In this case, however, the Fortnite developer wanted to avoid Google's requirements when it comes to in-app billing.  As of this year, Epic Games says there are roughly 250 million active Fortnite players, and when you combine this with the app's virtual currency V-Bucks -- used to purchase everything from outfits to weapons in-game -- you can see the potential profit margins.  Market tracker Edison Trends estimates that Fornite in-app revenues dropped by 52 percent between Q2 2018 and Q2 2019, but the game is still a cash cow that outstrips everything else on the market with billions of dollars already banked. 
Currently, developers must adhere to terms of service which include the implementation of Google Play In-app Billing to make in-app purchases, rather than their own payment methods. So when you consider a commission rate of roughly 30 percent levied on in-app purchases made by apps hosted on Google Play, you can see why the developer may wish to protect this revenue stream.  A 9to5 Google report emerged over the past week which suggested Epic Games had submitted Fortnite to Google Play in the hopes of a special exception to the 30 percent rule. 
Google said no. See also: Fortnite is being used by criminals to launder cash through V-BucksIn a statement, the tech giant told the publication:
This is no surprise in itself as if Google made one exception -- especially to a massively popular app -- more developers would come knocking at the door asking for special treatment.  Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has previously described Google and Apple's 'tax' as "a high cost in a world where game developers' 70 percent must cover all the cost of developing, operating, and supporting their games." Sweeney also cited "economic efficiency" as a reason for maintaining sideloading rather than pay the commission, but the decision has been met with criticism by the security community.  CNET: IoT devices need built-in security standards, UL saysGoogle Play is not an untouchable gold standard in security as, on occasion, malicious apps do circumvent existing security controls and become hosted in the official Android app repository.  However, it is generally considered wise to download apps from sources such as Google Play and the Apple App Store as these companies are constantly improving their security measures and there is less of a chance that the software you are downloading is malicious as external researchers, too, are monitoring the stores.  Downloading an app from a third-party website requires high levels of trust in these sources as they are not checked for malware, and they also require users to enable the "allow unknown apps to be installed" setting to be enabled on handsets.  It is this avenue that can be exploited by attackers to perform phishing, Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks and to download malicious payloads on to devices. TechRepublic: Analysts worry about tech security threats ahead of 2020 electionsShortly after the launch of the Android version of Fortnite, Google disclosed a vulnerability in the Fortnite installer APK which could be exploited to allow attackers to hijack the app through a Man-in-The-Disk (MiTD) attack, leading to the substitution of packages for malicious code, high privileges and permission levels to be granted, and device hijacking. At the time, Sweeney branded the disclosure, made a week after a patch had been developed, as a way to "score cheap PR points." Check Point, too, found a bug in Fortnite's infrastructure which gave attackers access to user accounts with very little effort. Over nine million Fortnite accounts were reportedly hacked last year. It does not, and should not, just come down to money. We've seen in the past that it can take no more than one overlooked security issue to bring a company's reputation crashing down, landing them a hefty bill to repair the damage and for compensation, and while a 30 percent rate may be high, users do benefit from an improved app security posture.  As Fortnite does handle payment data, the need to maintain adequate security is even more important considering its massive customer base. The company has launched schemes to try and boost app security, including rewards for users that enable two-factor authentication (2FA). However, given that the app does tend to have a younger audience that may be more susceptible to phishing, downloading installers from untrusted sources, and giving away the keys to their accounts unwittingly, choosing to stay with sideloading could end up costing the company -- and its customers -- far more in the long run than Google's commission.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bridges in major cities are crumbling and in desperate need of inspection. Technology convergence offers a light at the end of a rickety tunnel.
Infrastructure is literally crumbling in many major cities. Fortunately, a number of new technologies are converging to assist in overdue inspections of vital infrastructure such as road and railway bridges."Typically, municipalities or private companies send out a large team of inspectors and need to close certain sections of the bridges to traffic," says Michael Diener, engineering manager at StrucInspect, a company focusing on improving on that method with technology. "And some areas are hard or impossible for a human inspector to reach, creating the risk that a defect might go unnoticed."Drones and 3D cameras can help. Vienna-based StrucInspect overcomes these challenges with an innovative service based on 3D modeling and artificial intelligence. The company captures thousands of images from drones and terrestrial cameras to create a precise 3D replica of the structure's exterior and interior—including hard-to-reach places. Then customers receive a full report, including a textured, 3D mesh model that they can turn and zoom with ½-millimeter precision. With over 65,000 bridges in Austria and Germany alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally, the market for a product suite like that is potentially massive. But the solution comes with some major challenges. Chief among them, the sheer computing power it takes to process all that data.Building textured 3D mesh models from thousands of high-res images requires powerful processors and graphics processing units (GPUs). So does editing the models, which contain hundreds of gigabytes, to remove extraneous details like piles of leaves or snowdrifts. 
StrucInspect's solution is a tale of cloud success. "To work in the cloud we needed a 'native' workstation experience—no lag or latency," says Diener. StrucInspect found its solution in Teradici Cloud Access Software on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). StrucInspect chose GCP because of its AI platform, Python compatibility, and NVIDIA GPU options, including the Tesla P100. 
Before discovering the Teradici solution the company had tried open-source Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for a few months. But VNC is not designed for visualization or to support USB devices like mouses. The company's photographic measurement specialists were frustrated by seconds of lag whenever they tried to open, manipulate, or edit a model. In contrast, Teradici Cloud Access Software, powered by the PCoIP protocol, is highly responsive even for full frame-rate 3D graphics."Using Teradici Cloud Access Software with GCP and NVIDIA GPUs is literally like working on a local workstation," Diener says. "Files open immediately—not several seconds later as they did with VNC—saving up to 30 minutes on a typical 8-hour project. We can turn the 3D models left, right, and upside down and peer into little crevasses with the same experience we'd have on a local workstation." Security is also a big concern, particularly when dealing with issues of vulnerability related to infrastructure. No information ever leaves the cloud because only encrypted pixels travel over the network to the laptop display, where they're decoded. And StrucInspect now has the flexibility to switch from Linux to Windows remote workstations as needed because Cloud Access Software supports both operating systems. Diener concludes, "For our business, Teradici Cloud Access Software on GCP is increasing efficiency, productivity, and work satisfaction. Our users couldn't believe they could work in the cloud with a native experience. It's a world of difference."For the rest of us, we can breathe a little easier knowing bridge inspections are happening faster and more comprehensively than ever before.

    <h5 class="mb-1">LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen, long-term test: Two screens good, but beware bulk and battery life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen is an interesting and affordable alternative to a folding-screen handset, but it does have some significant drawbacks.
While companies such as Samsung work on their folding-screen handsets, LG has taken a different approach. The LG V50 ThinQ, which is available in the UK on EE 5G, offers two entirely separate screens, and a second handset with a similar design -- the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen -- got a full review from my US colleague Matthew Miller back in October ("an affordable two-screen device that is better for productivity than the Fold"). I've been using the LG G8X for several weeks, and have some longer-term thoughts to add into the mix. The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen isn't available in the UK through official channels at the time of writing, so there's no UK price to quote here. When that changes, we'll update this article. In the US, the handset costs $699.99 (down from a launch price of $949.99), which is positively affordable compared to Samsung's $1,980 Galaxy Fold. As with the V50 ThinQ, the second screen attaches to a standalone handset via a case cover. This makes for a big, chunky phone to carry around. The handset on its own measures 159mm by 75.6mm by 8mm and weighs 192g. The Dual Screen hinged case has the second screen on its inside. The case measures 165mm by 84mm by 14mm thick and weighs 139g. The handset slips inside a frame that holds it securely in place, bringing the two-screen device weight to a hefty 331g. SEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF)I go into this detail because whatever the second screen has to offer, you have to consider the size and weight factor. I found the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen too large for most of my pockets, so it had to sit in a bag much of the time, making basic tasks like taking a call or checking an appointment much more of a hassle than usual. On the other hand, I didn't want to leave the second screen at home -- if you've got it, what's the point of not having it with you? An IP68 rating for dust/water resistance and MIL-STD 810G compliance provide reassurance that this is a sturdy device.
The screen cover has a huge cutout on the back for the cameras, while buttons on the outer hinge for volume and power map onto the handset's buttons. These work fine.
The bottom of the case has cutouts for the 3.5mm headset jack and speaker grille. My favourite wired headset fitted fine and felt secure. The handset charges via USB-C, but rather than provide a large cutout for cable to access the port, LG has come up with a separate, small, magnetic charge dongle. I found this arrangement irritating. First, I had to remember to carry the dongle around. Second, leaving it permanently fitted to a charge cable is not convenient: if, like me, you use one cable to charge multiple pieces of kit, that little dongle will need to be kept safe and not get lost. Good luck with that. 
The charge dongle is held in place with magnets, which I found to be far from ideal. There were several occasions during testing when I thought I'd left the phone charging only to come back a few hours later to find the dongle and handset had parted company as things had been moved around my desk or I hadn't ensured a firm connection in the first place. Thankfully, wireless charging is also available.The practicalities of charging will matter if you want to make full use of the second screen because it's a real battery drain. With just the main screen in play you'll get pretty good life from the 4,000mAh battery: over a four-hour period the LG G8X ThinQ lost just 19% of its charge when running a YouTube video continuously in full screen. It's a different story when it comes to the dual-screen configuration: with the main screen on but doing nothing and the same video looping full-screen in the second screen, the battery lost 67% of its charge in four hours. This phone actually has three displays. The reverse side of the second screen has a smallish display of white text on a black background that gives the time, date and some notifications. It's just for information -- not for interaction -- but is quite useful. Still, it's how the phone and second screen work together that will make or break this handset's popularity. The hinge on the second screen cover rotates through a full 360 degrees, so that the screens can be set back to back. I couldn't think of a single situation in which I wanted to use this: most often. the screens were either flat on a desk or with one raised up in laptop mode. As a writer, I found the ability to have a word-working app in one screen and keyboard in the other only marginally useful. In laptop mode there's little speed or comfort gain over the usual handset keyboard, while in portrait mode the screen splits with half the keyboard on the left, and half on the right. Some people might be OK with this, but I just found it awkward. Overall, I'm not convinced of any real productivity gains over using conventional typing techniques on a phone.
You can spread content across both screens in portrait and landscape modes. In portrait mode the huge 'spine' down the centre of the screen gets in the way, but it works a bit better in landscape mode. Still, it's not a patch on simply having a larger screen in the first place. The gaming mode with a virtual gaming controller on the main handset screen and the game itself on the second screen is better -- but remember that battery life issue (gamers will need ready access to mains power). I used the second screen as a viewfinder to take photos occasionally, but most useful of all was running two separate apps full screen -- reading an ebook on one while doing a myriad of everyday things on the other, for example, or comparing two web pages. Using the second screen is remarkably easy thanks to a mini sidebar menu that you can pull out with a quick tap on the right edge of the main screen. Once this is visible it's easy to swap content between the left and right screens, switch in and out of dual-screen mode and, if you're viewing content at the time, to use 'wide view' across both screens as just described. The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen has a flagship-level specification. Both screens are 6.4-inch OLED displays with 2,340 -by-1,080 resolution and in-screen fingerprint recognition on the main screen. The Snapdragon 855 chipset with 6GB of RAM powered the handset to impressive three-pass average Geekbench 5 scores of 2702 (multi core) and 744 (single core) -- see the Geekbench browser for comparative Android handset results. There is 128GB of internal storage, of which 103GB is free for use. This can be boosted with a MicroSD card, which will sit in a caddy next to the single SIM. A 32MP front camera is fine for selfies, while at the back there are two cameras: a 12MP sensor with an f/1.8 lens and OIS and a 13MP sensor with an f/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens. It's not the triple- or quad-camera setup that so many handset-makers offer these days, but it's good enough for general-purpose photography. Android 9 is, inevitably, augmented with various tweaks -- notably, for controlling the second screen -- but there's no intrusive overlay here. It's been interesting using the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen for a long-term evaluation. The second screen has proven useful for using two apps at once, but not for working with text, while gaming is a positive experience but a real battery drain. The battery suffers generally when both screens are in use, and the miniature USB-C dongle makes charging more troublesome than it should be. The phone is also large, heavy and too big for my pockets.  The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen is certainly an interesting and affordable alternative to a folding-screen handset, but it does have some significant drawbacks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google is also rolling out an update to its memory management to ‘proactively compress’ background apps.
Google has started running “feature drops” for its Pixel smartphones as part of a new way to regularly provide users with the latest features.
The tech giant is rolling out the first package from Monday, which includes greater photo editing controls, allowing handset owners to blur the background of images, even if they were taken sometime ago.
As part of the update, Google said Pixel 4 devices in the UK and Ireland will be “soon” receive a new faster and more helpful voice-powered Google Assistant.
The new Recorder app is due to arrive on older generations of the Pixel, while Pixel 3 and 3a handsets will be able to experience Live Caption, the company’s new AI-driven audio captioning option.
Google said it will also roll out an update to its memory management to “proactively compress” background apps in a bid to make the Pixel run more smoothly when multitasking.
Users in the US only will have an additional feature, automatic screening of robocalls to silently filter out cold calling – if it’s not spam, a description of who’s calling and why is provided, so users can decide if they wish to pick up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A real looker with an executive feel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a packed field of stylish competitors, to stand out from the crowd takes a bit of doing.
Step forward Mazda. The new Mazda3, is without doubt one of the lookers in the compact family car market.
Sleek, svelte, feline, particularly this exclusive model in pretty unimaginatively named Polymer grey livery, (I prefer gun metal grey), matched with privacy glass, dark alloy wheels.
New for this year, it offers a huge range of standard equipment across the range, as well as high-end pieces of kit normally associated with executive/luxury brands.
The front features a sloping low nose with large front grille with lowered air scoop, flanked by slim light clusters which feature LED lighting.
The rear lights are incorporated into the high boot line and rounded off with twin exhausts.
There are five trim levels: SE-L, SE-L Lux, Sport Lux, GT Sport and GT Sport Tech..
All models feature head-up display with Traffic Sign Recognition,Radar Cruise Control, plus sat nav and smartphone connectivity via Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and an impressive eight-speaker audio system.
This model also included a reversing camera, multi-function steering wheel, smart keyless entry, heated front seats and frameless rear view mirror .
The interior is the best yet with the model featuring black leather seats with powered adjustment, and heated steering wheel.
The cabin has an executive feel, with soft touch plastics throughout and although the leather and trim makes the interior dark, it is nicely offset with chrome detailing throughout.
The firm says it takes a minimalist approach with every aspect of the cockpit laid out in perfect horizontal symmetry with the driver to deliver both ergonomic simplicity. If that means comfortable, then it is.
All models feature a seven-inch colour TFT driver instrument display, and the brain of the car is the 8.8-inch central display, controlling sat nav, infotainment and connectivity via central a control dial.
It exudes comfort and luxury although leg and headroom is slightly restricted for rear passengers.
This model features a two litre 122PS petrol engine which delivers plenty of grunt. Mated to a slick-shifting six-speed gearbox, it feels like a real driver’s car with plenty of shifts for maximum performance. Refined and free revving, acceleration is brisk, if not startling, hitting 60mph in around 10 seconds.
Brisk performance is accompanied by excellent handling, sharp steering and a firm ride.
Mazda says its SkyActiv-Vehicle Architecture is intended to optimise ride, refinement and handling and it certainly feels the case as the car turns in sweetly to corners, always feeling well balanced with the driver in control.
The only slight setback is the firm ride, which can be unsettling over rougher roads. As a hatchback the car needs to be practical with good stowage and storage space.
The Mazda3 is a family car and meets its role with plenty of oddments room in the front and back together with a decent sized easy to use boot which dramatically increases capacity as the offset split rear seats are folded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McLaren reveals track-focused 620R</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">High-performance machine is limited to just 350 units
McLaren has announced a road-legal version of its GT4 race car – the 620R.
Limited to just 350 units – all of which will be hand-assembled at the firm’s factory in Woking – the 620R shares much of its componentry with McLaren’s track car.
Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 610bhp and 620Nm of torque, the 620R takes the title as the most powerful car in McLaren’s Sports Series.
It’ll crack 0 to 60mph in just 2.7seconds and hit a top speed of 200mph, sending its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed DCT gearbox. Thanks to features such an adjustable carbon fibre rear wing, the 620R can generate up to 185kg of downforce.
The 620R also benefits from the race car version’s adjustable coilover dampers, with 32 individual settings available per corner. Its cornering performance is bolstered further thanks to stiffer anti-roll bars, carbon-ceramic brakes and ultra-sticky Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tyres.
Inside, the air conditioning has been removed, while the carpets and glove box have been removed in the quest for lightness. That said, the audio system and navigation – removed as standard – can be put back in at no extra cost.
Both driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fibre bucket seats with six-point harnesses, while the shift paddles, steering wheel spokes and centre console have all been crafted from the ultra-light material.
As mentioned, the 620R is limited to just 350 units, with each one commanding a £250,000 price tag. European and American buyers get a McLaren track day, featuring expert tuition, included as part of the car’s price, too. Production is set to commence in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vivo V17 with 6.44-inch hole-punch display, quad cameras launched in India for ₹22,990 ($323)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vivo today introduced a new mid-range smartphone in India, called the V17. Unlike the V17 that was launched in Russia last month, the Indian variant comes with a tiny hole-punch display and has an L-shaped quad camera array on the back.
The new Vivo V17 sports a 6.44-inch E3 Super AMOLED display with a tall 20:9 aspect ratio and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. Powering Vivo's latest mid-range smartphone for the Indian market is an 11nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage.
Vivo V17's L-shaped quad camera array includes a 48MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor for portrait shots. Housed within the tiny hole-punch cutout on top of the phone's display is a 32MP selfie camera.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
Keeping the lights on is a 4,500mAh battery, with support for the company's 18W Dual-Engine fast charging technology. The Vivo V17 also features an optical in-display fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the software front, it runs on Android 9.0 Pie OS with Vivo's Funtouch OS 9.2 on top.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Esports startup PatronGG has announced it has secured a $1 million seed investment for its esports engagement platform, Kokyo.
The funding was led by Bitkraft Esports Ventures, supported by Trust Esport.
PatronGG is developing Kokyo as a platform to connect esports organizations and fans through social channels, news, and video content from multiple locations across the internet. It will also include monetization and subscription options for organizations to earn money from their fan communities.
"Trust Esport is proud to partner with Bitkraft Esports Ventures to support the creation and the launch of Kokyo," said Trust Esport founding partner Mattieu Dallon. "Interactions between esports clubs and their fans are essential but currently lack structure. This investment is part of our ambition to develop platforms and apps to widely spread esports content and to monetize esports audiences in a sustainable and profitable way for all players in the ecosystem, and especially the clubs."
This adds another esports investment to Bitkraft's recent string, which has included esports mobile startup Meta Games, MMO developer Playable Worlds, esports music startup Five Vectors, gaming broadcast network VENN, and accessible development platform maker Manticore Games.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The team behind The Elder Scrolls Legends has ceased development on the game.
In an announcement to the game's community via Reddit, the publisher announced that all new content developer or releases have been put "on hold for the foreseeable future."
The game's roadmap had previously suggested one more expansion pack would be released before the end of the year, but these plans have been scrapped.
However, Bethesda has assured that it will continue to support the game with regular in-game events and reward cards every month, as well as ongoing maintenance support.
It has also clarified that the development and release for the Asia-specific version, which operates separately, will not be affected and will "inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward."
It was further stressed that both versions of Legends would continue to operate after the launch of the Asian edition and will not be merged, keeping their player bases separate.
It's not clear whether the plans for the console versions of The Elder Scrolls Legends have been scrapped as well. GamesIndustry.biz has reached out to Bethesda for clarification. The publisher announced it would be bringing the game to Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch at E3 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UPDATE 9/12/19: Platinum's pair of Vanquish and Bayonetta remasters are now official. As we reported last week, both will launch on 18th February 2020 with a 10th Anniversary Bundle containing both games.
On PlayStation 4, digital versions of the game will also unlock a pair of static console themes.
Here's our first trailer:
ORIGINAL STORY 5/12/19: Microsoft has listed new remasters of Vanquish and Bayonetta on its official store for release on 18th February 2020.
"Remastered for the first time on Xbox One," each game's description reads. "4K graphics at 60FPS available for Xbox One X."
A 10th Anniversary Bundle of the two games together has also been spotted (thanks, All Games Delta).
Publisher Sega is yet to announce either remaster. We're checking now in case there's anything official yet to add.
Vanquish Xbox One screenshots.
First released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2010, Platinum's sci-fi shooter Vanquish was later launched on PC in 2017. We suspect this latter version is the one being polished up for Xbox One (and, likely, PS4). Perhaps, considering Platinum's close relationship with Nintendo, there will be a version for Switch as well?
As for Bayonetta, well it is of course already available for Switch - but not for PS4 or Xbox One. We'll update here when we have official word.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finally, PlayStation gets cross-platform Minecraft tomorrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At last, Minecraft will launch its cross-platform version on PlayStation 4 tomorrow - Tuesday, 10th December.
The game's Bedrock build is currently available and offers cross-play between (deep breath) Xbox One, Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, iPhone, Android and Gear VR.
Existing owners of Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition will "begin updating" to the Bedrock version then, Microsoft said today in a press release.
Just as when this happened on Xbox One, the Bedrock version will arrive as its own separate game client. You'll still be able to play the old PlayStation 4 Edition if you own it already, but it will no longer be available to purchase.
Disc-based versions of Minecraft: PS4 Edition will unlock a download for Minecraft's Bedrock edition.
You'll need an Xbox login to play Minecraft's Bedrock edition on PS4, Microsoft confirmed to Eurogamer. But of course you do not need to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber.
"A free Microsoft or Xbox Live account allows all Minecraft players to track progress and purchases across platforms, now including PS4," a spokesperson told Eurogamer. "The paid Xbox Live Gold service is not required to play Minecraft."
Oh, and you won't unlock Xbox achievements, the spokesperson confirmed. Instead, PlayStation owners will unlock trophies.
So, why now? Here's what Microsoft said when we asked:
"This has been a big year for Minecraft - we've been making major changes to the game and taking steps in new directions, but our original vision for connecting players across devices and having the best experience regardless of platform will always stay true.
"We've been talking to our partners at Sony about this for a while, and think now is the right time from both a studio and community perspective to bring PS4 players along on the Bedrock journey."
The arrival of Bedrock on PS4 marks the end of a long wait for PlayStation fans. Up until now, Sony's console has been the last to use Minecraft's specially-developed console version, ported by Scottish outfit 4J Studios, as opposed to the Bedrock client which has become the default Minecraft version on Switch and Xbox One. Recent additions include a character creator, and foxes and bees. Next up is a big update for the Nether.
We'll likely hear more during tomorrow's PlayStation State of Play livestream, scheduled for 2pm UK time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's a day of the week that ends with a 'Y' so you know what that means. Yep, eBay is back at it again with another voucher code. This one is pretty special, though, as you can use it to save 10 per cent off any purchase over £100 across the site.
There are no retailer restrictions as with other eBay codes (at least from what I've seen when browsing) so you can find some terrific savings at stores such as Argos, AO, Currys PC World, Ebuyer, Scan and more. All you need to do is enter the code 'PROSPER10' at the checkout and you can save up to £50 off a single purchase.
Now, we'd be here until the code expires trying to pick out absolutely everything that's best to buy using this latest voucher. Instead, I've listed a few highlights for you to peruse below. There are console bundles - including the Nintendo Switch - along with lots of other top tech savings:
Consoles:
TVs:
More tech:
If nothing there grabs you, why not take the trip over to eBay and search for whatever you'd like to make a saving on. As long as its £100 or more, the 'PROSPER10' can be applied to get 10 per cent off - up to a maximum of £50.
Remember, though, that the code expires on 10th December so you've only got today to make use of it. It's a great chance to snap up some last-minute Christmas bargains - especially if you missed out on anything you wanted during the Black Friday sales.
We'll continue to update this page for the rest of the day if we spot any other great offers hidden away. You can also give us a follow over at Jelly Deals and on Twitter for a rolling feed of all the best bargains using this latest eBay voucher!

    <h5 class="mb-1">First Humble Choice bundle launches featuring Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Blasphemous and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in October, it was announced that the Humble Monthly subscription service would be undergoing a rework to become Humble Choice. Well, the first edition of the new bundle format is live.
Now, instead of paying a regular fee upfront and getting access to a mystery bundle of games each month, Humble Choice allows you to pick from a diverse selection depending on your membership level.
Here's the full list of ten games you can choose from in the Humble Choice debut:
Premium members who pay £15.99 a month get to choose nine games from the above list to add to their collection forever. You also get access to the Humble Trove library and a chunky 20 per cent off at the Humble Store.
The Basic tier will set you back £11.99 a month and allow you to pick three games from each bundle. That also comes with Humble Trove access and 10 per cent off at the Humble Store.
There's also a £3.99 a month Lite tier, but with that you only get to dip into the Humble Trove along with 10 per cent off at the store.
What do we think of this new format, then? To me, the value seems a little off-kilter with the Basic plan as with that you now have to pay more money each month for about a third of the games you'd get before. Pick smartly, though, and you could find yourself a decent saving if you sign up on a month-by-month basis.
For example, if you get Lara's latest globetrotting relic-thieving misadventure Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the grotesque/gorgeous action-platformer Blasphemous and cold war strategy gem Phantom Doctrine in the December bundle you'll be saving around £50 compared to buying them at full price.
And at least you can't miss out on a good bundle now, too. You can simply wait and see what games are up for grabs each month before you get to make your choices, so it's all about signing up for the months you like the look of instead of paying in advance and hoping you get something good.
In any case, if you like the look of some of the games available this month you can sign up for Humble Choice right here. If you previously had a Humble Monthly membership, you'll have been automatically enrolled into the Humble Classic tier, which gets you all ten of each month's games for your old subscription price. Not bad, there!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Witness Spooky Evidence of Snapchat's New Face-Swapping Feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes social media dipsomania comes into harsh relief, as it did today when the technology wars manifested themselves as the ability to superimpose your face on a cat: aka, Snapchat’s new social drug “Cameos.” It’s terrifying.
As TechCrunch first reported, Snapchat has selectively released a beta version of a feature which allows users to scan their faces and insert them into a collection of 150 video clips hurtling toward the camera, like surfing, flinging money, hoovering up a mountain of pastries, and, per TechCrunch’s preview, a cat screaming “FEED ME.” They follow the maniacal logic that brought us pizza on a building. The eyeball injections are so addicting that they make me envision a Black Mirror scenario of the last man on earth sending a Snap of his face on a cat to himself:
You can select a friend to add to a Cameo:
TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine tweeted a demo:
Snapchat must keep rolling this shit out if it wants to get your attention, vying with new kids like TikTok and competitors that rip them off, as Apple did with Bitmoji, and Instagram with stories, filters, and stickers. It’s been noted that Snapchat is ripping off JibJab, and bears some resemblance to the deepfakes of Zao, but it doesn’t appear to be going for realism. Snapchat also needs to stay on its spectacular rebound after a turbulent year of plunging earnings and users, and it very publicly freaked out about that. You can swap genders! Age yourself! 3D spectacles: now in Gucci! Meanwhile it’s been quietly tidying up the messes, like reorganizing its disruptive redesign. Last week the Information also reported some murmurings of a plan to sort out the Discover tab chaos, with a dedicated “news” section for journalistic Snapchat shows like NBC’s Stay Tuned.
The new one could satiate the same irresistible desire which captivated us with filters, except an even more frantic and aggressively cheerful bid to hook users who feed data to these apps because we can not resist the urge to put our faces on things. I’ve never felt more like an infant in my adult life. Or it’s just a fun feature. That’s always possible.
Snap tells Gizmodo that they will be unrolling Cameos on December 18th.
This post has been updated to include confirmation from Snap.

    <h5 class="mb-1">21 Tips to Make Google Docs, Sheets and Slides Work for You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides have evolved to become very component online productivity tools, enabling you to churn out documents, spreadsheets and presentations from any computer (with other collaborators, if necessary). But are you taking full advantage of everything these web apps have to offer? These 21 tips will save you time, improve your work, and help you do more with these apps.
Set up a row of bookmarks with docs.new, sheets.new, and slides.new in them, and you’ve got a one-click way of opening up new documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in your Google Drive—think of all the seconds you’ll save by not using the menus each time.
Don’t let a break in internet connectivity slow you down by enabling offline editing and file creation in Docs, Sheets, and Slides: From the main Google Drive screen on the web, click the cog icon (top right), then choose Settings, then tick the checkbox next to Offline.
If you do use Google Drive on the web to get at Docs, Sheets, and Slides, you can open the same Settings pane (see above) and fit more files on the screen at once, via the Density drop-down menu—you get to choose between Comfortable, Cosy, and Compact.
Google Docs on the web recently added the option to see your word count rise (and fall) in real time, which might help you hit your deadlines faster. Pick Tools and Word count, then tick the box marked Display word count while typing (other stats can be shown too).
Have you ever run the experiment to see if you can speak faster than you can type? In Google Docs on the web, click Tools and Voice typing, then try dictating documents rather than tapping them out (you might be surprised at how good the transcription is).
Did you know you can link between documents? When you hit Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on a Mac), just paste in the file URL or search for it in the link box; you can replace “edit” with “preview” at the end of any Docs URL to link to a cleaner version of a document.
Docs, Sheets, and Slides come with more than just a simple undo option—they offer a layered version history so you can go back to that version from last Sunday you really liked, or from before that guy from accounts got involved. Click File then Version history.
Docs comes with an Automatic Substitution tool that works a little bit like the autocorrect on your phone—you can use it to preempt common mistakes or even to use shortcuts for certain words and phrases. Select Tools and then Preferences to make changes to the list.
Docs lives on the web, so you can drop in a few new fonts with ease: They can revamp the look of a document and even boost your productivity. Click the font drop-down on the toolbar, then choose More fonts, and you can browse through a wide selection of typefaces.
Google Sheets is more versatile in terms of layouts than you might have realized: Use the Text rotation button on the right of the toolbar on the web to put text at a certain angle. Either pick from one of the presets that appear, or enter an angle for the text manually.
Sheets will ping your inbox as soon as there’s any change to a shared spreadsheet, if you like: Click Tools then Notification rules to configure the way this works. You can pick between getting alerts straight away and getting a daily email digest of all the changes.
Keyboard shortcuts are of course one of the ultimate productivity hacks, and Docs, Sheets, and Slides have got a bunch of them you can make use of. To see the keyboard shortcuts at your disposal, choose Help then Keyboard shortcuts from inside one of the web apps.
Take some of the strain off your aching fingers by assigning macros to common tasks in Google Sheets—if you open up the Tools menu you can click Macro then Record macro to register keystrokes and clicks that can then be replayed at any time with a shortcut.
Having multiple people work on one spreadsheet in Sheets can make it hard to keep track of what’s what, and to ensure certain data stays fixed. By selecting a group of cells, right-clicking, then choosing Protect cells, you can put limits on who can make edits.
Google Sheets works nicely with a host of third-party plug-ins and services, including the always excellent IFTTT (If This Then That). It’s possible to create automatic feeds for all kinds of useful data, from the info stored on your fitness tracker to the day’s weather.
There’ll be plenty of times in Google Slides where you want to make an identical copy of an object or text box, and the web app includes a useful shortcut for this: Hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Option (Mac), then click and drag an object to make a duplicate next to it.
Don’t panic if you only want to show part of a YouTube video inside one of your presentations in Slides, because this can be organized for you: Right-click on the video, choose Format options, and look under the Video playback settings on the right.
You want your presentations to look their best, so make sure your slides are neatly arranged. From the View and Guides menu, use Show guides to display guidelines, and Edit guides to modify them. Make sure View, Snap to, Guides is selected as well.
If you’re wrangling with trying to create something on a slide, an add-on can probably help—select Add-ons then Get add-ons to see what’s on offer. They cover interactive questions, flowcharts, music notation, live polls, maths equations and much more.
You might often need to build a new slide that’s very closely matched to one that you’ve already created. Right-click on a slide thumbnail on the left and choose Duplicate slide.
When it comes to presenting your Slides presentations, why not make use of Google’s own Chromecast technology, if it’s set up wherever you are? It’s simple and reliable, and you can connect by clicking the arrow next to Present, then Present on another screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Calendar finally lets you move events across calendars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re a frequent user of Google Calendar you’ve probably noticed that the Android app has far fewer features than the desktop version. The desktop is typically viewed as the more “productive” platform, but tons of people rely on their phones for productivity as well. Google is now bringing a long-time desktop feature to Android: moving events between calendars.
Google Calendar for Android has had the ability to copy and duplicate events for a while, but this left the event on multiple calendars. Now, through a server-side update, you can move an event from one calendar to another. To move an event, go into the Edit interface for an event and you can tap the calendar at the top to move it.

This is much more convenient for those times when plans change or you mistakenly create an event on the wrong calendar. As mentioned, this is a server-side update, so you can’t simply update the app to get it. You can try force closing and clearing the cache, but that may not work either. We’re glad to see Google continue to work on bringing the mobile version of Google Calendar up to feature parity with the desktop.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google’s first “Pixel feature drop” includes post-snap Portrait Mode, auto Call Screen, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this month, Google rolled out the December Android security patches. The company made some changes to the format they have traditionally used for these monthly releases. Instead of listing “functional patches” on the Pixel Bulletin, Google moved them to the Pixel Community Forum. Today, the company announced another change to how Pixel devices will receive updates with the first-ever “Pixel feature drop.”
Google describes Pixel feature drops as follows:
This inaugural feature drop includes a couple of great features. First, we’ll start with Google Photos. Portrait Mode is a great feature in the Google Camera app, but it does require you to proactively switch modes before snapping a photo. You will now be able to retroactively turn on Portrait Mode on Pixel devices with Google Photos.
Next up is automatic Call Screen on Pixel devices, which is something we discovered in an APK teardown. Google Assistant can automatically screen unknown callers and filter detected robocalls before your phone rings. If the call was not a robocall, your phone will ring a few moments later and show context about who is calling and why. You can find transcripts of these calls in the Dialer app. Google mentions that this is an update to Call Screen specifically on the Pixel 4.
There are a few other odds and ends included in the feature drop. Google Duo gets smoother video calls on poor connections thanks to sound prediction with machine learning and the 90Hz display on the Pixel 4 helps reduce choppiness. Duo also has a new Portrait Mode-esque filter. Memory management has been “enhanced” across all Pixel devices so you can run more apps at the same time. Google also highlighted the features that users discovered in the last security update.
So that’s it for the first Pixel feature drop. This is essentially a rebranded and much more consumer-facing approach to the “functional patches” found in security updates. Google can elaborate on the features much more and make sure users know what’s new.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Ultimate Sit-Stand Desk Costs Less Than You Think</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you sit at a desk for long periods of time every day you’ve likely heard about the supposed health risks associated with it. You’ve also probably done some research on sit-stand desks and found out that they can be pretty expensive. The prices have come down a lot recently, but you can still easily spend over $500 for a fully motorized standing desk. Autonomous is a company making high-quality standing desks, and the SmartDesk 2 Home Office is more affordable than you might expect.
The key to actually using a standing desk as often as you should is for it to be convenient. Some of the cheaper “standing desk” options are devices that you place on your desk and have to manually lift up. There are also some integrated desks that use a manual crank for raising and lowering. These sound like good ways to save some money, but in the end, they become a nuisance and you revert to sitting. A standing desk with a built-in motor and preset heights is the easiest solution, and you don’t have to pay a lot for it with the Autonomous SmartDesk 2 Home Office.
The SmartDesk 2 Home Office starts at only $329 and it includes everything you need: frame, desktop, motor, and controls. The control pad includes an LED display, simple up and down arrows to raise and lower, plus 4 programmable height settings. Once you find the perfect height for sitting and standing, you only have to press a button once to go there. The desk rises smoothly and quietly, so you don’t have to worry about your coffee tipping over.
You can customize the look of your desk with a number of color options. For only $329, you can mix and match between white, black, walnut, and white oak tops and white, black, or grey frames. You can also spend a little more and get a bamboo top for $379 or get a bigger 70.5 x 30-inch top for $419. With all of these options, you can make sure the desk fits in with your office decor.
Autonomous has a few other standing desks to choose from as well. The SmartDesk 2 Business Office has a three-segment frame that can go up to 52-inches and start at $399. The L-Shaped SmartDesk has a large footprint that’s perfect for corners and starts at $529. Autonomous also offers an Art Desk, a curved Executive desk, a Double Desk, and a DIY kit that doesn’t include the desktop. Autonomous also offers chairs, standing mats, and other accessories to deck out your office.
Improving your health and focus at work doesn’t have to be costly. The Autonomous SmartDesk 2 has all the bells and whistles you could need, plus plenty of customization options to fit in any workspace. Don’t wait any longer to try out a standing desk!

    <h5 class="mb-1">OPPO Enco Q1 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Earphones Review — Accurate Marketing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earphones are great. They let you listen to what you want to without disturbing others. And, more importantly, they let other people listen to what they want to, without disturbing you. Today we’re going to take a look at the OPPO Enco Q1 wireless noise-cancelling earphones.
While many companies are hopping on the true-wireless bandwagon, OPPO went for something completely different. These earphones have a stiff neckband, similar to the LG Tone series, but it is flexible and contoured. Having a neckband comes with its own sets of advantages and disadvantages, which I’ll talk about later. OPPO is advertising up to 22 hours of battery life, active noise cancellation, great sound, and incredible comfort with the Enco Q1. How accurate are these statements? Does the title give it away? Maybe, maybe not. Read on to find out.
“Oh God, he’s starting out by talking about the box again, isn’t he?”
Yes, yes I am. The box that the OPPO Enco Q1 comes in is actually pretty big. It’s only about an inch tall, but it’s nearly a foot in both other dimensions. There’s a reason for the size, though, and it has to do with how these earphones are constructed. Besides the earphones themselves, OPPO includes some manuals, a charging cable, and a bunch of replacement tips. Interestingly, there are actually four sizes here; the ones that come installed are in between the medium and large replacement tips in size. There’s no charging case, but that’s because these aren’t true wireless earphones.
The design of the Enco Q1 is pretty similar to the older LG Tone models. There’s a neckband, which is where the battery and controls are, and the earphones are attached by wires. In the age of truly wireless earphones, you might wonder why you’d ever want to get a pair that are both tethered and have the extra weight of a neckband. Well, maybe you don’t ever want to, and that’s perfectly fine. But there are a few good reasons for the band, which I’ll get into later as well.
Finishing off the first impressions, the OPPO Enco Q1 has your usual handy prompts for power and connection state and such. Oh, they also have this little thing called Active Noise Cancellation. Maybe you’ve heard of it before? Active noise cancellation can be great if you want to listen to something in a noisy environment, and I was super excited to see that OPPO included it. How well does it actually work, though? Well, let’s get started with the actual review to find out.
Since the OPPO Enco Q1 has a neckband, you won’t find capacitive touch controls on oi. Instead, there are four physical buttons on the left side of the band. One button is for changing the EQ mode and toggling noise cancellation. The volume rocker is for changing the volume or the current music track. The last is for powering the Enco on or off, enabling pairing mode, playing or pausing music, and answering or ending calls. You can also do a quick double press to trigger the voice assistant on your phone.
There’s nothing super fancy here, but that means it’s also super easy to remember (and get used to) which button does what, and the fact that you get proper tactile feedback when you’re doing something is always nice to have. Unlike earphones with capacitive controls, it’s much harder to accidentally pause your music or skip a track.
OPPO has opted for a simpler, less-feature-creepy approach to controls here, and, in my opinion, it works well.
I mentioned it earlier, but this thing has a neckband. For a lot of people, that might be a little off-putting. After all, neckbands can be heavy and get in the way. On its website, OPPO says that “you’ll barely notice it’s there,” and, honestly, it’s true. Usually, you need to take whatever a brand claims on its website with some skepticism, but this is at least one thing on the product page that’s completely true. Unless I’m doing sit-ups or something that involves a lot of movement, I don’t even notice I’m wearing the Enco Q1, thanks to its 42g weight.
Now that I’m done gushing about the neckband, let’s actually talk about how the earphones fit. The OPPO Enco Q1 actually comes with four tip sizes. That means there’s plenty of choices if they don’t fit you right away. Once you find the right tip size, the Enco Q1 is plenty comfortable. I’ve worn them until they run out of battery without my ears getting sore or uncomfortable.
There are just two things to keep in mind when you’re putting the earphones in. The first is that you need to sort of twist them into your ears. If you’re used to noise-isolating in-ear earphones, this won’t be anything new. The second involves the noise cancellation feature. Because the OPPO Enco Q1 uses microphones facing into your ears for noise cancellation, if you twist them in while the feature is active, it’s possible they’ll make a high-pitched squealing noise. I usually just put up with that possibility, but it’s a good idea to just turn off the noise cancellation while you’re putting the earphones in.
When they’re not in your ears, the neckband of the OPPO Enco Q1 makes for a pretty convenient way to hold and anchor the earphones. Just take them out of your ears, stick them together (each bud has a magnet in the back for this reason), and forget about them. Well, forget about them until you lean forward. The wires attaching the earphones to the neckband are pretty long. While that’s good for reachability and in-ear comfort, it means they can get in the way when you don’t have them in your ears. For example, when leaning over a sink, there’s a real risk of getting them wet. They are IPX4-rated, but that doesn’t mean they won’t break at all as IPX4 is good only for light splashes of water.
The magnets that hold the earphones together are also not very strong, and I’ve had them come apart a few times. That’s not a big deal by any means, but it’s definitely something worth keeping in mind.
One last thing for this section, I promise. The OPPO Enco Q1 are rated IPX4. That means you don’t need to worry about wearing them in the rain, or for an intense workout. You shouldn’t go swimming with them, obviously, but an unexpected rain shower won’t cause any problems.
I’ve worn the Enco Q1 until they run out of battery. With active noise cancellation enabled, OPPO claims the Enco Q1 will last for about 15 hours of playback. Without active noise cancellation, that number jumps to 22 hours. Again, the marketing here is spot-on, at least for the ANC mode. I’ve had no trouble getting 15 hours or more of playback time out of the Enco Q1. I’ve barely used them without ANC enabled, so I can’t personally say how accurate the 22-hour estimate is, but I am inclined to believe it. Those 15 hours of playtime are more than enough for almost any general use-case, and it’s so nice not having to worry about charging these every few hours.
Now let’s talk about the other end of battery life: the charging process. OPPO says it takes about two hours for the Enco Q1 to charge, which isn’t exactly quick. But you don’t really need fast charging when you can just plug them in overnight. Thankfully, the OPPO Enco Q1 charge with USB-C, so you don’t need to carry around a Micro-USB cable with you. Your phone charger will work just fine.
Features and playback time are nice and all, but what about sound? The features don’t mean much if the sound quality is terrible. Well, no need to worry. The OPPO Enco Q1 sounds great, thanks to the 11.8mm dynamic driver. The default EQ profile is perfect for my preferences. Treble and vocals are clear, but there’s also bass when it’s needed.
Of course, if you’re someone who likes heavier bass, what I just said may not really sound that great. Maybe the Tronsmart Spunky Pro sound like more your jam. Lucky for you, the OPPO Enco Q1 comes with a few different EQ modes: music, cinema, and gaming. If none of those work for you, there’s always your phone’s built-in equalizer. ColorOS is pretty bad, but it does have an equalizer, and One UI has some pretty advanced sound control if you have a Samsung.
But what about the noise cancellation feature? I’ll admit I was a little skeptical of this actually working well, but after over a month of using it, I’m pretty happy. Obviously, it isn’t perfect. These are just in-ear earphones, not headphones. But for what they have to work with, the OPPO Enco Q1 provides a solid noise-cancelling experience.
I’ve actually taken to using the noise cancellation in lectures to help tune out noises like coughing and sniffing. On the train to and from home, the Enco manage to block out nearly all of the noise from the wheels on the track. I’ve even started to turn my headphones volume lower than usual, since there’s just so much less background noise to overcome. Needless to say, I really enjoy the noise cancellation feature here, and I wish more earphones had it.
So we’ve talked about sound quality and noise cancellation, but there’s one more thing to cover: the microphone(s). On top of all the microphones for noise cancellation, the OPPO Enco Q1 has at least one more for other regular functions like phone calls, video calls and apps like Duolingo. I’ve actually made a surprising number of calls with these and I never got complaints about the clarity of the phone call.
Honestly, I’m incredibly happy with the OPPO Enco Q1. From the comfortable design to the amazing battery life and the excellent sound quality, they get so many things right. That doesn’t mean they’re perfect, as the magnets could definitely be stronger, but OPPO did a great job designing them.
You can get yourself a pair of the OPPO Enco Q1 for around $100 online. That’s not exactly cheap, but it’s half of what Apple charges for noise-cancelling earphones. Unless you really want true-wireless noise-cancelling earphones, these are a pretty great deal. Of course, if you don’t care about noise cancellation in the first place, then that doesn’t really matter. But with the 22-hour playtime and great sound, noise cancellation isn’t the only reason to buy these. The Anker Soundcore Spirit Pro may “only” be $50, but the sound is nowhere near as good, and the playtime is less than half of what the OPPO Enco Q1 manages.
I know $100+ is a lot to ask for a pair of earphones, but I really do think these are worth the price. Unfortunately, they’re a little hard to find. They’re not sold officially in very many countries. If you’re in China, you can get them directly from OPPO’s website. Users in India can buy them from Amazon India for ₹7,990. For other regions, check Amazon or eBay. Depending on the seller, you can find them for as low as $80 or $90.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ring is branching out from its usual doorbells and security cameras to produce truly connected lighting, although it's probably not going to replace your corner table lamps any time soon. An FCC filing has revealed that the Amazon-owned firm is prepping a Bluetooth-capable light bulb. It appears to be a floodlight that would complement Ring's existing security systems, but it's still a significant step for a company whose dedicated lighting has so far been limited to self-contained systems rather than screw-in bulbs.
It's not clear when Ring's bulb might arrive. CES 2020 is around the corner in January, but there are no guarantees Ring and Amazon will launch then. Whenever it arrives, it'll be good news for those who want to catch would-be thieves and aren't put off by Ring's privacy issues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's first CES appearance in 28 years is all about privacy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple hasn't had an official presence at CES since the Newton's debut in 1992, but it's about to come back... in a very modest way. The company's Senior Director of Global Privacy, Jane Horvath, is due to speak at a roundtable where she and her peers will share their beliefs on what customers want for privacy protections. There won't be an announcement, a keynote or a booth, then -- this is really about articulating views to industry and the press.
In addition to Apple, you can also expect execs from Facebook and Procter & Gamble as well as FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter.
Apple has had an unofficial effect on CES in the 28 years since its last formal appearance. The more Apple-centric Macworld Expo frequently took place in a similar time frame, and it occasionally upstaged everything at CES -- it's no secret that the iPhone unveiling stole much of CES' thunder in January 2007. There have long been reports of Apple staff roaming the show floor to scout the competition, and Apple not-so-subtly trolled rivals at CES 2019 with an ad that made its privacy position clear. Throw in the many, many companies bringing Apple-oriented accessories to the event and the company has been hard to escape.
Still, this is a notable step. It's unlikely that Apple will return to announcing products at CES when the company is well-known for wanting control over when and how it conducts launches. This does, however, indicate that Apple is more willing to engage with the rest of the industry, if just to get its message across.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After launching in a limited, invite-only beta earlier this year, GOG Galaxy 2.0 is now available to anyone who wants to try it. You can join the open beta by visiting the GOG Galaxy website and downloading the new client on your PC or Mac.
As before, owner CD Projekt says the goal of its app is to unify your disparate game libraries and friends lists in one place. While you'll still need to have launchers like Steam and the Epic Games Store on your computer, GOG Galaxy 2.0 allows you to install and play any games you may have on those platforms using its client. You can also link your Xbox and PlayStation accounts to GOG Galaxy 2.0, allowing you to see your console games as well -- no need for a spreadsheet. At the moment, GOG Galaxy 2.0 supports 20 platforms, either officially or through community-made integrations. Some of the bigger ones include Steam, Origin, Uplay and the Epic Games Store.
We took a look at GOG Galaxy 2.0 earlier this year when it was in closed beta. At the time, the client didn't have a lot of features, but it did allow us to organize the majority of our games. Since then, GOG has been busy at work adding features that enhance the platform's original pitch. With its latest patch, for example, GOG Galaxy now allows you to see the online status of your friends across different gaming platforms. It's a nifty feature that makes it easier to pull your buddies into an online game like Destiny 2. GOG Galaxy 2.0 probably won't spell the end of store exclusives like Hades and Metro Exodus, but it will least make them easier to handle.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this year, Domino's Pizza said it would let you track your pizza deliveries using GPS. And, well, the company is now delivering on that promise. Domino's announced today that approximately a quarter of its locations across the US will have the technology in place by the end of this year. In 2020, a "significant portion" of Domino's remaining locations will allow you to track your order through the company's mobile app.
If the Domino's Pizza you're ordering from supports GPS delivery tracking, you'll also be able to opt into text notifications. By doing so, you'll get messages when your pizza is two minutes away and when it has arrived at your door. Domino's will also send you an SMS when your food is on its way. In this way, you can track where your order is without constantly looking at the Domino's app.
The chain is no stranger to technology, especially when it comes to tech that has the potential to streamline deliveries. Earlier this year, the company said it would start testing autonomous delivery vehicles in Houston. However, it's a bit strange to see Domino's come so late to GPS. After all, unlike autonomous robots, GPS is a mature technology that has been around for a while.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Bayonetta’ & ‘Vanquish’ bundle comes to PS4 and Xbox One in February</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, multiple retailers leaked the existence of a Bayonetta and Vanquish bundle for PS4 and Xbox One. Today, we have confirmation that the compilation is on its way and that the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X owners will be able to play the games in 4K at 60 FPS. Collectors will be happy to learn that the physical version will come packed in an embossed SteelBook case.
Gamers who have already played these cult classics may want to give them another whirl in 4K, while those who haven't owe it to themselves to try them out. Bayonetta is arguably one of the best 3D action games around. It borrows from the Devil May Cry formula -- developer PlatinumGames is made up of several Capcom vets -- but is even more frenetic, stylish and ridiculous. Vanquish puts a Japanese twist on the western third-person over-the-shoulder action game with a tokusatsu-style power suit, loads of crazy weapons and an addicting power-slide mechanic.
A quick word of caution for PS4 gamers: The PS3 port of Bayonetta was outsourced to another developer and is riddled with issues; it's the one version of the game to avoid. It would be a bummer if the PS4 version of the bundle uses this same port. If that's the case, it might be a good idea to grab both the bundle and some other version of Bayonetta such as the Xbox 360, Steam or Switch release. That said, if Sega is going through the effort to upgrade the game to modern standards, it seems somewhat unlikely that it would use a version of the game known to be second-rate.
If you don't care about the SteelBook case, you may want to pre-order the digital version of the game to get a free console theme, at least for PS4 -- we haven't heard anything about pre-order bonuses for Xbox One owners yet. Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle will be out on PS4 and Xbox One on February 18 for $39.99. Bayonetta 3 was announced as a Nintendo Switch exclusive almost two years ago to the day. Since then, we've heard very little. But hopefully this bundle is an indication that PlatinumGames is still dedicated to the series.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar's I-Pace software update boosts the range by 12 miles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Car makers frequently make vague claims that their racing technology leads to improvements in road-going vehicles, but this is one of those precious few moments where the gains are very tangible. Jaguar is delivering an update to its I-Pace EV that promises up to 12 miles of extra range thanks partly to know-how gleaned from the eTrophy race series. The automaker has boosted the efficiency of the car's AWD torque distribution, reduced use of the radiator vanes that keep it cool (improving aerodynamics) and allowed the battery to run to a lower state of charge without compromising performance or durability.
Other tweaks simply come from real-life driving data. The regenerative braking system is more effective at recovering energy at both low speeds and high battery levels, while range predictions should be more accurate and indicative of your driving style.
Unfortunately, the update process isn't as slick as it is with EV-focused brands like Tesla. You'll have to visit a Jaguar dealership to get this upgrade. Take heart, though: the same update also allows for more components to receive over-the-air updates, potentially sparing you some repeat visits in the future.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over two and a half years after Microsoft said it'd one day kill to-do service Wunderlist in favor of its own To Do app, it has revealed when it'll drop the ax: May 6th. After that time, Wunderlist's to-do lists won't sync anymore and you'll have a limited time to export lists from there into To Do. As of today, Microsoft won't accept any more sign-ups for Wunderlist.
Microsoft bought Wunderlist creator 6Wunderkinder in 2015 and announced To Do (or To-Do, as it was known then) in April 2017. It launched a redesigned version of To Do in September, which brought the service closer in line with Wunderlist's feature set while deepening its integration with several Microsoft services, including Outlook, Microsoft Planner and Cortana.
The plan to put Wunderlist out to pasture has been in the works for a long time. Despite founder Christian Reber's offer to buy back the service, it'll wind down in less than five months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus adds Netflix to its TVs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When OnePlus made its TV debut, releasing its OnePlus TV Q1 series in India this September, it noticeably left Netflix out of the picture. Now, Android Police reports that OnePlus is bringing the Netflix app to its TVs via a system update. Newer models will ship with Netflix preinstalled, and a redesigned remote will come with a dedicated Netflix button.
The new remote will fix a few other issues. The original was remarkably similar to Apple's TV remote, but in an attempt to be sleek, OnePlus didn't include a mute button. Instead, users had to press both volume buttons at once. The new remote will be thicker, made of plastic (rather than metal), run on AAA batteries and include dedicated mute and Netflix buttons, says Android Police. In other words, OnePlus is no longer trying to imitate Apple's less-than-perfect remote design.
The TVs are still only available in India, but it's interesting to see how they're developing ahead of what we can only assume will be a wider release. Both the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro are 55-inch 4K QLED panels with support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. They started at INR 69,000 ($972) and INR 99,900 ($1407) respectively.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You no longer need an Android phone if you want to keep your Google Maps activity (mostly) private. Google is rolling out Incognito Mode to iOS users as of today, giving you the same ability to search for and navigate to locations without leaving records behind on your account or Location History. Again, this won't affect Assistant queries or prevent outsiders from theoretically snooping on your Google Maps traffic -- this is mainly so that Google (and anyone with access to your phone) won't know what you've been looking for.
Android users are getting an additional privacy control of their own. There will soon be a bulk delete option for your Timeline so that you can quickly remove a group of places you've visited without venturing into Maps' settings and specifying date ranges. This could be particularly helpful if you've been looking for gifts and would rather not spoil the surprise when your partner borrows your phone. The feature will miss the holidays with its January rollout, but hey -- it'll be ready for next year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You don't have to wait until 2020 to try Oculus Quest hand tracking, at least so long as you're willing to accept some limits. Oculus is trotting out the controller-free input method as an option in the "Experimental Features" menu this week. You can only use it in the main interface as well as first-party apps like the web browser and Oculus TV, but that still allows you to ditch the grips for common tasks. You can switch back to controllers through a quick toggle in the home screen.
The hand tracking test will be available to you once you've updated the Quest to v12.
Third-party apps with hand tracking won't come until 2020. However, Oculus will offer a development kit next week that will make hands-only control available. The technology won't necessarily make sense in every app. We can imagine it being a particular problem in games where your hands might be out of view of the headset's cameras. It's a start, though, and there may come a time when you only pick up the controllers when you absolutely need them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's new depth feature makes its AR experiences more realistic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google has been experimenting with ARCore for the better part of two years, adding more features to its AR development platform over time. Back at I/O this year, Google introduced Environmental HDR, which brings real world lighting to AR objects and scenes. Today, it's incorporating a Depth API that will introduce occlusion, 3D understanding, and a new level of realism.
Google is first bringing this new Depth feature to search, which it introduced earlier this year with augmented reality animals. For example, if you search for the word "cat", you'll see an image of a 3D cat in its Google search card. Select "View in your space" and the app will access your camera, showing you the cat in the real world around you. To see the capabilities of ARCore's new Depth API, you can also then enable or disable occlusion. When disabled, the cat will float above the environment, but when enabled, the cat will be partially obscured behind furniture or other real-world objects.
On top of that, Google has also partnered with Houzz to incorporate this Depth API in its home design app. Starting today, Houzz users can see how this works with the "View in My Room 3D" experience. Now, instead of just placing furniture in the room, the new occlusion option will let you see a more realistic preview of how furniture will really look in a room. So, for example, you'll be able to see a chair behind the table, instead of floating on top of it.
In a demo at Google's San Francisco office, I saw how developers could use the new ARCore Depth API to create a depth map using a regular smartphone camera; red indicates closer areas while blue are for areas that are further in the distance. Also, in addition to occlusion, Google says that having this depth understanding of the world also allows developers to play with real-world physics, surface interaction and more.
One example that I tried out was when I threw virtual objects in a real-world living room setup. The digital objects respected the curvature and angles of the furniture, piling up in a narrow cavity or spreading all over the place in a wider, flatter space. Virtual robots climbed over real-world chairs, and virtual snow fell on each individual leaf on a real-world plant. One particularly fun demo was when playing a virtual food fight, where I could use real-world furniture as barricades.
According to Google, all of this is possible with the over 200 Android devices out there that are already ARCore-compatible. It doesn't require specialty sensors or equipment, though the addition of new sensors in future will likely make the tech even more lifelike.
Aside from Google's search and the new Houzz app, ARCore's Depth API isn't implemented in other consumer applications just yet. If developers are interested in trying this out in their own projects, they'll have to fill out this form to apply.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Minecraftfans on PlayStation 4 will be able to play with their buddies on other platforms such as Xbox One, PCs and mobile devices starting Tuesday. Mojang is at last updating the PS4 version of its colossally successful title to the Bedrock version, which will finally enable Minecraft'scross-platform play on Sony's console.
The update, which should be available on PS4 at 11AM ET/8AM PT, will also bring the Minecraft Marketplace to the console. You won't have to pay extra for the Bedrock update, and those who buy Minecraft on the platform from now on will also get cross-play access.
Players on all platforms will need to be running the 1.14 update to take advantage of cross-play. The update has been a long time coming for PS4 players, as Xbox One, Switch, PC and mobile Minecraft fans have been playing together for 18 months.
Minecraft's PS4 cross-play arrives after Sony relaxed its restrictions on cross-play over the last year or so. It opened up cross-platform multiplayer access to all developers in October. Several other major titles offer PS4 cross-play, including Fortnite, Rocket League, Call of Duty: Modern Warfareand PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was only a matter of time before China started offering trade bans to US companies in return for the ban on Huawei's gear. The Financial Times is reporting that Beijing has ordered all government institutions and public bodies to get rid of their foreign (i.e. western) computer gear. According to the report, China will spend between now and 2022 transitioning off American hardware and software in favor of local alternatives.
This isn't the first time that China has publicly (and not-so publicly) declared American technology as persona non grata within its government. But the move may have more urgency this time as the country looks to push back against the broader geopolitical picture. Not to mention that other nations, like Russia, are also doing their best to push domestic technology onto their citizens.
China is also looking for ways to better control the internet and keep its data within its borders, following the 2017 China Internet Security Law. One of its tentpole features is a rule to ensure that all technology is "secure" and "controllable," which is, as usual, particularly troubling.
Companies likely to face pain include Microsoft, who already has a testy relationship with the country, Dell, HP and Apple. Although it's worth saying that, as with any technology product sourced from around the world, what constitutes a domestic product. After all, the FT uses Lenovo as an example: a Chinese company that sources chips from Intel (US) and hard-drives from Samsung (Korea).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Do you know the way to San Jose? It doesn't matter if you're in a self-driving car. As they previewed earlier this year, Bosch and Mercedes-Benz have commenced trials for an automated ride-hailing service in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose. To start with, autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz vehicles (with safety drivers at the wheel) will shuttle "a select group of users" between North San Jose and downtown.
The busy San Carlos/Stevens Creek corridor between west San Jose and downtown should be good test for the self-driving tech used by Mercedes and Bosch. Rather than just playing with prototypes, the companies want to create a production-ready SAE Level 4/5 self-driving system that can be built into different makes and models. To do that, they're using a combination of AI, a million-square foot proving ground in Stuttgart and the real world San Jose ride-hailing tests.
San Jose is expected to grow by 40 percent over the next two years, so the city wants to see the impact of autonomous cars. "We want to know more about how automated vehicles can help improve safety and reduce congestion, as well as make mobility more available, sustainable, and inclusive," said San Jose project director Dolan Beckel in a statement. "If automated driving is to become everyday reality, the technology has to work reliably and safely."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung’s Galaxy S11+ Could Come With a Custom 108MP Camera for Enhanced Image Quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S11 flagship won't be for another couple of months. However, leaks keep painting a picture for all of us looking forward to the device and what it will have in store for users. The latest leak regarding the handset states that the Galaxy S11+ will be equipped with a whopping 108MP camera sensor for enhanced image quality. Let's dive in to see some more details on the Galaxy S11+ 108MP camera and what can we expect from the larger sensor.
As mentioned earlier, the camera sensor is physically larger than the traditional smartphone cameras. Samsung will use a 1/1.3-inch 108MP sensor and in contrast, the Galaxy S10 boasts a 1/1.255-inch 12MP sensor. If the leak ever sees daylight, we can expect the primary sensor on the Galaxy S11+ to be substantially bigger, even bigger than what Huawei uses in its Mate 30 Pro.
Low-Res Galaxy S11 Live Images Pay Close Attention to Large Rear-Mounted Camera Hump
Apart from this, the leak suggests that this is not an ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor, but a custom sensor for enhanced picture quality. Since it is a custom sensor, we can expect it to be more expensive compared to the 108MP sensor on Xiaomi smartphones which we have seen recently.
One of the major aspects bolstering the superior image quality is the larger sensor. Conjoined with better image processing, low-light photography along with dynamic range could potentially receive a major boost since the sensor would be able to take in more light. If you're unfamiliar, here's how the Galaxy S11 looks in these leaked images.
The 108MP primary camera on the Galaxy S11+ will be one of the five cameras which are rumored to be part of the mix. Other sensors include an ultra-wide-angle shooter, a ToF sensor and a 5X Telephoto sensor. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for more details on Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S11+ camera and more.
This is all for now, folks. What are your views on the Galaxy S11+ 108MP camera sensor? Are you looking forward to it? Sound off in the comments, we would love to hear it from you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy S11+ could use a custom 108MP sensor for superior image quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new leak pertaining to the Galaxy S11+ points to Samsung using a massive 1/1.3-inch 108MP sensor on the handset.
Apart from 108 million pixels, the sensor itself is also physically bigger than a traditional smartphone camera sensor. For comparison, the Galaxy S10 comes with a 1/2.55-inch 12MP camera, while the Huawei Mate 30 Pro features a 1/1.7-inch 40MP sensor. This means that if the rumor ends up being true, the primary camera sensor on the Galaxy S11+ will be substantially bigger than what Huawei uses in its smartphones as well.
This is not the same 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that Samsung has developed in collaboration with Xiaomi. Instead, the Korean company apparently plans on using an "exclusive custom sensor" that offers superior image quality when compared to the 108MP camera sensor we have seen so far in a couple of Xiaomi smartphones. This custom sensor will also be more expensive than the 108MP Bright HMX sensor.
Apart from sensor quality and image processing improvements, the bigger sensor on the Galaxy S11+ will give it a major advantage in low-light scenarios. The dynamic range will also be better as the bigger sensor will be able to absorb more light.
The Galaxy S11+ is expected to come with a penta-camera setup which apart from the 108MP camera is expected to include an ultra-wide angle shooter, a 5x telephoto sensor, and a ToF sensor.
Rumors surrounding the Galaxy S11+ point to it coming with an 108MP camera sensor that can record 8K videos. The phone will also come with some innovative new camera modes, a 120Hz AMOLED display, and an Exynos 990/Snapdragon 865 chipset along with 12GB RAM. Renders of the Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+ have also already leaked giving us a clear look at their design.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key point: This handgun is compact, reliable, and has sold well.
In 2017, Smith & Wesson refreshed its Military and Police Shield (M&P Shield) series of compact handguns. The result was the M&P Shield 2.0. The M&P Shield 2.0 has all the features of a full-sized pistol in a package small enough for concealed carry. Smith & Wesson also offers the pistol in a wide variety of configurations, from caliber to ergonomics and aiming devices, allowing prospective buyers to pick the version that’s right for them.
The M&P Shield 2.0 is 6.1 inches long with a 3.1-inch barrel. Although Smith & Wesson considers this a compact pistol dimensionally it’s more along the lines of subcompact pistols offered by industry competitors such as Glock and Sig Sauer. The pistol weighs 18.3 ounces unloaded, making it one of the lightest pistols of its kind of the market. Smith & Wesson achieves this by combining a polymer frame, which requires rigidly but not pressure-resistant strength, with an embedded steel chassis that encases the trigger group and action. The frame and barrel are made of stainless steel finished in a black Armornite finish to resist rust and corrosion.
Another key requirement for concealed carry users, a narrow pistol, is achieved by using single column magazines. Most full-size nine-millimeter handguns pack fifteen rounds or more by using a double stack column that greatly increases the number of rounds a handgun can store. The downside is a wider grip that, although perfectly fine for duty carry, makes it more difficult to conceal on a person under clothing. The use of a single column magazine allows the M&P Shield 2.0 to have a width of just .99 inches.
A striker fired pistol, the M&P Shield 2.0 uses a striker instead of a hammer to strike a firing pin, discharging the pistol. The pistol includes a manual thumb safety. Unlike other striker fired pistols, the Shield 2.0 allows for disassembly without pulling the trigger, an important safety feature that adds a measure of safety to the takedown process. Some models include interchangeable palm swell grips of varying sizes to accommodate different hand sizes, allowing the user to create a custom fit.
The M&P Shield 2.0 is available in nine-millimeter with a seven-round flush magazine or an eight-round magazine that protrudes slightly from the magazine well. The latter holds an additional round and also provides a fuller grip for larger hands. Alternately, the pistol is available in .40 Smith & Wesson and .45 ACP versions that hold six and seven rounds, respectively, in similar magazines.
Smith and Wesson offers their compact handgun with a wide variety of aiming systems. In addition to standard, adjustable iron sights, the Shield 2.0 is sold with tritium night sights, HI-VIZ fiber optic sights, integrated Crimson Trace red laser aiming devices, and integrated flashlights. The Shield 2.0 is even offered with a cut frame and integrated four minute of angle red dot sight.
The M&P Shield 2.0 is one of the most popular compact handguns on the market, and it’s not hard to see why. The wide variety of choice, from ergonomics to aiming devices, makes it clear that Smith & Wesson is paying attention to market trends and user choice.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s much-anticipated beast of a machine, the Mac Pro, and its corresponding badass new display, the Pro Display XDR, will be available to order on December 10, per a promo the company emailed to U.S. customers.
Editor's Note: It's currently unknown if this offer extends to Australian customers.
Spotted by Twitter user Marques Brownlee, the announcement doesn’t offer any other details about how Apple plans to roll out its high-tech hardware, though Apple’s careful to word the news as its Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR will be “ready to order” on that date, i.e. shipping time (especially for any so-called cheese graters out there with customised configurations) not included.
The Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR were officially announced in June at the World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), but fans have been chomping at the bit for a redesign of Apple’s ancient, by tech standards, at least, 2013 Mac Pro for years. The company promising that a new overhauled model was on the horizon for the lasttwo years only further fanned the flames.
And, of course, Apple’s most powerful gear comes at an equally premium price, though whether they’re actually worth it is another question entirely. The 32-inch Pro Display XDR starts at $US5,000 ($7,310), while its controversial and separately sold Pro Stand (a literal stand, in case you couldn’t tell by the name), which allows you to tilt and rotate your screen, comes in at a grand.
As for the Mac Pro, models start at $US6,000 ($8,771), which comes with an eight-core Xeon processor, AMD Radeon Pro 580, 16GB of RAM, and a pitiful 256GB of storage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">If there’s such a thing as gaming phone, the Asus ROG Phone II Ultimate is it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The concept of a 'gaming' phone is relatively new, albeit one Asus has embraced, starting with the original ROG Phone and then the ROG Phone II. Who knows when or if a third-generation model will come out. In the meantime, Asus is bolstering its ROG Phone II with an Ultimate model that ups the ante with more RAM and storage.
It's now available in the UK direct from Asus for £899.99, and is up for preorder in the US at B&H Photo for $1,099.99. Or at least I think those are the correct links—keeping track of the variations and SKUs is a little confusing because of the different hardware configurations, matte black and glossy finishes, and different part numbers in different regions of the world.
There are three main models available—Strix, Elite, and Ultimate. Here's a general breakdown of the RAM and storage on each:
The new Ultimate model is the highest-end configuration, which further separates itself from the other two with 4G LTE connectivity supporting downloads up to 2Gbps (Cat 20), versus 4G LTE up to 1.2Gbps (Cat 18) on the Elite and 4G LTE up to 1Gbps (Cat 16) on the Strix.
All three models feature a 6.59-inch AMOLED display with a 2340x1080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and HDR support. The fast refresh rate brings parity between the ROG Phone II and competing models like the Razer Phone (first and second-gen), though Asus claims bragging rights by being first to offer 120Hz on an OLED screen.
This is all powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor clocked at 2.96Ghz with Adreno 640 graphics. There's also a monstrous 6,000mAh battery pack inside.
As with the first-gen ROG Phone, the ROG Phone II (including the new Ultimate model) employs "Air Triggers," which are areas you can tap on the side of the phone to serve as shoulder buttons. This time around, they support both tap and slide motions.
I've spent some hands on time with the ROG Phone II (and the ROG Phone before that). If there's such a thing as a gaming phone, the ROG Phone II is it. Between the powerful hardware (for a phone), innovative Air Triggers, fast refresh rate, large battery, and an ecosystem of accessories, it's probably as close to the concept as it can get, while still being a phone.
It's also a bit on the chunky and heavy side, for a modern flagship, and the aesthetics are decidedly ROG (a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your vantage point). So there's your trade off.
I'm not about to ditch my PC as my gaming platform of choice. Still, the ROG Phone II seems like a prime candidate for Google's Stadia platform, if it's ever supported. As for right now, there's no word from Google or Asus on when or if that will happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero gaming headset review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Turtle Beach is a household name when it comes to gaming headsets, offering reasonable quality devices that range from the cheap end of the scale to the mid-range. The Elite Atlas Aero falls somewhere in the middle of these two, coming in at $120/£130, but what does it offer compared to other gaming headsets at the same price? And where does it really fit in with all the other Turtle Beach offerings from the past couple of years? It’s not the cheapest, nor the most expensive, nor the most feature-packed.
Initial impressions of the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero are strong; the headset is packaged in its folded state, which is ideal for portability. One earcup completely folds into the other, so you don’t have a huge bulky pair of cans to transport. One big complaint I had though was the size of the headband itself; I don’t have a particularly large head but had to extend the headband to almost the full length and, even then, the headset feels tight when worn for lengthy periods. If you’re someone who typically has a big noggin, bear this in mind because the device might not physically fit comfortably.
Price: $119.99Wireless: YesDriver-type: 50mm Nanoclear driversImpedance: 32 ohms @ 1kHzFrequency response: 12Hz -20,000HzDesign style: Over-earMicrophone: ProGaming MicConnectivity: Bluetooth wireless
Setting up the headset isn’t particularly difficult. It comes with a USB bluetooth transmitter, which connects without problem thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions, but unfortunately it’s only compatible with PC. Mac and Linux users are short-changed here, because the Turtle Beach Control Studio is a Windows-only application, and this is where the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero seriously shines. Hardly an issue for PC gamers, but anyone looking to use it across multiple devices is a little short-changed.
The amount of customisation options available is staggering, from simple sliders like increasing the bass and treble to a preset mode dedicated to increasing footstep sounds, the Control Studio has it all. You can create your own presets here too by fiddling with the equaliser for individual sounds like car explosions, wind, vocals, and more. There are also macros to assign to specific functions so you can switch between audio modes at the press of a key, and you can import other people’s optimal settings for the specific game you’re playing.
Perhaps the most impressive part of the Elite Atlas Aero is the “Superhuman Hearing” button. This toggle activates the audio mode of the same name, which means you can hear footsteps and enemy noises from a serious distance away. I’ve played a lot of Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Rainbow Six Siege with it over the last month and the range in that mode is on another level. I’m confident in saying I’ve not heard such game enhancing audio from a headset before in my life, because it gives an incredible advantage. The general audio quality drops, but that’s to be expected. Having the single button on the underside of the left earcup means you can turn it on whenever and start detecting enemies from miles away, while they’re completely unaware.

In the same location is where you’ll find the on/off switch, along with the volume and separate mic monitoring dials (adjust the volume of your own voice for others). The only complaint I’ve got is that thanks to the position of the volume wheel on almost the exact rear of the cup, if you have a tall seat such as a traditional gaming chair, it’s easy to accidentally raise or lower the volume when you lean back by brushing the dial against the back of your chair.
When it comes to the microphone, the Elite Atlas Aero does drop a mark here for two reasons; firstly, the quality isn’t excellent. It’s not bad per se, but I’ve both heard and used better from a wireless mic, like in Sennheiser’s gaming range. It’s also impressively fiddly to plug in the detachable microphone. You have to get the exact rotation before pushing it in quite forcefully, to the point where I wasn’t sure if my attempts were futile. It’s a seriously tricky mic to plug in, which begs the question, why wasn’t this spotted in quality control? Thankfully, as someone who mainly uses a better quality external USB mic, this only affected me for testing purposes and before long I stopped using it again. It’s something to bear in mind though if you don’t have a separate mic to use, because it can cause some issues. 
The Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero product page claims the headset boasts “over 30 hours of battery life” when fully charged, and from my experience that isn’t true whatsoever. The battery life certainly isn’t bad, but if you spend a long 12 hour session using them talking on Discord and enabling the Superhuman Hearing function, you’re going to want to charge them overnight. You’ll be sorely disappointed when they die swiftly the next day if not. Our tests place it between 12-15 hours of normal gaming use.
If you’re not too concerned about the actual quality and instead want an advantage over your opponents in competitive multiplayer games where sound plays a vital role, you won’t find a better headset than the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero. It has serious value-for-money and is one of, if not the best PC headset I’ve used in that regard. There are a few minor drawbacks, but this should be your top choice if you want to rank up online.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What is it? VR stealth game with a neat concept haphazardly executed.Expect to pay $30/£23Reviewed on Oculus Quest (via Oculus Link), Windows 10, AMD Ryzen 5 3600, Nvidia GTX 2080 Super, 32 GB RAMDeveloper Digital LodePublisher Tripwire InteractiveLinkOfficial site
If Espire 1 has taught me anything, it's that crouching is really hard work. Sam Fisher must have thighs made of concrete the way he scuttles around for hours on end. If Ubisoft had wanted to make a truly realistic stealth experience, they'd include a post-mission sequence in which Fisher has to rub Ibuprofen gel into his groin.
In fairness, Espire 1 doesn't simulate the chronic inner-thigh pain that must come with being a professional sneaky bastard either. This just happens to be a by-product of its concept. Finally, there's a VR game that lets you avoid detection by physically crawling through an oversized vent. 
By all rights, this should make Espire 1 the most immersive immersive-sim ever made. Sadly, the reality doesn't quite live up to the dream. Don't get me wrong, Espire 1 has some neat ideas, and there are moments when its VR stealth simulation (quietly) sings. But it also lacks the level of mechanical finesse good stealth games need, resulting in an experience that frequently veers closer to Keystone Cops than Metal Gear Solid.
Espire 1 puts you in the role of an operative working for the Intelligence Force of Australia. The game starts immediately after an attack on one of the IFA's most secure research centres, which specialises in designing remote-controlled humanoid drones. Taking control of one such drone, your job is to infiltrate the facility, find out what the insurgents are doing, and stop them from doing it.
This slightly roundabout premise is necessary to explain Espire 1's unique approach to combating VR-induced nausea. In the game, your character is stood in a Minority-Report-like glass box, via which you control the drone telepathically. When you move the drone around (using standard FPS controls), the static box becomes visible in the periphery of your vision, while only the very centre of the screen maintains what the drone is seeing as it moves around.
These unique "comfort settings" do seem to succeed in reducing nausea by minimising the amount of movement in your peripheral vision. That said, I found the game to be relatively comfortable even with these settings switched off. As Espire 1 is a stealth game, you're frequently stopping to hide, assess guard patrols, and wait for the right moment to move, which helps reduce motion sickness anyway. 
The core of Espire 1 will be familiar to anyone who's played Thief, Splinter Cell, Metal Gear, etc. As you explore the underground R&D facility, you'll need to avoid, distract, or eliminate patrolling guards. If they spot you, they'll raise the alarm, and you'll have to either run and hide until the alerts die down or stand and fight until there's nobody left to respond.
The potential for VR stealth gaming is immediately apparent. Being able to physically lean around corners to check they're clear is very satisfying, as is physically crouching when moving to reduce the amount of noise you make (although there is an optional crouch button if you want to avoid the risk of thigh-cramp). Espire 1 also takes advantage of verticality. Your robot's magnetic hands let you clamber onto any metal surface, enabling you to shimmy up the drainpipe of a warehouse and evade guards by sneaking along the rafters.
Espire 1 is at its best when you're in full evasion mode like this, clambering hand-over-hand on the underside of a metal gantry to avoid the sights of an automated turret. My favourite mechanic is how you activate your infra-red sensors by raising your virtual hand to the side of your head and pressing the trigger of your touch controllers. This instantly gives you a Predator-like view of patrolling guards. It's very cool.
This isn't where Espire 1's neat ideas end either. You can use voice commands to sneak behind guards and shout "Freeze!" holding them up MGS 2 style. Weapons are also fun to manipulate. The bolt-action tranquiliser pistol is cocked by physically retracting the bolt on the back, while conventional weapons can be quickly reloaded by holding the gun over the magazine holster on your off-hand side (Espire 1 lets you specify your dominant hand, which is another neat touch). You can even pull magazines out of enemy weapons for extra ammo, or throw them around the environment to distract enemies.
Espire 1 has all the right components. It just doesn't always fit them together especially well. The biggest problem is AI. Guard perception is highly inconsistent. You can be stood next to them and they might not see you, but they'll spot you up on a gantry on the far side of the room. The game needs a clear, MGS-style indicator of what enemies can see. Placement of enemies can also be problematic. Several times I opened a door to a new area and was immediately spotted. Elsewhere, I've been funnelled into corridors where there's no alternate route to help avoid detection. Compared to the best stealth games—Chaos Theory, Thief II and so on—the levels are not especially well-thought out, with too many open lines of sight and too few hiding places.
Combat, meanwhile, is the weakest part of the game. Your physical inventory is great in theory, but fiddly to use in practice. The pistol holsters are too far back, meaning I'd frequently go to grab my gun and miss, or grab my rifle from the chest holster by mistake. Also, nothing has any sense of weight to it. Guns feel like they're made of Styrofoam, while enemies crumple like wet cardboard when shot. The result is that combat is more absurd than it is thrilling, with you pole-axing a guard because you were trying to grab your pistol and accidentally chucked your assault-rifle at their head. 
With more polished combat and more precision in the level design, Espire 1 would be a decent chunk of VR stealth. It's campaign lasts about six hours, with around twenty short challenge missions on top of that. As it stands, however, it's just a little too fiddly in execution for me to sneakily slip it a wholehearted recommendation.

Espire 1's VR stealth is brimming with neat ideas, but the end product is slightly less than the sum of its parts.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm still waiting patiently for the day when the modding community figures out how to get airplanes and helicopters into Red Dead Redemption 2, but until then this hot air balloon mod by Krank will have to do. Once installed you can conjure up a balloon wherever you are and fly it around freely, getting some amazing bird's eye views of Red Dead's sprawling slice of the Wild West.
The balloon moves way faster than it realistically should. Don't expect to find an accurate simulation of a hot air balloon here. But it's a thrill being able to float around that massive world without being stuck on the back of a horse. The latest version of the mod added inertia and smoother controls, and it even has controller support if you're playing Red Dead with a gamepad.
Installing the mod is as simple as dropping a file into your game directory. Just make sure you have Script Hook RDR2 otherwise it won't work. To spawn a balloon, hit F8 and you're ready to fly. And don't forget to check out our list of the best Red Dead Redemption 2 mods for more ways to transform the game. Just don't go online with mods installed or you might get banned.

“We decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future. This decision will not in any way affect the release and development of GAEA’s Asia-specific version of Legends, which is operated separately, but will inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward,” Bethesda wrote in an update on Reddit.
The game will remain playable — and supported — on all available platforms, Bethesda also confirmed.
“Until then, you can still download and play Legends on all existing platforms and compete online as well as in the single-player modes.

Studio Sparkypants Studios took over development duties on Legends from Dire Wolf back in 2018; it’s unclear how this business decision impacts the studio.
The Elder Scrolls: Legends is currently available on Windows PC, Mac, iOS and Android.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bethesda has recently announced on Reddit that development on their Elder Scrolls themed card title Elder Scrolls Legends is currently on hold for the foreseeable future. The team will still continue to support the game, but planned updates and expansions have been scrapped. It is not clear what this means for the console versions. A Nintendo Switch version was announced at E3 2018 so we shall have to wait and see whether it sees the light of day.
“We would like to provide an update on Legends in regard to new content. Our previous roadmap indicated we would be releasing one more set this year. We decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future. This decision will not in any way affect the release and development of GAEA’s Asia-specific version of Legends, which is operated separately, but will inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward.

We will continue to provide ongoing maintenance support.
To thank you all for supporting Legends these past few years, and for continuing to play with us, we are giving away The Tamriel Collection – an assortment of new, three-attribute cards and more – to all players for free upon their next login. We are immensely grateful to work on The Elder Scrolls: Legends, to have you as a community, and we sincerely appreciate the love and support you’ve given us.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: December 9, 2019 7:36:32 pm
WhatsApp will now support call waiting on Android and the latest update brings this feature.
WhatsApp on Android is now getting the much awaited and useful call waiting feature. The call waiting feature was earlier added to the iOS version of the app, back in November this year. On Android, the WhatsApp call waiting feature has rolled out to both the stable and beta versions of the app. The beta version 2.19.358 and stable versions 2.19.352 and 2.19.357 both get the call waiting feature, according to the information on Google Play Store.
The Call Waiting feature as the name suggests will let users decide whether they want to accept or end an incoming WhatsApp call, while in the middle of another one with someone else. Earlier, WhatsApp would automatically disconnect the incoming WhatsApp call, but now the user interface shows an alert about the other call.
Users have the option of declining the incoming call altogether or to End & Accept, which would be accepting the new incoming call. This will end the earlier call. But this is not the same as call holding that we get on regular telecom lines. WhatsApp does not allow two users to be on the same line at the same time like it is possible on a regular telecom call.
The Play Store changelog for WhatsApp also mentions the new group privacy settings feature, which lets users limit who can add them to a group. It also mentions the fingerprint unlock support for WhatsApp, which means the app cannot be opened by anyone else other than the authorised user.
Update your WhatsApp on Android to the versions mentioned above. APK mirror files of the same are also available online. Once you have updated, the WhatsApp calling waiting is activated automatically, you don’t need to do anything extra.
Once the feature is activated, if you are in the middle of a WhatsApp call, and another call comes, you will be shown two options. The caller’s name will flash with the options Decline or End& Accept as the two options. The same can be seen in the photo we have used above.
Decline is shown in red, which means you are rejecting the incoming call. If you choose End&Accept, then the ongoing call is disconnected and the new incoming call is connected. As noted earlier, WhatsApp does not put the earlier call on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Airtel, Vodafone-Idea remove limit on calls to other networks: Here’s what it means</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: December 9, 2019 7:06:37 pm
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea have both removed the limit on off-net calls or calls outside their network, and put back unlimited calling on their plans.
Earlier this month, both Airtel and Vodafone-Idea introduced their new prepaid plans, which were priced higher than previous ones, and also introduced restrictions on calls to other networks. While calls made within their networks would remain unlimited, both Airtel and Vodafone-Idea had added a Fair Usage Policy (FUP) on calls to other networks or ‘off-net’ calls. Now they have removed the FUP on off-net calls, and once again made their packs unlimited, given the daily data benefits and unlimited calls.
Airtel tweeted, “We heard you! And we are making the change. From tomorrow, enjoy unlimited calling to any network in India with all our unlimited plans. No conditions apply.” Vodafone also tweeted, “Enjoy free unlimited calls to everyone. More reasons for you to rejoice for being on your favourite network.”
For users, this is a win-win. While the prices of prepaid packs have increased overall, the FUP limit on calls to other networks has been removed. This FUP limit meant that if you crossed a certain number of minutes for calls to other networks, you would be charged extra, at the rate of 6 paisa per minutes.
So calls from Vodafone to Vodafone were free, but calls from Vodafone to Airtel, while technically free had a condition attached to them. Plans under Rs 300 were offering 1,000 minutes worth off-net calls from both Airtel and Vodafone. More expensive plans with 84 days validity had higher FUP on calling of 3000 minutes.
For users, this would resulted in some confusion with regards to which calls were free, and which calls would eventually get charged. Now that both Airtel and Vodafone have removed the limit, the prepaid plans go back to unlimited calling as it was offered earlier.
Bharti Airtel also introduced three new unlimited prepaid plans.
Airtel tweeted out a list of three new unlimited calling plans with FUP removed. Two of these plans come with 56 days validity. The first plan of Rs 219 comes with unlimited calls, 1GB data per day, 100 SMS per day. The pack is valid for 28 days, and comes with free Airtel Xstream app, Wynk music and HelloTunes access.
Airtel’s other pack is Rs 399 which has a validity of 56 days, and comes with 1.5GB data per day, unlimited calling to all networks, 100 daily SMS and free Airtel Xstream app, Wynk music and HelloTunes access.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vivo V17 review: Good cameras, slick design but competition is tough</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written by Sneha Saha | New Delhi | Published: December 9, 2019 4:54:43 pm
Vivo V17 review: The phone comes with a 48MP quad camera and a 32MP front selfie camera. Here’s what we thought of its performance. (Image source: Sneha Saha/Indian Express)
With the V17 Pro, Vivo set a new benchmark in smartphone photography thanks to its six cameras. The Vivo V17 Pro set itself up as a phone for camera enthusiasts. And that seems to be the USP all other Vivo phones too are playing on, including the just-announced Vivo V17.
The V17 Pro introduced a dual selfie pop-up camera setup. In fact, the V17 Pro is still the only phone to come with such a camera technology. With the V17, Vivo takes inspiration from Samsung and shifts to a punch-hole camera.
In addition to the front camera design, Vivo has also changed the look of the rear camera setup compared to the V17 Pro. The V17 includes a rectangular camera moduled aligned vertically on the top left corner of the back. The module includes all the four cameras and LED flash. The Vivo V17 looks much better than the V17 Pro which was a bit bulky. The Vivo V17 is extremely lightweight, despite the 4500 mAh battery inside. The phone has the right size and that makes it very easy to use it with just one hand which was difficult with the Pro.

Vivo V17 price in India: Rs 22,990
Vivo V17 specifications: 6.44-inches Super AMOLED display | Snapdragon 675 processor | 8GB RAM | 128GB internal storage | 4500mAh battery with 18W fast charging | 48MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide camera + 2MP macro camera + 2MP depth sensor | 32MP selfie camera | FunTouch 9.2 OS based on Android 9 Pie.
Camera is one of the most important aspects of the Vivo V17, so let’s start with that. The first thing I noticed was that the V17’s camera app was slightly cluttered with too many options on one screen. This often confuses users on which camera mode to try. This is actually a problem with Vivo’s custom skin FunTouchOS 9 that runs on the V17.

I used the phone to click pictures in almost all lighting situations from bright sunlight to low-light. Pictures shot in bright daylight show good amount of details and decent colours. I like the fact that this Vivo phone doesn’t pop the colours too much and captures the right colour-shade, almost. The ultra-wide shots clicked with the phone also look decent, but often miss out on details. The portrait shots clicked with the V17 also turn out to be good, but I would have liked the edges to be slightly more sharp.
The two areas where I believe the Vivo V17’s camera does a great job are with macro and low-light. Almost every picture clicked with Super Macro camera mode showed great details and good colours. The macro mode works best in good lighting conditions.

I have also clicked numerous low-light pictures with the V17 and all of them turned out impressive. The Night camera mode of the V17 captures better details and colours in low-light conditions compared to the default photo mode. The good news is that V17 brings night mode not just for back camera but also for the front and it also works pretty well. The Vivo V17 also clicks great selfies in situations with good light.
The V17 is undoubtedly one of the best-looking Vivo phones of 2019. It looks unique and that is mostly due to different rear camera design and the punch-hole screen on the front. For the first time Vivo opts for a rectangular (vertically) camera module and this adds to the overall design of the phone. Despite the four cameras, the back panel of the V17 doesn’t look cluttered which is great. The smartphone overall sports a clean design. The punch-hole on the front is small, which doesn’t make it look odd. It is much smaller than the camera hole on Samsung Galaxy M40 and Galaxy S10 series.
I loved watching movies and YouTube videos on the V17 thanks to the big, bezel-less AMOLED screen that produces punchy colours and offers great viewing angles in almost every scenario. The screen of the phone gets pretty bright even under the scorching Delhi sun. Keeping the brightness level of the phone to around 60 – 70 per cent in daylight worked pretty well for me while in indoors brightness level at 30 per cent approx seemed adequate.
Under the screen of the phone, there’s a fingerprint sensor that works like a breeze. The face unlock system also unlocks the phone in just a blink of an eye.

The Vivo-Qualcomm partnership for Snapdragon 675 chipset appears to be never-ending. The Vivo’s V15 Pro and V17 Pro and now the V17 are all powered by the same processor. So, if specs matter to you then the Vivo V17 will seem outdated in terms of hardware as it uses a processor that is over a year old. In reality, however, the V17 handles day-to-day tasks very well with no stutters.
I played games like Asphalt 9, Temple Run on the Vivo V17 and both of them worked pretty well for me with no frame drops. At no point did the phone lag. The ultra game mode enhances the overall gaming experience as it blocks calls and notifications during an on-going match. The Vivo V17 also manages to multitask very well, but sometimes too many apps running in the background slowed down the phone slightly. Some of the apps also took some time to open in a few instances.

The phone runs FunTouch 9 OS based on Android 9 Pie, which brings with it lots of bloatware. Software is one area Vivo should make quick changes as FunTouch is too cluttered. There are several third-party apps pre-installed, some can be deleted others can’t. FunTouch also brings along some nifty features like dark-more and always-on display.
Vivo V17 easily lasts more than a day on a single charge. The phone also charges pretty quickly. The V17 comes with 18W fast charger inside the box and it takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge. It is also good to see that Vivo has finally ditched microUSB and made Type C port standard for all its premium phones.
At this price, the Vivo V17 offers great value. The phone sports a clean design and looks unique. It captures great pictures in almost all situations and does a great job with macro and low-light shots. It offers a long-lasting battery life and supports fast charging support inside the box. The only area where I believe Vivo V17 could have been slightly better is hardware.
I wish the phone could have used a Snapdragon 712 or the newer 730 similar to other phones available at this price like the Redmi K20 Pro and Realme XT. As I mentioned, the existing Snapdragon 675 processor does a good job, but a new chipset could have offered a smoother experience and future-proof the device for users.
Should you buy the Vivo V17? Well, although there are some of the most popular phones like Redmi K20 Pro and Realme XT available at this price point I believe the Vivo V17 stands strong against the competition as it offers pretty good value for the money.

The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
Apple has acknowledged the popping sound issues on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The tech giant says the popping sound coming from the speakers of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a software issue, according to a memo obtained by MacRumors. The company says it will roll out a fix through a software update in the near future. The company advises its Authorised Service providers not to repair or replace the affected MacBook Pros due to it.
As reported by MacRumors, users have taken to Apple Support Communities and Reddit to raise their voice about the popping sound issues. Multiple users have reported hearing popping or clicking sounds coming from the speakers when playing audio or video. The popping sound usually occurs after a user has stopped playing a video or audio. One user has suggested that the issue could be related to Final Cut Pro X. It is unclear when Apple plans to fix the issue, but Apple is currently working on it.
Another issue that has surfaced is slow-response time from the 16-inch MacBook Pro wide-colour display. This issue results in a “ghosting” when scrolling text.

Just last month, Apple released a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that succeeded the original 15-inch MacBook Pro, which has now been permanently discontinued. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is pitched as a premium notebook designed to meet the expectations of video editors, musicians, artists, etc. The notebook starts at Rs 190,000 in India, though it will cost more for a fully backed version.
With the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has made a number of changes to make the new computer standout. Perhaps the most visible change comes in the form of a redesigned keyboard that ditches the flat “butterfly” keyboard, as well as a new thermal architecture. Apple has also improved battery life on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.

Vivo V17 with 48MP quad camera, punch-hole display launched in India: Here are details on price, specifications and sale offers. (Image source: Sneha Saha/Indian Express)
Vivo V17, the company’s latest mid-range smartphone with focus on the camera has just been announced for the Indian market. Vivo V17 is a slightly more affordable version of the earlier V17 Pro, which had a similar camera setup at the back. The new phone will go on sale starting December 17, 2019. The company states that V17 has been manufactured at their Greater Noida facility in India.
Vivo V17 comes in only 8GB RAM + 128GB storage option. It will be sold in two colours: Midnight Ocean and Glacier Ice. The price of the Vivo V17 is Rs 22,990. Pre-orders are open from today in offline stores and on vivo’s own estore. The official sale starts December 17, 2019. It will also be sold on Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm mall, Tatacliq and the Bajaj Finserv EMI Store and across all partner retail stores.
Vivo has announced a slew of offers on the purchase of vivo V17, which come with cashback and data benefit. For offline buyers, vivo V17 will come with 5 per cent cashback for those using the HDFC Bank Credit Card for regular transactions or using the credit/debit card for EMI transactions.
There’s also 5 per cent cashback with ICICI Band Credit Card and Debit Card EMI transactions as well as for Axis Bank and for IDFC First Bank & HDBFS paper finance on down payment schemes. All these offers are valid till December 31, 2019. Data benefits for those buying offline will come from Reliance Jio, which will be worth Rs 12,000.
For online customers, there is 5 per cent cashback on prepaid offers, No Cost EMI up to 12 months and the Jio offer of Rs 12,000 data benefits also continues.

Vivo V17 sports a 6.44-inch full HD+ (2400×1080) resolution display, which is an SAMOLED screen with a 20:9 aspect ratio. Vivo V17 has a punch hole display on the front. The company claims the screen can filter out 42 per cent of blue light and comes with anti-flicker technology to protect eyes in the dark. It comes with Schott Xensation UP display protection on top.
Like the vivo V17 Pro, this phone continues to run the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 octa-core processor. We have also seen this processor on older devices like Redmi Note 7 Pro. The phone has a 4500 mAh battery, which comes with the company’s own Dual-Engine Fast Charging technology, though vivo has not specified how quickly it recharges the phone. It comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and has Type-C USB port at the bottom for charging.
The camera on the vivo V17 continues with the quad or four sensor setup at the back. The main camera is 48MP, then there’s an 8MP super-wide angle camera, followed by a 2MP macro camera and 2MP bokeh camera. Other camera features are noise reduction, Super Night for low-light photography, and the phone uses the company’s own portrait algorithm.  The front camera is 32MP.
The device also sports an in-display fingerprint sensor, which features a 3P lens supported by vivo’s intelligent algorithm. On the software front, it also comes with an optimised Game mode, and runs Android Pie 9  based on the company’s own FunTouch OS 9.2 on top. Dimensions of the vivo V17 are 159.01×74.17×8.54mm and it weighs 176 grams.

More than two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed to all Indians. With the Cabinet clearing a data protection bill this past week, the Government of India is making progress on delivering on that promise. Since that judgment, Indians have faced numerous threats to their privacy from the Automated Facial Recognition System, mandatory FastTag car registration, and continuing breaches of Aadhaar demographic data.
Yet, the process to develop a data protection law has been slow and opaque, and the rumours coming out of the government are not encouraging that the bill, which will likely be introduced next week, will deliver the privacy protections that Indians need and deserve. It is vital that the Parliament’s Standing Committee on IT have a chance to review the law and recommend any changes needed to ensure that the privacy of Indian citizens is protected.
Since the Justice BN Srikrishna committee draft was released in 2018, there have been multiple consultations conducted by the IT Ministry, but the public is yet to see a new draft in over 18 months. Thanks to this build up, the changes between the 2018 draft and the upcoming law will be closely studied to measure the extent to which the government has responded to the industry and civil society calls for improving the law.
As details of the final bill begin to leak out, not all of the signs are encouraging. While the public still has yet to see the actual text of the bill, several government sources have been cited detailing new provisions which would undermine, not protect, Indians’ privacy. For example, an official was quoted as saying that social media companies will have to verify the identities of social media users to fight fake news.
They also said that the bill will require the forced transfer of non-personal data to the government. These are serious threats to privacy, which should be carefully reviewed by the Standing Committee on IT of the Parliament.
Explained: The issues, debate around Data Protection Bill
If rumours are to be believed, the bill contains a provision requiring social media companies to provide an option for users to verify their identities using Know Your Customer (KYC) like processes and requires the companies report accounts that choose to opt-out of this verification to the government. People should not be reported to the government for wanting to protect their privacy. There are many reasons why someone would want to use a pseudonym that have nothing to do with fake news — for example, a woman who doesn’t want her stalker to find her online posts or location.
Social media companies can just as easily also exploit the sensitive data harvested from the government IDs submitted for such verification to target and profile users. Both Facebook and Twitter have been heavily criticised for using phone numbers submitted by users for two factor authentication (a security measure) to target ads on its platforms.
Apart from harming user privacy, this will also increase the risk from data breaches and further entrench large players in the social media space who can afford to build and maintain such systems. There is no evidence to suggest that such moves will help in fighting fake news works in any form. The government is also considering tackling the issue of misinformation through amendments to India’s intermediary liability regime, which is a better venue to debate issues of content regulation.
Another concerning provision is the rumoured mandatory sharing of non-personal data for public policy and planning with the government. Allowing the government to force companies to transfer non-personal data raises serious intellectual property concerns, and can still threaten users even if they’re not individually identified. For example, would we want the government knowing which housing colonies in a city have a propensity to buy pro-LGBTQIA+ posters, books about a specific caste, or religious objects? This data may not contain any identifying information about a specific individual but can be used by malicious actors with disastrous consequences.
The law should retain its focus on protecting personal data and not attempt to solve everything from misinformation to data sharing concerns in one law. This will lead to neither of these problems being solved in a sustainable way while actively harming the privacy of Indian users, defeating the entire point of this legislation.
The details on how the law implements these provisions and accounts for other concerns such as its applicability to the government’s use of data will only be clear once the law is made public. We urge the Standing Committee to properly review the bill and the Government to implement recommendations to ensure the final law is an example to the world.

OnePlus TV is finally getting the official Netflix app.
If you own a OnePlus TV and live in India, you can now stream Netflix’s hit shows like Stanger Things and The Crown natively on the device. In a blog post over the official OnePlus Forums, OnePlus TV Software PM, Steven X, confirmed the official Netflix app is now available on a 55-inch QLED screen and a Pro model. While a number of apps were present at the launch, the exclusion of Netflix was seen as a bummer. OnePlus promised that Netflix will be added sometime in October and now it has delivered on that promise.
The latest software update comes with the build number V1.8.0T1911211115 and is rolling out to both OnePlus 55 Q1Pro and OnePlis 55Q1. The update is being released in batches, so it could take some time to show up on your TV. Beyond the Netflix support, the software update also fixes a number of issues, which are listed below:
*Added setting for directly entering recent “Input Source” at startup*Optimized volume adjustment experience to increase or decrease audio volume more comfortable*Pressing volume up and down buttons together to mute the TV*Remote low battery and charging status notification on TV*Optimized PQ video pinkish issue

It is available in two versions – Q1 and Q1 Pro, one with the soundbar and one without. he OnePlus TV offers a 55-inch QLED panel and 4K resolution. The Android TV-powered smart TV brings Dolby Atmos as well as Dolby Vision. During the launch event held in India, OnePlus co-founder and CEO Pete Lau said that the idea behind the OnePlus TV was to bring the smartphone and TV closer.
OnePlus TV competes with Samsung’s high-end QLED TVs and LG’s OLED TVs. At the moment, OnePlus TV is limited to India.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what may be the oddest news this week, Auction house RR Auction has just sold a floppy disk with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' signature for a whopping $84,000. The floppy disk is dated to about 1988 and contains Macintosh System Tools 6.0 software. 
RELATED: STAR WARS FAN-FAVORITE R2-D2 SELLS FOR $2.76 MILLION AT AUCTION
The reason it went for that much, claims the auction house, is that Jobs rarely gave out his signature. "A hugely desirable format for Jobs's seldom-seen autograph—known as a reluctant signer, he often declined to comply with the requests of collectors," reads RR Auction's item description.
The firm also said the disk was in "fine condition, with slight brushing to the ink." "As a piece of Apple's iconic Mac OS software, boasting Jobs's elegantly stylish lowercase signature, this is a museum-quality piece of computing history," further reads the posting.
Initially, the item was estimated to have a value of just $7,500. This is not the first of Jobs' items to sell for an exorbitant amount.
Last August, a "Toy Story" movie poster signed by Jobs went up for auction at of $25,000. In addition, a commemorative plaque and a copy of Mac world both with the late CEO's signature went up for auction at $15,000 and $10,000 respectively.
Finally, last but definitely not least, last year, a job application by the entrepreneur written in 1973 sold for a mind-boggling $174,000. What do you think about these items? Are they a waste of money or valuable mementos meant to be cherished?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rest of the World News
Written By Riya Baibhawi | Mumbai | Updated On: December 09, 2019 17:54 IST
An auction house in US, RR Auction has sold a floppy disk signed by the late Apple co-founder for $84,000. The floppy disk has a copy of Macintosh system tools version 6.0. On the disk’s label is the signature of  Steve jobs with a black felt pen.
RR Auction’s website states that the floppy disk is in fine condition with slight brushing to the ink and part of the item description reads that it is a hugely desirable format for Jobs' seldom-seen autograph. Jobs is remembered as a reluctant signer and he often declined to comply with the requests of collectors making the Apple co-founder’s signature a collector’s item.

According to 2018 Paul Fraser Collectibles Autograph index, it was revealed that Jobs’ signature was more than $50,000 making it one of the most expensive autographs in the world. In September earlier this year, a poster for the original Toy Story signed by jobs sold for over $30,000 by Nate D Sanders Auctions. Jobs was the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, whose first production was Toy story. The movie turned out to be a major hit. Last year, a job application was written by him in 1973 sold for $1,74,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Jaguar F-Type SVR Rendering Imagines A Car We Won’t Get</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this month, the Jaguar F-Type received a noticeable facelift with a smoother design, new front and rear fascias, and other, subtler changes. Along with the new looks, came some trim rejiggering, which gave the F-Type R the SVR’s 575-horsepower (429-kilowatt) V8. Sadly, the top-tier SVR will no longer available, leaving us with this rendering of an updated 2021 F-Type SVR.
The 2021 Jaguar F-Type SVR rendering from Aksyonov Nikita is subtle while capturing all the details we’d expect to see if the top-tier trim ever makes a return. The rendering retains much of the car’s svelte shape and smooth lines. The SVR additions are minor, enhancing the coupe’s look with enough aggressiveness to draw the gaze of a trained eye, but not enough to look outlandish.
The most ostentatious aspect is the wing, but even it feels diminutive. The SVR rendering also features plenty of carbon fiber with accents up front and side skirts. At the rear, there’s a massive carbon fiber rear diffuser with equally enormous quad exhaust tips. If the wing and badging didn’t give away the F-Type’s performance prowess, the exhaust certainly does.
The lack of changes made to the F-Type SVR compared to the standard F-Type is a testament to the F-Type’s well-styled appearance. It’s pleasing to look at, exuding power and performance without the need to scream, “Look at me, please!”
While it is upsetting we won’t get a new SVR – at least anytime soon as the current SVR didn’t debut until three years after the F-Type – we are thankful Jaguar will continue to use the mill in the F-Type R. It’ll help rocket the car to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) in 3.5 seconds while top speed is electronically limited to 186 mph (299 kph). Those are impressive numbers that have us imagining what a new SVR could achieve.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In addition to selling factory-spec vehicles, Long McArthur Ford in Salina, Kansas, also builds its own performance versions of the Blue Oval's products, and the latest one is the F-250 Baja 1000. The edition's name comes from these pickups boasting at least 1,000 pound-feet of torque.
The Baja 1000 starts as a 2019 F-250 in the XL trim and the four-door Crew Cab body. The 6.7-liter turbodiesel V8 gets a cold-air intake and a tune to boost the output. Each truck comes with an individual dyno graph showing how the modifications affect it. Long McArthur guarantees them to make at least 1,000 pound-feet at the crank, but one of them makes an estimated 1,060 lb-ft (1,437 Newton-meters).

It's worth noting that if you want so much torque but buying a vehicle from Kansas isn't an option, then the 2020 model year of the F-250 comes with an updated version of the 6.7-liter turbodiesel that now produces 475 horsepower (354 kilowatts) and 1,050 lb-ft (1,423 Nm) from the factory.
Long McArthur fits an upgraded suspension with a 2.5-inch lift, adjustable traction bar, and Fox 2.0 shocks. The pickup rides on 20-inch wheels and 35-inch BF Goodrich 35-inch all-terrain tires.
The body receives new bumpers with Baja 1000 cut into them, LED fog lights in front, and rear wheel-well liners for extra protection when off-roading. A large graphic splashes across the side of the body. A Rhino Pro spray-in bedliner protects the cargo area. Smaller touches include illuminated trim on the front fenders, black grille, and front window tint.
On the inside, the XL trim generally has cloth upholstery, but Long McArthur Ford refits the cabin with leather-trimmed seats. The company also uses this opportunity to add heating functionality to both rows.
Long McArthur Ford's site currently shows four Baja 1000 trucks for sale, and all of them retail for $69,990. If the red one in this video isn't your style, the showroom also has the pickups in white, black, and dark blue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's Holden Colorado Pickup Spied Testing In Michigan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General Motors has a modest facelift in the works for its midsize Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck in the U.S. market. The truck isn’t just sold in America, however, and that means other regions should get an updated version as well. Ironically, this right-hand-drive Colorado believed to be a Holden model destined for Australia was recently spotted in southeast Michigan, near GM’s Milford Proving Grounds.

It’s the first Holden Colorado sighting we’ve had, and it’s similar to our previous U.S. market encounter in that the changes will be fairly small. The only camouflage on this prototype is at the front, hiding a new front fascia and possible changes to the hood to match the fresh face. The sides and rear – right down to the taillights – look identical to the current model. That’s not to say some updated lights couldn’t be swapped in later, but if that’s the case, they will slot into the Colorado’s current location without modification.
As for what’s beneath the camouflage wrap, a new upper and lower grille with updated fog lamp housings appear to be the primary differences. Headlights are identical to the current model, which is the exact same trend we saw on the U.S.-spec Colorado and GMC Canyon spy shots from earlier in the year. Those trucks will sport larger grilles in the states to closer resemble their full-size counterparts. Unless there’s more grille hiding beneath the camo coverings down low, it appears the bigger-is-better trend won’t make it to Australia.
Powertrain options are expected to remain the same. Interior layout should also be more or less identical, though some added tech could accompany the facelift. We’re expecting to see the tweaked Colorado debut in the states early-to-mid next year as a 2021 model, and our sources say Holden’s version will likely appear around the same time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Volvo S90 sedan, V90 wagon, and V90 Cross Country have styling updates on the way, and these photos catch all three of them conducting cold-weather testing in Sweden. Judging by these shots and earlier pictures, the company doesn't intend to make extensive exterior styling tweaks for this refresh.
Volvo's camouflage puts tiny coverings over sections of the lower bumpers. There's also tape around the front splitter. The pieces have a horizontal layout that might make the vehicles look wider when the camouflage comes off. In addition, the grille spokes have a more concave shape.

Snow covers the back of these vehicles, which conceals some of the changes. If you look very closely, tape is visible on the lower part of the bumper near the exhausts. Volvo also conceals sections of the taillights, which indicates design tweaks for them, too.
So far, the styling revisions for the interior are a mystery. Infotainment system upgrades seem like practically a certainty, though. Look for Volvo also to introduce its latest active safety tech.
Powertrain tweaks are also unknown. An array of mild-hybrid and plug-in powertrains should still be available. Volvo is currently introducing what the company says is its final generation of diesel powerplants, so look for these to be available, too.
Given how small these changes are, we don't expect Volvo to wait very long before debuting the first of the refreshed models. The company might have a staggered unveiling for the sedan and wagon to maintain interest in the improvements among buyers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">VW Caddy Spied Playing In The Snow Again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vans may not garner much interest from hardcore car enthusiasts, but their uncompromised utility should not go overlooked. Volkswagen understands this as it continues to develop a new generation of VW Caddy vans, which are in desperate need of an overhaul. The current model arrived in 2003 with facelifts in 2010 and 2015, but the model still rides on old bones – and that doesn’t jive with the Volkswagen of 2019.  
The new Caddy will ride on VW’s MBQ platform that underpins many of the company’s latest models. While spy photos show the regular-sized Caddy, there should be a longer Maxi version, though Volkswagen is rumored to integrate the Caddy into the VW T7 lineup as the T7 Life Caddy. It’ll join the T7 Multivan while the T7 Family will replace the Sharan. 
While VW has to keep the van’s boxy proportions – it wouldn’t be a van otherwise – the automaker is giving it modern looks. The front end appears a bit longer, and more car-like than before with the classic closed grille. The sliding doors return while the rear gets reworked. The small, square taillights are gone, replaced by units that appear to reach from the beltline to the roof.  
The Caddy’s move to VW’s MBQ platform will also help with smarter packaging, optimizing interior cargo, and passenger space. The platform also allows VW to easily integrate new, alternative powertrains into the vehicle, such as a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, which should help the van meet ever-tightening European emissions standards.  
The Volkswagen Caddy could debut in the second half of next year get pushed to the first quarter of 2021 before going on sale that year. Once the Caddy is out, Volkswagen will then replace the Sharan with the T7 Family the following year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar I-Pace Gets 12 More Miles Of Range From New Software Update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The rumors are true, and Jaguar I-Pace owners can soon visit their local dealer for a free update to boost the electric vehicle's range. The improved software can add up to 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the crossover range.
Jaguar says that the tweaks include optimizations to the battery management, thermal systems, and all-wheel drive torque improvements. The regenerative braking also harvests more energy at low speeds, and the range calculation on the instrument panel is more accurate than before. In an example of race cars improving road-going models, the company says that technical knowhow from the I-Pace eTrophy series is the major contributor to making these upgrades.

"The Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy has generated a huge amount of data for us to analyze and those marginal gains, derived from competition on the track, are now being applied to customers’ cars to further enhance their driving experience," said Stephen Boulter, I-Pace Vehicle Engineering Manager, in the software update's announcement.
The 2020 I-Pace has an EPA-estimated range of 234 miles (377 kilometers) before this update. Jag notes that is upgrade doesn't change that figure. However, the company's testing shows the tweaked software provides an eight percent boost in range "dependent on usage."
As an extra bonus, this software upgrade also enhances the I-Pace's ability to get over-the-air updates in the future by making more of the vehicle's electronic modules available for improvements.
Jaguar seems serious about eventually adding a high-performance version of the I-Pace to the lineup, and it would likely take significant inspiration from the eTrophy racer. Expect the model to have a boost in output and possibly a larger battery to keep the range up. Unfortunately, the vehicle could still be years away because the SVO division is working on other projects.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mercedes EQA Spied With Production Body And Lights</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just a few hours ago, we shared the first spy photos with an almost uncamouflaged prototype of the new Mercedes-Benz GLA. Now, we can take a closer look at its all-electric version, tentatively called the EQA, which has been spotted testing on public roads in Scandinavia.
The EV high-riding model will ride on the MFA II platform, which will be shared with the combustion-powered GLA. This easily explains the similarities in the overall shape between the two cars. From the short overhangs at the back and up front to the gently sloping roofline at the back, everything seems to be almost identical. Still, unique trim and lighting ornaments should be installed on the EV.

It’s a completely different story underneath the skin, however. Whereas the GLA is expected to launch with a range of turbocharged combustion engines, the EQA will use a purely electric powertrain with an estimated maximum range at a single charge of 298 miles (480 kilometers). Not much else is known at the moment but expect to see several different variants depending on the power output, range, and price. An AWD model could also happen.
Mercedes has plans to launch no fewer than 10 all-electric models on the market by 2025, and the EQ A is one of the many new EVs we should see from the Stuttgart-based company in the next 12 to 24 months. These also include the EQB and EQS models, with the latter expected to take the crown as the brand’s EV flagship offering.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Land Rover Defender By Overfinch Is A Green Gem With Massive Engine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's a new generation of the Land Rover Defender getting headlines, but Overfinch continues to give attention to the original. The tuner's latest project is a one-off soft top pickup in a vivid shade of emerald green and a big engine under the hood.
Power receives a major upgrade from a General-Motors-sourced 6.2-liter V8. Overfinch doesn't outline the output, but these engines are famous for their easy tunability. The company also adds a stainless steel exhaust and carbon fiber engine cover. The output runs through an automatic gearbox and four-wheel-drive system.
While the vehicle is still capable of going off-road, Overfinch put a greater emphasis on luxury for this build. Using Defender 90 as the starting point, the company removed the second row's bench seat and replaced it with a teak cargo bed. For keeping things secure, there's a lockable storage box. A full-size spare tire has a special spot back there, too.
The occupants in front sit in Recaro sport seats that have emerald green and tan leather upholstery. The hides also cover the dashboard and steering wheel. The door handles, gearshift, handbrake, pedals, and instrument dials are chrome with a knurled finish.
Overfinch makes a few exterior tweaks, including fitting a custom hood with a sculpted power bulge. The company also fits a set of 18-inch wheels with green details that match the body's color. A removable soft top panel clips onto the roll bars to offer a little overhead protection.
A client commissioned Overfinch to build this vehicle. There's no info on its price, but with enough money, the company would surely create another if a buyer comes along.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat has a new feature that will let you take a selfie and use the resulting image to put your face into videos and gifs -- deepfake style. The new feature is called Snapchat Cameos, and it's viewed as an alternative to Bitmoji for conveying feelings in a Snapchat message.
Snapchat has stated that Cameo is currently a limited availability product that is in testing. For now, Cameos is said to be available in some limited international markets; however, a date for international rollout has been announced. The global launch of Cameos will happen on December 18 for iOS and Android.
Using Cameos sounds simple enough, requiring users to take a selfie to show the app what you look like. Users can then choose male or female body types. Once those steps are done, Cameo is in the Bitmoji button on the Snapchat messaging keyboard.
Snapchat has 150 short looping video clips (which also feature sounds) that users can place their face into. The Cameo app will stretch and move the face cribbed from the selfie you used in the setup portion to fit the user's face onto the video and make it move. A multi-friend Cameo feature is offered that will allow users to have their face in videos with friends.
Multiple categories will be offered that can be searched for videos to suit what message the user wants to convey. In addition, the selfie used to generate the videos can be changed whenever you want, and cameos can be saved to the camera roll for sharing elsewhere. The last time we talked about Snapchat was when it rolled out the third-generation of its Spectacles last summer that offer a pair of integrated HD cameras.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A more realistic Bitmoji? Snapchat is rolling out a tool called Cameo that uses deepfake technology</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SnapChat is adding a feature that basically allows you to deepfake yourself into a video or GIF for fun.
The feature was first spotted by Snapchat users in France who received a test version of the tool over the weekend. The latest addition to the app is called Cameo, Snapchat said in a press release Monday.
"With Cameos, you become the star of short, looping videos that you can customize with your own face," Snapchat said. "They're great for striking up new conversations or making responses to your friends personal, dynamic and fun."
Based on screen captures posted by people on Twitter, Cameo uses your selfie to plaster your face on a digitized body. The feature has a similar look and application to Bitmoji, except more realistic. It's rolling out globally on Dec.18 with over 150 variations to choose from.
Cameo will be embedded in the Chat sticker bar once the new feature is live in the U.S. You get to choose the body you'd like for your face to appear on, and Snapchat will use AI to manipulate your face into displaying different emotions and expressions.
If your friends set up Cameo, you'll see options that feature the two of you together. And, many can include your own text.
Deepfake technology would be a relatively new frontier for the app, though it would further differentiate Snapchat from its rivals Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. The technology, which has been used to transpose celebrities into pornographic videos, has come under criticism because it could be used to maliciously produce fake political videos.
Still, Snapchat has been hard at work developing new filters and add-ons to keep the platform interesting for teens and young adults who are constantly on the hunt for new, creative ways to interact with peers.
In November, Snapchat picked up where the wildly popular Face App left off by rolling out a tool that tries to show you what you look like at every phase of life. It's called Time Machine, and it includes a slider you can drag across your screen to watch the years add up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to clear your Google search history on your Android phone or tablet, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What you search for on your Android phone or tablet is your own private business, but if someone were to go through your Google search history on your device, that private stuff could become all too public. That’s the main reason you should regularly clear your Google search history on your Android, but it’s not the only reason.
Past Google searches can impact the results you get in future searches, which means that the results Google gives you could be influenced by keywords you searched in the past. For example, say you had an assignment about the Civil War, but now that it’s submitted your interest in the 1860s has faded – until you clear your search history, those dozens of Civil War-centric search queries will still influence your Google results here in the 21st century.
Clearing search history on an Android device is a quick and easy process, so don’t skip it.
1. Launch the Google Chrome app and check to make sure you are logged into your account.
2. Tap the three little dots at the top-right corner of the screen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to clear your Google search history on your Android phone or tablet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What you search for on your Android phone or tablet is your own private business, but if someone were to go through your Google search history on your device, that private stuff could become all too public. That’s the main reason you should regularly clear your Google search history on your Android, but it’s not the only reason.
Past Google searches can impact the results you get in future searches, which means that the results Google gives you could be influenced by keywords you searched in the past. For example, say you had an assignment about the Civil War, but now that it’s submitted your interest in the 1860s has faded – until you clear your search history, those dozens of Civil War-centric search queries will still influence your Google results here in the 21st century.
Clearing search history on an Android device is a quick and easy process, so don’t skip it.
1. Launch the Google Chrome app and check to make sure you are logged into your account.
2. Tap the three little dots at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Tap on “History” in the drop-down menu.
4. Tap “CLEAR BROWSING DATA” on the next screen.
5. Tap the words “Last hour” to select the time and date range of search data you want to erase, then tap “CLEAR DATA.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to make Instagram highlight covers for the Stories Highlights on your profile page, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s possible to post highlights of your Instagram Stories to preserve a selection of your stories, which usually disappear after 24 hours.
After you post Instagram Stories, they will be saved in a private Stories Archive in your account. You can these choose if you want to add any to your highlights, which will appear publicly on your profile page.
Each highlight has a cover photo, and the default option is the first photo or video within that highlight. But it’s easy to change the highlight cover to another image so it looks exactly the way you want on your profile.
Here’s how to do it.
1. Launch the Instagram app on your iPhone or Android phone.
2. Tap the profile icon on the far right of the bottom menu.
3. Find your highlights under your profile bio and select the one you want to edit the cover of.
4. In the bottom right-hand corner, tap the three horizontal dots above the word “More” – this will access the highlights menu.
5. Select Edit Highlight from the pop-up menu.
6. Under Edit Highlight, tap Edit Cover.
7. Toggle through your highlights to find the photo you want to use as the cover. If the photo you want to use as the highlight’s cover is not already in your highlights, you must add it.
8. Resize it to your liking.
9. Tap Done in the upper right-hand corner, and once more to save your changes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to share a YouTube channel on desktop or mobile, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Your YouTube channel is your home base on YouTube. It’s where people can find all the videos you’ve posted, see what other channels you follow, check out your playlists, and much more.
So if you want to share all your great YouTubecontent – or even someone else’s channel – just share your YouTube channel.
Here are two easy ways to share a YouTube channel.
1. Log into your account, then click your picture in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Click “Your channel” from the drop-down menu.
3. Now simply copy the URL from your browser’s URL field (at the top of the window, below your tabs) and paste it into an email, Facebook message, or whatever other medium you prefer.
Send that off, and now your YouTube channel has been shared. The same process applies for any other YouTube channel page.
1. Launch the YouTube app, and then tap your image in the top-right.
2. Tap “Your channel” from the menu that opens.
3. Now tap the three vertical dots in the top-right.
4. Finally, tap “Share,” and then choose the method by which you want to share the channel. Even here, you can still tap “Copy link” if you want to copy and paste the URL like you would on a computer.
Again, the same process applies for any YouTube channel.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nobody wants their phone rattling around their car while they drive, getting dirty, wet, or damaged — you've got to keep that thing in place. If you're looking for a solution and nothing's sticking, you might be drawn to the iOttie iTap magnetic mount, currently on sale at Amazon for $11 ($6 off).
The vent mount uses a one-touch, spring-loaded clip to latch onto and release from your vent, allowing for quick installation and removal. The kit includes metal plates which attach to your phone or case with adhesive. The plates connect your phone to the mount, which uses rare earth magnets to provide six pounds of pull force, keeping your device firmly in place.
While the vent mount is discounted to $11 ($6 off), iOttie also offers a CD slot variant, as well as one which sticks directly to your dashboard. The CD slot mount is on sale for $14 ($7 off) and the dashboard mount is currently $13 ($7 off). You can pick up your preferred style (or all three, we don't judge here) at Amazon today.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In case you missed the recently concluded Black Friday and Cyber Monday extravaganza, this is your chance to grab a pretty sweet deal on Google’s latest flagship pair. Both the Pixel 4 and the 4 XL are down by $100 and $150, respectively, across major online stores. And if that wasn’t enough, Amazon is throwing in a free Google Wifi on top of these discounts.
While the Black Friday deals on the two Pixels do outshine the current discounts, the Amazon bundle makes them a decent deal, considering that a single unit of this previous-gen smart router retails at $99.
Despite being a few years old, Google Wifi continues to play nice with its follow-up — Nest Wifi. You can either create a mesh system with a combination of the two models or upgrade your existing Google Wifi network by adding the Nest Wifi router as the central unit. We also have a handy guide to help you add your Google Wifi routers to the Google Home app and enable WPA3 security.
You can grab your Pixel 4 or 4 XL through these links:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Update 1: 2019/12/09 2:53pm UTCThree weeks later
Cloud gaming isn't a new idea. Companies like OnLive (RIP) have been trying to make it work for the better part of a decade. Google's effectively limitless resources and software wizardry make it an ideal fit to work the kinks out of such a complicated problem, and with Stadia, it seems it may have done just that. In my time with the platform, streaming performance has been wildly impressive — but lackluster day-one game selection and plenty of half-baked features make for a rocky start for the fledgling gaming platform.
Stadia Pro bundles — both the Founders Edition and the Premiere Edition — come with a Chromecast Ultra (complete with Ethernet adapter), a Stadia controller, a USB-C charger, and a setup guide. You'll need that Chromecast to play on your TV, too, even if you've already got another Chromecast or an Android TV box plugged in — other Chromecast Ultras will get a software update sometime in the future to enable Stadia compatibility, but Google hasn't said when.
If you've played a video game in the past two decades, odds are good your fingers will feel right at home on the Stadia controller. It's got the standard layout: four face buttons arranged in a diamond, two analog sticks, a directional pad, and four shoulder buttons. There's also Google's version of start and select — "menu" and "options" — plus a not-yet-functional Google Assistant key and a Nintendo Switch-style capture button that'll grab a screenshot with a tap or a 30-second clip with a long press. Between the joysticks is a backlit button that starts Stadia up and opens the system menu once it's running.
Google talks a big game about the controller's design; the company says it studied chef's knives to craft the ideal grip. The result of all that attention to detail is a controller that feels... fine. It's plenty comfortable to hold, but the d-pad and bumpers depress with an unsatisfying plasticky click. It's not something you notice when you're engrossed in a game, but it doesn't do the pad's price tag justice — on its own, the thing costs 70 bucks.
Part of the reason for that steep asking price is Wi-Fi connectivity. The Stadia controller can connect directly to the internet, sending your inputs straight to Google's servers and eliminating the small amount of extra latency a Bluetooth connection to a local device would add in the middle. It's hard to say how much good that actually does, but it'll be nice not to have to juggle Bluetooth connections to various devices once wireless play is available on phones and in Chrome (it's only supported on the included Chromecast Ultra at launch).
It's a very handsome piece of hardware, in a traditionally Google way. Design director Isabelle Olsson has described its appearance as "human" and "optimistic" — pretty high-concept language to talk about a gamepad, but not inaccurate. The Stadia controller fits right in with Google's other friendly-looking recent hardware like the Pixel 4 and Nest Wifi. The navy and orange number included in the Founders Edition bundle is definitely pleasant (bonus points for Detroit Tigers fans), but the funky green Wasabi colorway is my favorite by a wide margin.
The Stadia interface is uniform across devices; what you see on your TV is like what you'll see in Chrome and on your phone. At launch, it's pretty barebones. From the bundled Chromecast Ultra or at stadia.google.com in Chrome, you can launch games and manage your friends list, and not much else. The Android app also lets you shop for games and DLC and view captured screenshots and clips (although you can't share them yet — that's another feature that's coming later). It's nice that the experience is at least visually consistent between all your screens, but it's a little annoying that some functionality is limited to the mobile app. Why can't I buy a game from my TV?
The Stadia app's home screen.
Purchases are tied to your Google account, and you earn Play Points for money spent on Stadia. You can use Play Store credit toward games and add-on content, too. Finally, something to spend that Google Opinion Rewards survey money on.
When launching a game from the Android app, you're given the option to start it either right there on your compatible phone — at launch, just Pixel phones from 2018 or later — or the Chromecast Ultra included in Stadia bundles. If you want to play on your phone or computer, you'll have to either connect the Stadia controller by USB or use your mouse and keyboard or other third-party peripheral. Wireless connectivity is coming later.
The Stadia store.
On day one, you'll have your choice of 22 games, up from an expected 12:
They're all good, but there's a conspicuous lack of brand-new bangers on the list; there's no Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or Jedi: Fallen Order to be found. Softball evergreen titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are also absent. There'll be more high-profile titles by the end of the year: Borderlands 3 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint are landing before 2020, among others. More big gets including Doom: Eternal and Cyberpunk 2077 are coming next year, too.
Compared to the previously announced list of a dozen launch titles, the updated crop is considerably more robust. Still, with no real system-sellers and only one exclusive in Tequila Works' horror adventure indie Gylt, it's hard to get too excited about this particular handful of titles, especially if you've already got another current-generation game machine around (then again, if you already have one of those, you're probably not interested in Stadia in the first place).
Red Dead Redemption 2, Gylt, and Destiny 2. Screens captured on Stadia.
It's comforting, then, that Stadia runs all its launch titles immaculately. On my pedestrian connection of about 100 megabits down and 10 up with something like 20 milliseconds of latency — which Stadia's built-in connection checker rates as "excellent" — I haven't experienced a single connection hiccup. Red Dead Redemption 2 runs smoothly at 1440p and 30 frames per second. I can successfully get through Mortal Kombat 11's arcade mode on medium difficulty, which is about as well as I'd expect to perform on any platform. I regularly nailed alien baddies in the dome in Destiny 2, even during Google's prescribed reviewer multiplayer times. It's crazy good.
Mortal Kombat 11 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Screens captured on Stadia.
But there's no way to tell how the system will hold up with thousands of active players, and there are about a million factors that can influence the streaming experience. Our own Matt Sholtz has a better connection than I do on paper, but Nvidia's cloud gaming service GeForce Now — which has been great for me — runs so poorly for him as to be unplayable, even on Ethernet. Will Stadia struggle on his network, too? You also might be more sensitive to input lag than I am, and missing a frame or two may completely ruin your fun. It's all very subjective.
Google Stadia7/10
You should probably wait, unless you're really into the launch titles and have no other way to play them. As impressive as the core Stadia experience has been for me, it's hard to get around the bland day-one game selection. There's currently a boatload of missing features, too: Buddy Passes that let you gift a friend three months of Stadia Pro won't be available on launch day, achievements aren't ready yet, and you can currently only use the Chromecast Ultra that comes in Stadia bundles to play on your TV, among other shortcomings. And Google's nasty habit of killing its products looms large over this one; it sure seems like the company is serious, but there's no way to know for sure where Stadia will be in five years — or if it'll be anywhere at all. I asked what happens to game purchases should Stadia fold, and was told only that Google is "committed to making Stadia a success."
If Google's commitment is genuine and Stadia holds up under normal stress as well as it has during the review period, though, it could very well have a major impact on the greater gaming landscape. If you don't already have a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you don't mind paying for the experience of games rather than ownership, and you've got a solid internet connection, Stadia would probably fit very neatly into your life. You just might want to give it a few months to see how things shake out.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google's Assistant newest iteration, which launched with the Pixel 4, has a few tricks up its sleeve, but accessing it has been restricted by some draconian requirements. You need to have a Pixel 4 with gesture navigation, no G Suite account on the same user profile, and everything has to be set to US English. That last limitation will soon be lifted with five new English variants joining in.
As was previously expected, Google is starting to relax the language requirement around the new Assistant. The company says that the digital helper will "soon" be available on the Pixel 4 in these five English variants: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and UK. These come in addition to US English.
Keep in mind that you don't need to live in one of these countries to activate the new Assistant; you just need your phone and Assistant language to be set to a supported language.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stadia's store will support trials and demos, gifting, wishlists, pre-orders, and tons of other lists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stadia launched in what what most would consider a very unfinished state, missing many plenty of the announced features like family sharing and broadcasting, or with very rushed and incomplete features like screenshots or a game store. Shopping for games initially required the smartphone app, but the store launched on the web last week, opening the door to a more convenient shopping experience. It also reveals a bit more about some of the marketing and categorization we'll see as the Stadia catalog fills out.
The roll call of titles is currently at 23 games (not counting multiple editions), so there's not much need for a list that splits them, but that's obviously not going to remain true for long. Through some experimentation on the store URLs, more than 100 pages were discovered that will be used to present games based on popularity, features, genre, publisher, and deals. There are also a few lists that confirm some notable upcoming features, like wishlists, trials and demos, and pre-orders.
For a quick refresher, four lists can be found in the web interface now, including a full list, a couple for recommendations, and one that lists the games available with Stadia Pro.
While those pages currently show a number of games, all of the other pages are currently empty. However, the names aren't hard to decipher, and most of them can be broken up into some natural categories. There are plenty of standard groups, like general recommendations, popular titles, top sellers, and those that highlight certain features (e.g. best 4K). You'll also find pages for games from major publishers like 2K, Bethesda, and Square Enix. And to round it out, there's a large list of 56 genres with everything from action and adventure to visual novels and trivia.
Recommendations
Popularity
Shopping
Teasers
Feature Highlights
Miscellaneous
Publishers
Genres
Special
The big notable lists in this group are the ones that reference upcoming features, like a list of the Most gifted games, confirming that gifting will be supported. And I think we all expected Stadia to offer Demos and Trials for some games, but now it's safe to assume those will begin appearing eventually. Pre-orders were also a given, and like most other services, there is a special Your wishlist page where you can find games you've earmarked to pick up.
Stadia will highlight games that are Popular on YouTube, and there will be a section dedicated to Stadia exclusives. Titles with major updates and new content will be shown in Recently Updated, New add-ons, and Expansions. It looks like there will also be a space oriented toward groups of games that belong together as a Collection or Compilation.
And finally, a look through the genres is somewhat enlightening. Some of the obvious groupings include Adventure, Platformer, and Sports; and since there was inexplicably some doubt about this, there are even multiple categories dedicated to getting lots of people together: MMO games, MMORPGs, and MOBA games. You'll also find some entries that don't fall into the classic categories but have earned groups of dedicated fans like Dating simulations and Visual novel. There's a lot of overlap in the list, but with 56 genre pages ready to go, Stadia clearly expects to cover most interests.
Naturally, this list is subject to change and there's plenty of room for it to grow as new requirements come up. There will be more entries as major publishers sign on, new game categories catch on, and somebody in marketing concocts a new way to pitch games — let's say, seasonal and holiday-themes...
In the meantime, let's get back to looking forward to new games and features. I'm still waiting to see how Stadia tackles livestreaming to an audience.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When you think Android TV Box, you might think Nvidia Shield TV right away, but the company best known for its graphics cards isn't the only one offering a capable big screen experience for Android. Xiaomi's Mi Box S is a neat little device outputting 4K HDR to your TV, and it's on sale at Walmart, going for only $30. That's the lowest we've ever seen and $5 less than the recent offer of $35.
Despite the bargain price, the box still checks all of the most important ... boxes. In addition to the obligatory HDMI 2.0a out, it comes with an AUX connector and a full-size USB 2.0 port so you can use external hard drives. It supports Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz and 5GHz and Bluetooth 4.1, the latter of which its remote uses to connect to the device. While the aging Android 8.1 the Mi Box S runs may seem a tad outdated, it should still outperform most of the "smart" software on cheaper TVs, and it gives you easy access to Google Assistant and Chromecast. The box is also slated to get Android 9, which is being tested as part of a beta program right now.
Head to Walmart to buy the device. If your TV is older, you might be surprised how much more life you'll be able to eke out of it thanks to the Mi Box S.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus TV gets Netflix app and new improved remote controller</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OnePlus marked its entry into the TV market this September with a pair of TV sets, one of which had a fancy motorized soundbar retracting from its bottom. Both models have so far remained exclusive to India, where they support a bunch of local streaming services, aside from Prime Video, though the Netflix app was a notable omission. That's changed now as OnePlus is bringing the app to its TV range via a system update, while newer units will ship with Netflix preinstalled. The company has also introduced a redesigned remote controller with a dedicated button for the new app.
Besides adding Netflix, the new update (v1.8.0T1911211115) for the OnePlus TV Q1 and the Q1 Pro fixes a few issues that have been plaguing existing units. OnePlus has fixed the pinkish hues and has included an option to auto-select the input source on startup. When the bundled rechargeable remote controller needs some juice, it’ll now push a notification to the screen, while OnePlus has also tried to compensate for its lack of a mute button with a silly workaround: Press both volume keys together. You can avoid this fuss with an optional upgrade to the improved controller, available without any cost to existing users.
Change log:
The original remote controller was a sleek metal slab (think: OnePlus 3/3T), but with awkwardly placed volume keys. A new controller was needed to include a dedicated Netflix button (which should be configurable using these steps), and OnePlus took this opportunity to fix its striking but flawed remote unit. The redesigned one now has a thicker plastic body, runs on a AAA battery, and has addressed the button issues. Current OnePlus TV users who got the bundled metal remote can claim their free upgrade using an invitation code that you can obtain by following a few steps mentioned on the product page. You can alternatively use the companion remote app that comes handy for typing.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you're looking for a reliable pair of workout buds, you should consider the Jabra Elite Active 65t. They initially cost $190 when they came out, but you can snatch them for $130, thanks to this markdown.
The buds are designed with fitness in mind, as they come with a built-in accelerometer for step tracking and feature IP56 water and sweat resistance. They offer about five hours of playback time, which can then be extended to ten hours thanks to the charging case. Unfortunately, the latter is filled up using a Micro-USB port, which isn't necessarily convenient if your phone charges with a more modern USB-C cable.
If you want to grab a pair, use the links below to purchase your buds from your favorite retailers.
Buy: Amazon, Best Buy

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to noise-canceling headphones, Bose is probably one of the most reliable brands on the market. Its QC 35 have long been one of the leaders on the market, and after refreshing them back in 2017, the company released an overhauled product on the market, the 700 headphones. They were initially priced at $400, but you can now get them for $50 less.
The 700 headphones offer 11 levels of noise cancellation, which you can adjust based on your preferences. Thanks to their four microphones, they're able to isolate your voice from surrounding noises. In terms of battery life, you'll get about 20 hours on a single charge, which is more than enough to go through long flights. When the time comes to fill them up, you'll be able to use a USB-C charger, which is convenient if your phone uses the same connectivity. Lastly, just like the QC35 II, they come with built-in digital assistants, as both Assistant and Alexa are there to help you out when you need a hand.
The price drop seems to be across most retailers; just pick your favorite one below to make your purchase.
Buy: Amazon, Adorama,  Best Buy, B&H, Target, Walmart

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Update 1: 2019/12/09 12:31pm UTCGoogle may actually keep its promise this time. Some users have started seeing the new Notes & Lists menu under Assistant settings > Services. It's a server-side rollout, though, so
Google Assistant's ability to manage lists has been... less than ideal. When Assistant first went live in 2016, it could add items to a shopping list, which then appeared in Google Keep. That was a nice start, but then Google decided to move the shopping list to the Home app with integration for Google Express (now Google Shopping). At long last, Assistant is finally receiving first-class support for notes and lists... maybe. Fingers crossed.
Google first announced in mid-2018 that integration with Google Keep, Any.do, and other services was in the works for Assistant. Then a Google employee reaffirmed in October 2018 that the feature was still in development, and a blog post from the following month just said "soon." Google again said to-dos and list management was coming in a January blog post, but that section was later deleted. That makes this the fifth time Google has announced this functionality.
Google didn't limit the new list/note management feature to its own Keep app, either — it also works with Any.do, AnyList, and Bring. Just like with music and video services, you can add accounts and choose your default from the Google Assistant settings (Assistant settings > Services > Notes & Lists). Interestingly, support for Todoist was mentioned in previous announcements, but is now missing.
Here's hoping more services are added in the future, like Evernote and OneNote. This functionality should start rolling out today, so it might be a little while before you see it on your own devices.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re already a PlayStation owner, considering buying one for yourself or a family member, one accessory you should consider this Christmas is a PlayStation Plus subscription.
The regular price for an annual PS Plus membership in most gaming shops or online through the PlayStation store is £49.99 - but we’ve found a fantastic website that sells them much cheaper.
Don’t forget, there’s a seven-day free trial available for anyone looking to give the PS Plus membership a try - just access it through the console menu and follow the onscreen instructions.
You'll need a PlayStation Plus membership to play PS4 games online.
On the plus side, membership also gives you access to the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection which includes two free games each month that are yours to keep while you're a subscriber.
PlayStation Plus memberships also get you exclusive discounts in sales across the PlayStation Network and lets you upload game saves to the cloud, which is brilliant for backing up your progress in case your console's hard drive fails.
If you play games online then PlayStation Plus membership is absolutely worth purchasing, if not essential to your PlayStation experience.
PS Plus membership also has benefits for those who never play online.
A constant roster of new titles to download and play for free will save you far more than the membership costs each month.
The PS Plus membership is available for a variety of lengths, ranging from 30 days to 12 months.
PlayStation Plus is also available to buy on Amazon, but the prices are on par with the official PlayStation Store - £49.99 for an annual subscription.
CDKeys is one of the cheapest prices to buy a 12-month Xbox Live Gold membership.
If you'd prefer to go down the official route, you can buy directly from the Microsoft's website for £49.99.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New steps against scammers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some of Canada's telephone providers are being called on by the country's telecom regulator to add to their arsenals in the battle against phone scammers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced Monday that it expects companies that provide Internet-based phone services to adopt new technology by next fall aimed at reducing the number of fake calls received by unsuspecting consumers.
To better protect Canadians from so-called "spoof" calls, telecom companies should be able to implement systems by Sept. 30, 2020 that will give many consumers the ability to verify whether calls they receive are from legitimate people, businesses or government agencies, the CRTC said.
The regulator wants service providers to adopt a new framework, known by the acronym STIR/SHAKEN and already adopted in parts of the United States, that will allow Canadians with Internet Protocol or VOIP-based phones, or mobile phones, to see whether calls they receive can be trusted.
"Nuisance calls are a major irritant for many Canadians," CRTC chairman Ian Scott said in a statement.
"The new STIR/SHAKEN framework will enable Canadians to know, before they answer the phone, whether a call is legitimate or whether it should be treated with suspicion."
It is not clear, however, how the calls will be verified.
That will depend on how service providers implement the technology, said the regulator, calling the required technical changes "complicated."
The regulator says that roughly 40 per cent of the 80,000 to 90,000 complaints it receives annually about unwanted phone calls revolve around caller-ID spoofing.
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has estimated Canadians have lost nearly $17 million since 2014 to scam artists who use computer programs to spoof legitimate telephone numbers, including numbers used by the Canada Revenue Agency, Service Canada and even local police.
To convince their intended victims to take their scams seriously, fraudsters use programs to change the number they're calling from to one that the receiver would trust, such as a friend or legitimate government agency. In some of the more elaborate scams, fraud artists will call the victim from a second number that also appears on a caller ID display as coming from a legitimate source.
Caller ID technology used in today's phone systems was developed with little consideration that it could be used nefariously and hasn't changed much, while the technology to exploit it has exploded.
STIR/SHAKEN ("Secure Telephony Information Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs") will enable VOIP service providers to verify whether a caller's identity can be trusted.
What that will look like on your call display hasn't been determined, the CRTC said Monday.
It could appear as a check mark or some other indicator that suggests it's OK to answer a call, officials said. Much depends on how the phone service providers implement the framework.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phone service providers expected to adopt new caller ID verification program</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA - Some of Canada's telephone providers are being called on by the country's telecom regulator to add to their arsenals in the battle against phone scammers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced Monday that it expects companies that provide Internet-based phone services to adopt new technology by next fall aimed at reducing the number of fake calls received by unsuspecting consumers.
To better protect Canadians from so-called “spoof” calls, telecom companies should be able to implement systems by Sept. 30, 2020 that will give many consumers the ability to verify whether calls they receive are from legitimate people, businesses or government agencies, the CRTC said.
The regulator wants service providers to adopt a new framework, known by the acronym STIR/SHAKEN and already adopted in parts of the United States, that will allow Canadians with Internet Protocol or VOIP-based phones, or mobile phones, to see whether calls they receive can be trusted.
“Nuisance calls are a major irritant for many Canadians,” CRTC chairman Ian Scott said in a statement.
“The new STIR/SHAKEN framework will enable Canadians to know, before they answer the phone, whether a call is legitimate or whether it should be treated with suspicion.”
It is not clear, however, how the calls will be verified.
That will depend on how service providers implement the technology, said the regulator, calling the required technical changes “complicated.”
The regulator says that roughly 40 per cent of the 80,000 to 90,000 complaints it receives annually about unwanted phone calls revolve around caller-ID spoofing.
The calls are not just a nuisance.
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has estimated Canadians have lost nearly $17 million since 2014 to scam artists who use computer programs to spoof legitimate telephone numbers, including numbers used by the Canada Revenue Agency, Service Canada and even local police.
To convince their intended victims to take their scams seriously, fraudsters use programs to change the number they're calling from to one that the receiver would trust, such as a friend or legitimate government agency. In some of the more elaborate scams, fraud artists will call the victim from a second number that also appears on a caller ID display as coming from a legitimate source.
Caller ID technology used in today's phone systems was developed with little consideration that it could be used nefariously and hasn't changed much, while the technology to exploit it has exploded.
STIR/SHAKEN (“Secure Telephony Information Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs”) will enable VOIP service providers to verify whether a caller's identity can be trusted.
What that will look like on your call display hasn't been determined, the CRTC said Monday.
It could appear as a check mark or some other indicator that suggests it's OK to answer a call, officials said. Much depends on how the phone service providers implement the framework.
The framework does not work on landline phones offered by so-called legacy service providers.
But the CRTC said major telecom companies are also expected to meet a Dec. 19 deadline to implement technology that could eliminate calls from scammers by blocking calls with misformed ID numbers such as those starting with a zero or appearing to originate overseas. Telecom service providers have also been exploring ways to trace nuisance calls back to their points of origin so they can be blocked or investigated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">25 innovative and cool iPhone accessory gifts for Apple lovers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the great things about the iPhone is that, since it’s been a staple smartphone for so long, there is a veritable ton of iPhone accessories for all sorts of budgets. Naturally, you have your high-end wireless headphones, speakers and even charging cases, but there are also straight cases, long-lasting Lightning cables and phone grips for as low as $10.
As Insider Picks’ badge-wearing tech nerds and iPhone stans, we’ve tried out tons of accessories over the years, and gifted many of these accessories to friends and family as well – all of which have been received with glee and inevitable phone calls asking for tech support.
The majority of these gifts are available with “free” two-day shipping if you subscribe to Amazon Prime, so they’ll arrive ready to wrap for Christmas if you act quickly.
It seems like iPhones get bigger every year, so why not buy a nice sturdy PopSocket grip and save your loved one the pinky strain? These handy grips stick on the back of most iPhone cases with ease and pop out twice to provide excellent grip. Your giftee can even use them to prop up their phone so it stands alone as they watch videos.
PopSocket grips come in more patterns, colors, and styles than I can count, so you’ll be sure to find one that matches the personality of your loved one. I personally love my PopSocket grip so much that I can’t imagine life without it.
There are two things wrong with the lightning cable Apple includes in the box with each new iPhone: The cable is too short and it’s too weak. Native Union’s Night Cable solves both those problems with a 10-foot-long durable cable that can easily reach to charge your phone.
It also has a handy knotted weight on it that you can move up and down the cable to ensure that your iPhone stays on the table while it charges without falling or moving. It’s our favorite long iPhone cable.
There’s nothing better than a leather iPhone case and Nomad makes our favorite ones. Not only are they durable and protective, but the cases are also made with soft Horween leather that ages beautifully. We can’t recommend these cases enough.
If your giftee loves taking high-quality photos, they’ll love having the Lume Cube Air in their mobile photography kit. The little light helps illuminate the subject of a photo when the lighting is less than ideal.
Marshall is known for its classic rock-n-roll aesthetic, and its Kilburn II Bluetooth Speaker is an icon in its own right. This speaker has the classic Marshall look and appears to be an amp at first glance. It’s actually a powerful Bluetooth speaker with a massive battery inside that can last through about 20 hours of playback. I use this speaker at home often, and I love it – your iPhone-addicted giftee will, too.
If the person you’re shopping for has an iPhone 8 or newer, you should get them a wireless charger. This one from Courant is perfect. It’s both beautiful and practical, as it charges two devices wirelessly at the same time at up to 10 watts. It’s made of Italian leather and has an attractive braided nylon cable. Thanks to its five charging coils, there are no dead spots, either.
Trust me, you don’t even want to know how dirty your loved one’s iPhone is, but with a WHOOSH! cleaning kit, their iPhone can be germ-free in seconds. This kit comes with an antimicrobial microfiber cloth and a 3.4-ounce disinfecting spray that’s safe for electronics. I use WHOOSH! all the time to keep my phone germ-free during cold and flu season.
Bang & Olufsen makes gorgeous wireless headphones that look as great as they sound. They are expensive, but the sound quality, classy design, and stable Bluetooth connectivity make them a great choice – especially for people who have an iPhone 7 or newer without the headphone jack.
There is no better smartwatch than the Apple Watch Series 5. Just about every iPhone owner will love to have one, so this is really a fail-safe gift. It can track fitness metrics, keep tabs on heart rate and health, go swimming, buzz with notifications, and so much more. It’s a true companion to the iPhone.
For the mobile gamer in your life, chances are they’d appreciate some dedicated controls for their favorite games. As excellent as Apple’s touchscreens may be, they just don’t compare to buttons and joysticks for games. Equip this with one of SteelSeries’s grips for another $10, and they’ll be off to the races – or, you know, Fortnite.
If your loved one lives a life aquatic – or is just a lovable klutz – they need the Lifeproof Fré iPhone case. This case is fully submersible in water that’s up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) deep for 1 hour. It’s also fully sealed with its built-in screen protector and port covers, so it’s safe from the elements.
With Belkin’s USB-C-to-Lightning Cable and USB-C Wall Adapter, anyone who has a newer iPhone can take advantage of faster charging speeds. The cable is also durable and well made, plus, it’s MFi certified by Apple to be safe.
It’s so easy to scratch or crack a phone screen by accident, so we recommend picking up a screen protector as a practical stocking stuffer. Zagg is famous for its screen protectors because they are durable, easy to apply, and some offer special features like blue light blocking and privacy shields.
Although there are truly wireless earbuds that sound better and cost more, Apple’s Airpods are among the best you can buy because they are just so simple and easy to use with an iPhone. They pair effortlessly, never lose connection, and they come in a wirelessly charging case that charges them.
For those that either have more expensive taste or want the absolute best and latest Apple tech, whoever you’re gifting will definitely appreciate the AirPods Pro – especially for its water resistance and active noise cancelling, neither of which the traditional AirPods have.
Although iPhone battery life has improved markedly over the years, it’s still a good idea to have a portable battery pack on hand for charging emergencies. Jackery makes our favorite battery pack because it has a good capacity and built-in lightning and micro USB cables so you don’t have to bring cables with you, too. The micro USB cable is great for charging a Kindle or wireless headphones.
Although the latest iPhones have great cameras, lens kits like this one from Olloclip make the photo quality even better. Your giftee can add fish-eye, macro, and wide-angle lenses to their iPhone with the Olloclip to take special photos.
There is nothing worse than running out of storage on your iPhone or struggling to transfer photos and files from your phone to your laptop. SanDisk’s iXpand Flash Drive for iPhone solves both problems with an elegant solution that works effortlessly.
The drive has a regular USB-A end that will fit in most laptops and a lightning end that fits all iPhones so you can offload files and transfer them back and forth. It’s great for extra photo storage.
Although sharing digital photos is fun, sharing physical photos is wonderful. Lifeprint’s portable photo printer can reproduce high-quality photos on special photo paper in a 3-by-4.5-inch size that’s perfect for sharing.
You can do lots of fun things with the app, too, and make your Live iPhone photos come to life as animated GIFs as you hold your phone above the printed photo. Lifeprint’s printers can communicate with each other, too, so if both you and your loved one have a Lifeprint printer, you can send photos to print at each other’s printers.
It’s all too easy to lose lightning cables, so it’s a great idea to stock up with a three-pack of Anker’s PowerLine cables. These 3-foot-long cables are sturdy, last a long time, and have good reach. They’re also our pick for the best iPhone lightning cable you can buy in our guide.
Just because it’s cold out doesn’t mean your iPhone-loving giftee is going to stop using their iPhone, so touchscreen gloves are the perfect gift for people in colder climes. L.L.Bean sells several different touchscreen glove options, so you can find a pair that fits your loved one’s style and hand size.
If your giftee has an iPhone 8 or newer, they’ll love this portable battery power bank, which doubles as a wireless charger. It has a 10,000mAh capacity, so it’ll charge an iPhone multiple times whether you want to juice up wirelessly or with your lightning cable.
When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is the most well-known brand and the Charge 3 is an excellent gift for iPhone owners who want to get and stay fit.
Driving without a car mount for your phone is a recipe for disaster, but luckily, you can get your loved one a phone mount like this one from iOttie for a great price. It adjusts to fit any iPhone and it’ll fit in any car’s air vent. It’s easy to angle any which way so you can see the phone properly when you drive. It’s a godsend for when you need GPS for driving directions.
Wireless chargers come in all shapes and sizes, and one of the coolest ones I’ve encountered is this desk lamp that doubles as a wireless charger. It even has a USB port at the back so you can charge with a cable, too. It also excels as a lamp, so I use it on my nightstand as a reading lamp and phone charger.
The lamp has five color temperature modes and seven brightness levels, so you can adjust it to suit your needs. The lamp’s head tilts up to 135 degrees and rotates up to 180 degrees, plus, the arm can be tilted up to 150 degrees and swivels 90 degrees, which is to say, this lamp will illuminate anything you want in just about any direction while charging your phone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">They could make a great Christmas present
(Image credit: TechRadar)
Have you been lusting over the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700? Well, you're in luck – the stellar noise-canceling headphones have dropped to their lowest price ever in a fantastic pre-Christmas discount. 
Beating any Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals we saw this year, you can now get these brilliant over-ear headphones for $349 in the US at Amazon - that's a discount of $50. 
In the UK? The savings get even better with a great deal at Peter Tyson, which cuts the price from £349 to just £285 – a saving of £64.
The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones are among the best noise-cancelling cans you can buy in 2019, with a fun, lively sound, and a head-turning design that stands out from the crowd – that's why we gave them 4.5 out of 5 stars in our review.
They're a little different to traditional noise-cancelling headphones, too; normally, they block out environmental sounds around you, so that you can hear your music more clearly (or catch some shut-eye on a noisy flight). 
However, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 apply noise cancellation to your phone calls as well – so the person you're speaking too can hear everything you say clearly even if you're stood on a busy street.
Audiophiles will be happy with the sound quality on offer here, too, as the 700s offer a wide, balanced soundstage and a vibrant character that makes them incredibly fun to listen with.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Farewell to the shark fin
The Oppo Reno 2 (Image credit: Future)
If you know the Oppo Reno series, you probably recognize the distinctive pop-up 'shark-fin' camera (as you can see in the image above). However it seems like the Oppo Reno 3 series is set to drop this stylish design quirk.
That's based on new images of the Oppo Reno 3 and Reno 3 Pro that have appeared on Oppo's Chinese website. Meanwhile, Oppo vice president Brian Shen has confirmed that there will be a 5G variant of the Reno 3, teasing an image of the front of the device, as well as a video showing the rear of the phone, on Twitter.
The images shared by Shen are labelled as showing the Reno 3 Pro 5G, but based on the Oppo Reno 5G and Reno 10x Zoom looking exactly the same, we'd expect the 5G device to be almost exactly the same as the non-5G Pro phone.
Other than the fact the Oppo Reno 3 would use a Snapdragon 765 chipset, we hadn't heard anything of the upcoming collection of phones before, but Oppo has constantly pledged itself to a 5G future, so it makes sense that the company is releasing another 5G device. 
There's a lot to unpack from the teases, but the main takeaway is that the 'shark-fin' will be no more. Instead, the Oppo Reno 3 will have a small notch, and the Pro (and presumably the Pro 5G) will have a 'punch-hole' cut-out like the Samsung Galaxy S10.
The lack of the shark-fin robs the Oppo Reno series of arguably its most distinctive feature – not as many people would have noticed the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom or Reno 2 if they looked like standard Android devices, and the upcoming phones look a lot less distinctive as a result.
Other than the sad absence of the shark-fin pop-up section, there are a few things we can tell about the upcoming Oppo Reno 3 and Reno 3 Pro from the images.
The images of the Reno 3 5G Pro also show that the screen curves around the edges of the device – that's a first for an Oppo device, and it's a design feature that's usually reserved for high-end devices, whereas the Reno phones are typically more mid-range.
Shen's caption also states the thickness of the Pro 5G will be 7.7mm, and based on that it looks like this phone will likely have a huge screen – we'd estimate it at around 6.8 inches, or at the upper limit for modern smartphone displays.
The new images also show us that the Reno 3 Pro and Pro 5G, and, but the looks of things, the Reno 3 Pro will have four rear cameras. That's the same number as the Reno 2, but we'd hope that some of the non-primary cameras were a little more powerful than on that device, as we found some of the snappers were distinctly underwhelming.
The camera array is at the top-left of the phone's rear now, not central and flush with the back of the device, as in previous Reno devices. The prior rear design was another distinctive feature of the Reno devices, and the new design looks a little more generic.
We've haven't yet heard about a launch date for the Oppo Reno 3 phones, but since we've seen this revealing look so far in advance of MWC 2020, it's possible that we'll see them before next year's mobile expo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What is AWS Glue?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keeping data together in the cloud
(Image credit: Pixabay)
Managing data is a full-time job for some (quite literally). Especially at a larger company, there may be requests to run an analytics report, move data from one repository to another, or even create “clean data” for an important new web application. In terms of data management, cloud computing services provide extreme flexibility in what you can do with data reporting, and there are quite a few tools available to help, especially for Amazon Web Services (or AWS).
AWS Glue is one of those data and cloud storage management tools. It’s known as a managed ETL, which means it is used to Extract, Transform, and Load data in preparation for reporting and analytics. AWS Glue is a data catalog for storing metadata in a central repository. It’s a way to automate ETL so that you point AWS Glue to the data that’s stored within AWS. The data becomes searchable and queryable for any of the reporting and cloud analytics you need to use.
It’s helpful to understand ETL before diving into AWS Glue and the benefits of using it. ETL is how data management employees at a company blend data so that it can be used for a query. There might be multiple data stores and multiple cloud databases, but the ETL readies the data without having to move any data stores. ETL essentially preps the data so that it is ready for analytics and reporting, as opposed to the alternative which is to actually move the data, isolate it, and then run queries in preparation for any analytics or reporting.
AWS Glue is the tool that generates ETL code for programming languages Scala or Python. Essentially, once you generate the catalog data, you can then perform searches and queries on the data using cloud computing tools such as Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum, all designed to help companies store and use data in applications. AWS Glue also works with Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) on Amazon EC2.
To understand what AWS Glue is, it’s helpful to understand how it works. For starters, data management employees, developers, and data scientists can use AWS Management Console to register the data sources. After crawling the data the ETL will then create catalogs using classifiers like JSON, CSV, and Parquet. Employees will then select a source for the ETL and generate the code needed for the reporting and analytics. Finally, the ETL can schedule recurring jobs and to prep the data for tools like AWS Lambda.
The main advantage of AWS Glue is flexibility. Many companies now use a data lake that contains a wealth of structured and unstructured data. In the past, companies were forced to move the data into a new repository, to endlessly manage the data, and to worry about the servers and infrastructure needed for their apps. Speaking of a fulltime job! That was a complicated time period in the history of Information Technology, all prior to the cloud.
With AWS Glue, there’s no need for a server on-premise (since it is all serverless and runs as a managed ETL) or even your own data center, your own local data management stores, or a dedicated employee who manages the data. Instead, AWS Glue is the glue that ties together disparate data and makes it ready and available for queries.
AWS Glue is also highly automated. It can crawl disparate data sources, identify the formats, and suggest how to use the data. Once AWS Glue does all of this, it can then generate the code you need for any data queries, transformations, or processes.
An important distinction to make here is that AWS Glue does all of its ETL processing in the cloud. That means employees don’t have to do any of the data management and prep that is often required to run ETL, such as managing endpoint security, configuring the data beforehand, moving the data to the right repository, or any of the more complicated steps such as configuring the data stores, managing storage, and configuring servers.
AWS Glue removes much of the headache involved with preparing data for analysis. Known as “heavy lifting” in the industry, it is the chore of making structured or unstructured data ready for queries. With AWS Glue, that is not needed. All of the discovery, cleansing, enriching, and moving of the data occurs behind the scenes as part of the ETL, making everything much easier for IT service management.
Because the cloud is so flexible, and there are so many different data stores, web applications, and business needs for reporting and analytics, AWS Glue helps bring some sanity to the data exploration process -- without having to do any of the back-end work first. It’s powerful in that it saves time and effort, and yet the queries can be repeatable and automated.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All the best super-sized 4K TVs
(Image credit: LG)
Sometimes, only a 75-inch TV will do. With a sense of scale far beyond smaller 55-inch or 40-inch sizes, and more big-screen models coming out every year, those wanting to go above and beyond will likely be after one of the best 75-inch 4K TVs for their next home television.
While a 75-inch TV may have seemed an absurd proposition even a couple of years ago, improved manufacturing processes and increased demand have made these behemoth screens more affordable and widespread than ever before. (Those after a truly leviathan display will need something like this 98-inch Samsung TV, but good luck affording it.)
That doesn't mean 75-inch TVs are cheap, though. You're still paying on average a lot more than smaller sizes, given the increased materials and higher-spec processors needed to make each pixel pop on such a large screen. If you see a 75-inch TV that's suspiciously affordable, it's likely using older LCD technology that was designed for smaller screens – and therefore won't be delivering the high-impact image quality you're no doubt after in this category.
So what are the best 75-inch 4K TVs, and where can you find them? You'll find everything you need in our buying guide below. 
Make sure to check back every few weeks, though, as we'll be updating this page with the latest 75-inch TV reviews – and given what we've seen so far of new sets like the TCL 8-Series 8K QLED, or LG's 8K NanoCell LCD, the top sets below could be beaten at any time.
First and foremost, be really careful about TV sales that sound too good to be true. If you see a 75-inch 4K TV for around $600, it's probably going to let you down in terms of picture performance.
So who's the main culprit that causes ugly images in the 75-inch range? Bad backlighting. While the cheapies use edge-lit LED panels that produce poor black levels and contrast, the bigger brands opt for either direct, full array LED panels – or in the case of LG, OLED panels. Both illuminate across the whole screen, and create both luscious color and 4K clarity.
Currently, our favorite 75-inch TVs are LG's series of OLEDs, which boast exceptional black levels and premium HDR. They're perfect for a dark room experience, like a home cinema, though for brightly-lit rooms you may want to consider Samsung's QLED TV series. Then there's Sony, whose efforts are impossible to ignore, and a few more affordable brands to tempt you to buy a 75-inch TV for relatively small spend.
Not sure where to start? Take a look at our favorite 75-inch 4K TVs right now, listed below for your convenience. Each series in this list has been tested and approved by our expert team of reviewers, so you can buy with confidence.
Brighter pictures are the key take away with this 75-inch behemoth
Screen size: 75-inch | Tuner: Twin Freeview HD/Twin Freesat HD | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: Smart Hub | Curved: No | Dimensions: 1680 x 337 x 1020 mm (W x H x D)
+ Cutting-edge image processing+ Wider viewing angles- Limited 8K content- No Dolby Vision or Atmos
When you're buying a TV of this size, you may want to start thinking about 8K. While there isn't much native 8K content out there to stream or play, the upscaling capabilities of high-end sets like the Samsung Q950R mean than even HD or 4K video can get an 8K overhaul, and the results speak for themselves.
Even if QLED panels can't match the contrast or black levels of OLED panels, the Q950R offers truly incredible image-processing, with more than enough strengths to make up for that disparity – and hugely improved viewing angles from even last year's QLED range.
Keep in mind that you only get the Samsung-backed HDR10+ format, rather than the competing Dolby Vision standard, meaning you won't be able to watch Netflix titles – and some Blu-ray discs – in the highest quality imaginable. The lack of Dolby Atmos, too, is a disappointment for those wanting premium audio to play through their TV speakers.
But for picture quality, smart interface, and the ability to futureproof for 8K content, make this simply the best 75-inch TV you could buy. (Don't worry, the rest of the list is cheaper.)
Read the full review:Samsung Q950R 8K QLED TV
An excellent OLED TV, now in a 77-inch size
Screen size: 77-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: OLED | Smart TV: webOS | Curved: No | Dimensions: 1722 x 1046 x 254mm
+ Dolby Vision and Atmos+ AI-enhanced smart platform- Lacks brightness vs LCD- Weaker speakers compared to higher end LG OLEDs
Not fussed about 8K? This 77-inch 4K OLED still offers startling crisp images and the vibrant colors and enhanced contrast that OLED panels are known for, with support for Dolby Vision, HLG, and Dolby Atmos audio.
With the well-organized webOS smart platform giving you easy access to the smart TV's many apps and services, and the OLED panel and upgraded a9 Gen 2 processor to make those images really pop – not to mention 2.2. channel speakers – there's very little to criticize in this excellent 2019 LG TV.
It won't go quite as bright as Samsung's QLED TVs, and may fall slightly behind on motion handling – but don't worry, you're still getting an exceptional, color-accurate picture that beats anything you'll see at the cinema. While it's available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, this larger model will have the biggest impact of the lot.

New for 2019, the 75-inch version of the 6-Series is a great value
Screen size: 75-inch | Tuner: N/A | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: LCD | Smart TV: Yes (Roku TV) | Curved: No | Dimensions: 66.1 x 40.7 x 15.9 inches (W x H x D)
+ Roku TV is great+ Bright, colorful HDR- Loss of darker details- Limited motion settings
It was announced at CES 2019 that TCL's awesome (and inexpensive) 6-Series would be getting a 75-inch version starting in 2019. The TV offers Dolby Vision support, and comes with Roku TV as its smart platform – though this size model is available exclusively to Best Buy in the US.
While TCL's 6-Series didn't impress us quite as much as the other TVs on this list, it is a competitive screen at its price point, offering bright, colorful HDR and exceptionally clear images.
If you have deep pockets and a checkbook filled with blank checks, we’d still tell you to reach deep and shell out for something higher on this list. But if the TCL 6 Series is what's in your budget, it will provide exceptional performance for the price.

Sony has the cheapest ticket to a 75-inch screen
Screen size: 75-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Panel technology: LCD | Smart TV: Android TV | Curved: No | Dimensions: 1447 x 829 x 69 mm (W x H x D)
+ Excellent HDR & SDR picture quality+ Clean, open sound- Android TV is frustrating- Divisive design
Need something cheaper than the TCL 6-Series? This Sony TV was released back in 2018 and retails for just a bit less – making it an even more accessible entry point for big-screen action.
It isn't the sleekest-looking set we've reviewed: the two large feet aren't quite becoming for the size of the screen, and you likely won't have a table big enough to rest it on. But Sony's direct LED lighting system with local dimming helps create some serious image quality, particularly during 4K HDR material. 
Meanwhile, the effect of Sony's X1 Extreme video processor is to remove noise so intensely that new levels of detail are revealed. On a big TV, that's important. We also love the way the XF900 up-converts standard dynamic range (SDR) images to HDR. 
In fact, the only thing we're really annoyed about on the XF90 is its use of Android TV as its smart TV system, which (Chromecasting aside) is both cluttered and confusing. The X900F is also available as an 85-inch version in the US, too.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget Black Friday, it's all about Green Monday
(Image credit: Future)
Black Friday is now well behind us, but that doesn't mean HP is stopping the deals, with its Green Monday sale providing some seriously impressive price cuts, including a huge $1,000 off the HP Elite Dragonfly laptop.
This is a powerful 2-in-1 convertible laptop that’s both incredibly light – at under 1kg – and long lasting, thanks to a battery that can go over 24 hours on a single charge.
Not only is it incredibly light, but it’s also incredibly durable as well, meeting the requirements for the MIL-STD 810G military standard.
Usually selling for $2,885, HP has cut the price to just $1,875.25 for one day only. This model comes with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and 13.3-inch full HD display.
If that's still a little too pricey, HP has also cut the price of a number of its laptops and PCs for its Green Monday sale, and we've listed some of the best below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deals abound on iPad Pro, Mini, and Air models
(Image credit: Future) Jump To:
If you're still to scoop up an iPad deal in the holiday sales you're in luck. We've found the cheapest prices for each iPad model from a range of your favorite retailers this week. Many of these deals are Black Friday / Cyber Week discounts still in stock at various retailers, meaning there's still time to save on iPad Pro deals and more. There's also still a healthy stock of iPad Air, and Mini deals about - all still carrying their seasonal sales price tags. 
Black Friday and Cyber Monday were fantastic times to shop for an iPad, with some of the lowest discounts on 2019 and last year's models we've seen in a while. Thankfully, a few of those sales linger on into this week, and we're still seeing decent discounts on iPad Pro and Air models as well as some cheaper prices on 2018's installments. 
If you're looking for the cheapest iPad deal possible, you'll likely be looking at lower storage items. Thanks to iCloud, the 32GB and 64GB storage options available are more than workable if you're looking to stream your entertainment and keep you larger files in the cloud. That said, if you're looking for a tablet to potentially replace your laptop, or if you're going to be running several high performance apps for some hardcore work, you might want to take a look at some of the roomier options. 
If the model you're looking for has since dropped out of the seasonal sales, there's always our roundup of the best cheap iPad deals going to keep your eye on. While you're restocking your Apple products, you might also be interested in the best AirPods prices around. There are still plenty of MacBook deals to keep an eye on as well!

Not only have we listed the very best printers for Mac, we've also included our own price comparison tool, so you'll get recommendations for the best prices as well, ensuring you get a brilliant deal.
Getting the best printer for your Mac means ensuring that it can easily connect to your Apple product either via wires or wirelessly. The best printers for Macs will also be capable of high print quality. Many of us use Macs for creative work, so we need Mac printers that will do our work justice.
Sophisticated Mac-friendly inkjet for creative types
Category: colour 3-in-1 inkjet printer | Print speed: 15ppm | Paper sizes: A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 6.6kg
+ 6-ink colour fidelity  + Attractive design- Expensive     - Small paper tray
This 3-in-1 inkjet printer looks and feels like a premium model and it has the specifications to match. It uses six individual ink cartridges to achieve superior colour fidelity and prints photos at a sharp 4800 x 1200 DPI resolution. It offers AirPrint connectivity for Mac users and includes an SD Cards slot for photographers. It can automatically print both sides of a page, scan at high-resolution and with the help of its rear paper feed, it can handle almost any kind of printable media from blank CDs to fingernail stickers. It is pretty compact, given the dazzling list of features, and it’s all controlled by a generously sized colour touchscreen.
A stylish small-in-one to match your Mac
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 23ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 500 | Weight: 12.1kg
+ Compact design  + Great price- Costly cartridges- No touchscreen
Epson has done well to shrink this three-in-one to the size of a square shoebox without losing any features. Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct and AirPrint make it easy to connect to an Apple device without the need for Ethernet or USB cables. It also offers auto duplex printing, convenient USB and SD card slots and the ability to print on a very wide variety of media from blank CDs to glossy A4 photo paper. It lacks a touchscreen display, but it’s easy to use and the print quality, especially with photos, is excellent.
Inexpensive and effective inkjet all-in-one
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet MFD | Print speed: 12ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 6.6kg
+ Compact and affordable   + SD Card and USB ports- Not fast - No fax facility
Brother’s entry-level inkjet 3-in-1 bundles all of the key features such as auto duplexing and cloud printing into a delightfully compact unit. The tilting display is easy to read, but if you’re using an Apple mobile device, you can download the free iPrint&Scan app, which particularly well thought out. There are USB ports front and rear, an SD Card slot and Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi Direct, so it’s well connected too. It prints somewhat slowly at 12ppm in mono, but duplex documents appear crisp and consistent and photos on glossy paper look lifelike enough for a budget model.   
Simple cartridge-free design hits the sweet spot
Category: mono inkjet printer | Print speed: 15ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 150 | Weight: 3.5kg
+ Very economical refills + Simple/pleasing design- Slow print speed- High initial cost   
The up-front price might seem daunting, but this print-only device includes enough black ink for 6,000 pages and refills are far cheaper than cartridges. Epson’s elegant design won a Red Dot award and we have to agree that there’s something refreshingly simple about topping up the visible reservoir with a bottle of ink. There are few features here, not even AirPrint, but the iOS companion app is excellent and it compliments a Mac particularly well. Wi-Fi is built in and it can turn out duplex pages at a somewhat slow, but steady rate of 15ppm and there’s room in this streamlined machine for 150 sheets of paper. 
Bargain AirPrint inkjet ticks (almost) all the boxes
Category: colour inkjet 3-in-1 | Print speed: 8ppm (mono) | Paper sizes: A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 4kg
+ Very low price+ AirPrint and Ethernet- No auto-duplex     - Slow to print
At this aggressive price point, you might not expect much from a printer, but this 3-in-1 can print, scan and copy in colour and at a decent resolution. There’s inbuilt Wi-Fi with AirPrint compatibility for Apple users, while Epson’s iPrint companion app makes it even easier to print and scan remotely via an iPhone, or iPad. Sadly, there’s no auto duplex mode and no LCD, but it is able to print on a wide variety of media with room for 100 sheets of plain A4 paper in the main paper tray, or 20 sheets of photo paper. Usually, the catch with cheap printers is the cost of replacement cartridges, but in this case Epson’s Starfish ink is quite competitively priced too.
Cartridge-less system smashes the page costs of this AirPrint all-in-one
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 13ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 250 | Weight: 6.5kg
+ High page yield  + Low ink costs- Not very fast- Expensive 
This costly, but cost-effective all-in-one AirPrint device has swapped its cartridges for refillable ink tanks. That slashes your per-page cost considerably and Canon has included enough ink for 6,000 black and white pages and 7,700 colour – hence the hefty price tag. It prints quite slowly, but with a paper capacity of 350 sheets (250 in the main tray plus 100 in the rear tray) and such a high ink yield, it can keep on printing. It comes equipped with Wi-Fi and auto duplex mode and can be easy controlled by the iOS/Android companion app. 
The Mac-friendly printer for photographers and designers
Category: A2 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 3ppm | Paper sizes: up to A2 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 8.7kg
+ Roll paper option+ Vivid A2 prints- Large footprint - High running costs 
This A2-size print-only device will suit any business that needs to turn out professional large format colour documents. The resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 dpi gets closer to that of your Mac monitor than most and it uses Epson’s nine-colour UltraChrome HD inkset for lifelike colour shading. These cartridges come in high capacity 80ml options, while the paper input can also be upgraded to hold a roll. Unsurprisingly, it takes up quite a bit of room and the cost is high, but it’s considerably lower than outsourcing your poster prints.
Easy AirPrint all-in-one
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 20ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 500 | Weight: 12.1kg
+ Instant Ink ready + Low price point  - Costly cartridges- Flimsy plastic
At less than £40 (around $52), this three-in-one printer is something of a steal. Of course the catch comes with the relatively high price of the inkjet cartridges, but if you take out HP’s Instant Ink subscription, even this cost drops. The printer itself is rather flimsy, but it’s well kitted out with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct and AirPrint in for easy mobile printing from your Apple device. The free iOS companion app is also particularly user-friendly.
Simple and small laser printer for the Mac user
Category: colour laser printer | Print speed: 18ppm | Paper sizes: A4 | Paper capacity: 150 | Weight: 10kg
+ Small in price and size+ AirPrint and Ethernet- No auto-duplex     - No display
This colour laser printer could not be smaller or more basic in its design. There’s no LCD, no front USB port and very few features. It can’t even print on both sides of the page. However, if you only want to print on plain A4 paper and don’t need auto duplex, then this refreshingly basic print-only device will do so quickly and cheaply. Being a laser, it easily undercuts the running costs of an inkjet. Wi-Fi with AirPrint is built in, so it’ll connect readily to a Mac, or iOS device and it’s one of the few printers we’ve come across that includes a USB cable in the box.
Canon cuts ink cost with its cartridge-less solution
Category: 3-in-1 colour inkjet printer | Print speed: 10ppm | Paper sizes: up to A4 | Paper capacity: 100 | Weight: 5.4kg
+ Low ink cost  + Plenty of ink included - High price point - Small display
By swapping ink cartridges for bottled ink, this inkjet printer has a far higher page yield and much lower per page cost. You can clearly see when the ink reservoirs are running low and with Wi-Fi built in and AirPrint compatibility, it’s easy to scan and print using your Apple device and the iOS companion app. It can auto duplex print and includes an automatic document feed and fax facility.

5G is typically expensive but it doesn’t have to be, as right now you can get the Moto Z4 for the remarkably low price of just $10 per month over 24 months.
That price is for the Moto Z4 from Verizon in Frost White or Flash Gray. It’s down from a standard price of $20.83 per month – so it’s less than half price, coming out at just $240 overall.
Technically, the Moto Z4 isn’t actually a 5G phone, but it can be – all you have to do is attach the 5G Moto Mod (sold separately for $349.99). So it’s still a relatively affordable way to get a 5G handset, especially at this discounted price. In fact, even at full price we declared this the cheapest of 2019’s 5G-capable handsets in our review.
And with or without 5G, the Moto Z4 is worth considering for your next phone. This is a decent mid-range handset, with a Snapdragon 675 chipset, 4GB of RAM, a 6.4-inch 1080 x 2340 OLED screen, a 48MP rear camera, and a 25MP front-facing one.
It also supports all Motorola’s other Moto Mods, so if you want an extra battery, better speakers, or a number of other things, you can clip them on.
It’s not clear how long this $10 per month offer will last, so if you’ve been eyeing up the Moto Z4 or a 5G phone in general, now’s the time to buy, and with Christmas around the corner it could also make a great present.

The Doogee S68 Pro is a sensible smartphone with a balanced configuration and a price tag that is actually very palatable. This is not a flagship smartphone like the Doogee S69 Pro, but it does offer a lot more than what you’d expect for the price, which is just under $200 (around £150, AU$300) at Gearbest.
Not only is this one of the cheapest handsets in the world to offer 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage, expandable to 1TB via an appropriate micro SD card, but it also runs on a speedy Mediatek Helio P70 CPU with a 5.9-inch full HD+ display, a massive 6800mAh battery and four cameras totaling 53-megapixels (including a Sony IMX230 21-megapixel camera). 
These are the headline features but the rest is just as good. A little known feature that it offers is wireless charging in either direction; it can be used as a charging mat, albeit trickling only 5W of power.
Don’t forget that this is an IP68/IP69K/MIL-STD-810G smartphone with plenty of protection and built to withstand some serious amount of abuse.
Other than running on Android 9.0 Pie, the presence of NFC and support for not one but four global navigation satellite systems, the Doogee S68 Pro offers Bluetooth 5.0 and 802.11ac connectivity. An excellent all-rounder that has set a new benchmark for mainstream rugged smartphone and will not break the bank.

(Image credit: Future)
If you're still looking for an Echo Dot deal to complete your smart home, you'll be happy to know you can pick up a smart speaker complete with a set of Philips Hue bulbs for a great price this week. This Echo Dot Philips Hue deal bundle was all the rage over Cyber week and is now back in stock at Amazon. You can get both a third generation Echo Dot smart speaker and two Philips Hue A19 smart bulbs for just $34 this week - that's less than the usual MSRP of either item on a normal day. 
You're essentially paying £17 for each of the items in this bundle, making this by far the cheapest we've ever seen them go for. The Echo Dot by itself is usually $49.99, making this an excellent saving just in time for the holidays. 
You're getting the standard third-generation Echo Dot everyone knows loves, with all its Alexa smart speaker goodness. But what's a smart home without bulbs? Two Philips Hue bulbs are also included in this deal. What's more, these particular A19 bulbs don't require a hub to work, meaning you don't have to shell out for that costly smart home brain to enjoy voice-controlled lighting. They link directly to Alexa through Bluetooth, leaving you with a stress-free and a reliable connection. 
Still shopping? We've gathered all the best Echo prices from around the web just for you. If you fancy even more Alexa integration, you can also find some amazing Fire Stick deals going at the moment. If you're on the fence about the Alexa ecosystem, you can always try these Apple Homepod deals.

(Image credit: Future) Jump To:
These Xbox One deals have just hit store shelves in a post-Cyber week frenzy of fantastic discounts and cheap gaming. You can save $150 on some of the most powerful gaming machines around today. Whether you're looking for an Xbox One S deal for a quick saving on a new console, or you've had your eye on a few Xbox One X deals for a while, these savings can get you straight in the game for less. These savings are seeing fantastic recent games bundled with each console as well as some impressive extra controllers or added bonuses across the US and UK. 
So which Xbox One deal do you go for? 
The Xbox One S is the standard version of the Xbox console. The One S grants you access to the Xbox library and a decent spec worthy of its current-gen standing. If you're looking to play some exclusives you missed this generation, or simply want to expand your collection for the cheapest price possible, now is the time to do so. 
The Xbox One X, on the other hand, is Microsoft's most powerful console to date. Running in 4K HDR with Dolby Atmos spatial audio, you're getting a premier gaming experience for your cash. You may be looking to upgrade your One S, or simply grab a beast of a machine straight from the off. The specs inside the Xbox One X make it buttery smooth and mean it can handle intense 4K resolution with fantastic ease, but that's also thanks to its 12GB of GDDR5 graphic memory. You're getting speedier load times, high-performance cooling, and enhanced gameplay with this beast of a console. 
With Project Scarlett on the horizon, these Xbox One deals are rapidly shifting in price to grab those final few gamers before the new console takes over. That's not to say you're going to be abandoning your console in a year's time. With Game Pass and the rate of uptake on newer consoles to consider, you'll likely get a few years of use out of the library already set up for Xbox. 
Microsoft themselves have discounted their Xbox One models, but here's our top picks from your favorite retailers. 
If you're looking for more of the best Xbox One X prices, we've been scouring the web to find all the bundles you should be looking at. If you've just bought your new console, you might also want to check out the best Game Pass deals or the best Xbox Live Gold prices around.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alexa is the new news
(Image credit: Amazon)
Have you spoken to a gadget today? There’s a good chance that have, with the number of voice-activated smart speakers and AI tasks rapidly growing as manufacturers and developers seek to cash in on the popularity of voice assistants like Alexa. When you can control gadgets, summon your favorite tunes, get a weather forecast and more simply by uttering a few words, why wouldn’t you?
But when it comes to the news, especially in a media landscape in which there are growing  concerns about misinformation in the form of ‘fake news’ – and with fact-checking processes by Facebook falling into disrepute – there’s an ongoing debate about what impact the increasing use of voice interfaces to access news will have.
While Siri was perhaps the first well-known voice assistant – and provided the inspiration for Spike Jonze’s Oscar-winning movie Her – Siri’s successors, Alexa and Google Assistant, have proved far more popular for and capable of delivering the news at our command. 
In October, we saw BBC News launch an Alexa-specific news service in a bid to engage with listeners through the popular voice assistant, with a mix of dedicated reporting and repurposed information from the BBC’s other editorial channels. (If you want to try it, just ask Alexa, “Give me BBC News”.)
To get our head around how voice search is changing the way news is accessed and distributed, and the possible consequences, we reached out to a number of figures working at the heart of digital news production and distribution.
We spoke to Mukul Devichand, executive editor at BBC Voice + AI, about the reasoning behind the British broadcaster’s dedicated Alexa news service, and what it meant for the dissemination of news in the future.
“Our journey has just begun on this,” said Devichand, calling the current Alexa service “the first iteration” in a much larger roadmap. “It’s pretty clear to me as a long-time producer and editor, that the way we tell stories should be revisited with each great shift in the internet.
“The growth of AI assistants has the potential to significantly disrupt the way we get information. Assistants offer an obvious and easy way to ask questions, which could be really transformative. What’s easier than just saying ‘tell me what’s going on’, or ‘did Brexit happen yet’, or ‘did Arsenal win the game,’ or ‘I don’t really understand why there’s a war in Syria’, to an assistant? So we may end up doing that instead of just tapping our phones.”
With smart speakers becoming fixtures in millions of homes worldwide, it’s imperative that news broadcasters cater to the new medium, in the same way they’ve adapted to scrolling news feeds and a generation accustomed to getting updates on demand through Twitter, Facebook, and Google News on their smartphones, rather than from the scheduled TV bulletins the BBC and other major broadcasters around the globe built their reputations on.
Devichand also acknowledges the changes and challenges that come with new methods of accessing information, suggesting that people today have an “expectation of 24/7 currency, and a genuine desire for interaction and depth on demand – with a great deal of confusion and mistrust given the way news is manipulated online”.
Why mistrust? “When algorithms or AI guide us to pieces of content, the dangers of misinformation, echo chambers and a polarized society are very real and present,” he explains.
Fake news is a big concern these days, whether it’s outright lies being thoughtlessly retweeted or news outlets distorting facts for the sake of a good story that readers will click on – with Facebook’s laid-back attitude towards misleading political ads proving highly controversial in the run-up to another election. 
The danger with voice search specifically is that, given the short and digestible snippets that Alexa and other smart assistants tend to provide, users could be getting an incomplete or overly simplistic picture of the day’s events, and perhaps seeing just one side of the story.
We talked to Matilde Giglio, an investor at venture capital firm Hambro Perks and a founder of Compass News, a news aggregation service that was founded with the aim of breaking news readers out of the echo chamber. Giglio sees voice search as a natural way of accessing news, even if it tends to take information out of its original context.
“Voice is seen rightly by publishers as a great opportunity to reach demographics that don't always tune into the news,” says Giglio. “The podcast boom shows how people love audio. Young people especially are turning away from mainstream sources, and they love the on-demand nature of voice that fits in with their daily routines.
“But publishers fear that they are losing control over their content when it's repackaged or curated to suit voice on demand, as with Alexa. The content also becomes separated from the publisher's own platform, and their brand risks becoming diluted.”
Giglio thinks there are opportunities for voice assistant developers to gain the trust of publishers, and the BBC News Alexa service may well be the start of a healthier relationship between news sources and the companies distributing their content.
BBC Voice + AI’s Mukul Devichand certainly thinks so, arguing that the service is a way to channel users back towards a trusted news platform, rather than giving them more leeway to dismiss sections of coverage:
“There’s been some comment since we launched the service, saying it could perpetuate echo chambers by giving people more control, but in fact it’s the opposite here – once they ask ‘Give Me BBC News’ they remain within a BBC experience that aims to be impartial and wide-ranging, and that’s the difference.”
As much as we value the convenience of a voice-based interface, or the immediacy of content funneled to us through various online channels, the ease with which we can share and receive information is the biggest obstacle to quality assurance, or basic fact-checking of what we hear and read.
Devichand speaks of the appeal of “conversational AI”, and some broadcasters and outlets may be taking steps in the right direction by gaining control of their editorial presence. However, if we’re more interested in the convenience of having a conversation with AI than it being an accurate one, that may make getting the truth into our homes increasingly harder.

Apple's initial foray into the smart home market doesn't regularly see many discounts, so this Apple HomePod deal from Best Buy is taking off. The smart speaker offers Apple's answer to Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, but carries a far more premium price tag thanks to its A8 processing and enhanced feature set. Catching any Apple HomePod deal makes for a great day, but saving $100 on one is even better. The Apple HomePod is currently available at Best Buy for $199. 
If you're looking for a smart speaker with more oomph, you might want to check out this higher-end model. Apple's contribution to the market offers vastly improved sound quality over its competitors, as well as spatial recognition to allow the speaker itself to adjust its audio to the room size and shape. There's a load of powerful tech inside this speaker, which goes a long way to justify its usual $300 price tag. You're getting a powerful audio quality here that you just don't see with other smart speakers. There's also a six-microphone array to ensure Siri can always hear you over the top of your room-filling tunes. 
This is an Apple speaker, however. That means you'll only be able to hook up the rest of your smart home if it is Apple Home Kit compatible. That shouldn't be a problem if you're just kitting out your smart home, or if you're just after a speaker with intelligent processing and Siri functionality but it is something to be wary of if you've already got an ecosystem going. 
This Apple HomePod deal is a rare opportunity to grab your Siri-enabled, high-performance speaker from Apple for less, so if you've had your eye on one in the run-up to the holidays, now is the time to jump. 
We keep track of all the best Apple HomePod prices so you can find the best deal on your new smart speaker. If you don't fancy spending that much cash right now, why not check out our best Echo Dot deals or our top picks of the best Google Nest Mini deals.

A new feature for Google Chrome has arrived that makes it easier to switch between browsing on desktop and mobile devices. The shared clipboard is a new tool that allows you to copy content from a computer and then paste it on an Android phone or tablet.
This means there's no need to send yourself an emails, or load a note-taking app like Evernote for sharing short snippets of text like addresses between devices.
As Techdows notes, the feature is enabled by default in the Android version of Chrome, so it's just the desktop version you have to tinker with.
The shared clipboard is currently only available in beta versions of Chrome for desktop, so start by installing Chrome Canary on your computer (it's available for Windows, Linux, macOS and Chrome OS).
Next, make sure you have Chrome installed on your Android phone, and ensure that you're logged into both browsers using the same Google account. Then follow these steps:
Now, highlight some text in the desktop version of Chrome, right click and select the 'Copy to [Android device]' option. The copied text will be sent to your phone – confirmed by a notification that pops up on your handset – ready for you to paste into Chrome there.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp dark mode: latest beta release gives us another early glimpse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dark times ahead
(Image credit: Shutterstock)
WhatsApp dark mode isn't quite ready yet, but image files tucked away in the latest beta release of the messaging app have given us a new glimpse of what the new, darker interface will look like.
The latest beta includes a set of new icons that, as WABetaInfo explains, will be used as avatars during calls when dark mode is active. The set includes three icons: one for broadcasts, one for individuals and one for groups.
The icons are similar to those already used in the app's light interface, but with more contrast to make them stand out better against darker backgrounds.
The call screen itself will also have a new look, with a slightly darker background, although this part of the app's interface is already on the darker side, so the changes here seem to be fairly minimal.
For some WhatsApp users, dark mode can't come soon enough. Last month, Android users reported that the app was draining their phones' batteries unusually quickly following a routine update. Although it initially declined to comment on the problem, Facebook (WhatsApp's parent company) acknowledged the issue by releasing a new update that it claims should resolve it.
If you still find WhatsApp too power-hungry, there's good news on the horizon – it looks as though the app's dark mode will be activated automatically whenever your phone is in battery-saver mode.
Light-colored pixels draw significantly more power than black ones, so switching to dark mode should help to reduce the amount of juice needed to power your screen when you're using WhatsApp.
This is particularly true for phones with AMOLED screens, where black pixels are actually switched off – and it seems that WhatsApp will have an additional extra-dark interface especially for these devices to make the most of this feature.
We don't yet know when WhatsApp dark mode will be rolled out; although there are lots of assets already tucked away in the beta release, it isn't ready for testing yet. It could arrive any time though, and we'll let you know as soon as it's available for you to install.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget the iPhone 12, this is the one to watch
2019's Samsung Galaxy S10 (Image credit: Future)
The Samsung Galaxy S11 isn't due until February 2020, but a steady stream of leaks have given us a pretty good idea of what to expect from Samsung's next flagship – and three new leaks offer more clues about the biggest S11 model, the Galaxy S11 Plus.
These leaks detail the battery size, camera specs, and rear design, of the S11 Plus (as we're expecting it to be called). The information comes from a range of sources, and we'll round it up for you.
As with all pre-release phone leaks, there are always reasons this information could be wrong, or fake, or both, so take it with a pinch of salt – but these rumors don't contradict what we'd already heard.
The first Galaxy S11 Plus leak details its battery capacity, which is set to be 5,000mAh, or 900mAh bigger than the battery in the S10 Plus. We've heard this rumor before, but this repeat backs up that assertion.
GalaxyClub managed to get its hands on a 5,000mAh battery that looks set to debut in the device – there's even a picture of the power pack, which clearly says 5,000mAh on it. 
If it does indeed get this massive battery, the Galaxy S11 Plus could last for a lot longer between charges – although because we're also expecting the display to be a lot bigger than the one on the S10 Plus, it may not last a great deal longer. 
Leak number two details the main camera on the Samsung Galaxy S11 (and presumably the S11 Plus too). We've already heard that this is set to be a 108MP snapper, but according to noted Twitter leaker @UniverseIce, it won't be the 108MP sensor we were expecting, but a completely different one. 
By saying 'exclusive', UniverseIce makes the distinction between the sensor it predicts we'll see in the Galaxy S11 sensor, and a previous 108MP sensor made by Samsung that debuted in the Xiaomi Mi Note 10.
According to the leak, this new sensor is much better than the previous one. We found the 108MP camera in the Mi Note 10 phone pretty impressive, and if the new sensor is even better, that could mean great things for Samsung's upcoming phones.
Leak three of three is some leaked pictures of the Samsung Galaxy S11 (or S11 Plus, it's not clear) in use. The pictures are rather blurry, but we can tell a bit about the phone from them.
The pictures, also shared by @UniverseIce, show someone scrolling the screen and taking a picture on what looks to be a pretty chunky phone. 
The big news here is that the camera array is in a different location to those on previous Galaxy S phones. While on current phones the cameras are arranged in a  horizontal block along the middle of the device, this image shows a vertical array on the left of the phone's rear – it looks a lot more like the Honor V30 than prior Galaxy S phones, in fact.
Many leaks have pointed to the smartphone having this design, which you can detail in our Samsung Galaxy S11 rumor roundup, but there are a variations between the leaks, so we're not totally sure if there will be two columns of cameras or just one long one.
This change is likely down to the anticipated cameras taking up more space, with a 108MP camera and 5x periscope lens, amongst other components, needing a lot of space.
One caveat here, though, is that there's no confirmation that this actually is the Galaxy S11, other than the leaker's word. Sure, they're a reliable leaker, but this doesn't look much like we'd expected the Galaxy S11 to, so we're certainly taking the images with a pinch of salt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Surface Book 3 could come with a radical new design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Detachable writing panel could make it better for artists
(Image credit: Microsoft)
The Surface Book 3 could come with a radical new design that incorporates a detachable keyboard with a panel on the back that could be used for sketching and note taking with a stylus.
The potential new design comes from a patent filing (spotted by Windows Latest), which is titled “Computing device with detachable writing input device” (catchy), and shows a computer that looks similar to the Surface Book with a detachable keyboard.
What sets it apart from previous Surface Book models is that next to the trackpad, beneath the keyboard, there is a small space for using a stylus to jot down notes.
More interestingly, when the detachable keyboard is flipped over, the back becomes a large 'writing surface”, which the user can use to write down notes or perhaps use it as a graphics tablet for hand drawing and sketching.
According to Microsoft’s patent, the detachable keyboard “also includes a second side [...] that includes a writing surface. The user may use a pen, finger, or other implement to draw on the writing surface.”
This could make the Surface Book 3 (or whatever upcoming device Microsoft is thinking of including this feature with) a very useful tool for artists and graphic designers, as well as anyone who prefers writing out notes by hand.
If this new detachable keyboard is indeed coming to the Surface Book 3, or similar device, then it could represent a welcome return to the design innovation that we felt recent Surface products have lacked.
The recently-released Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3, for example, were two devices that offered only minor upgrades compared to their predecessors, while playing it very safe when it came to design.
By taking a more radical approach to the Surface Book 3’s design, Microsoft could end up with a much more exciting device.
A few words of caution before you get too excited, though. First of all, while the Surface Book 3 is likely to happen at some point (we’d guess a 2020 release date), Microsoft has not officially announced it.
Secondly, this is just a patent, and many patents never actually end up as finished products. If the Surface Book 3 is coming, there’s no guarantee that it will feature the new detachable keyboard.
Still, we live in hope that Microsoft has taken on board the criticisms its latest round of Surface devices got, and is planning some big changes when it comes to the designs of its flagship products. 
If it doesn’t, it might find enthusiasm for its Surface devices beginning to seriously wane.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fulfilling promises
(Image credit: OnePlus)
When OnePlus TV was announced, they made it clear that the software was a big part of the experience. However, Netflix wasn’t natively available back then on the smart TV. That is finally changing with a new software update.
The OnePlus smart TV Q1 and Q1 Pro were made their global debut in India, alongside the OnePlus 7T. Back then, the company promised that Netflix would be a part of the included app ecosystem at a future date. Starting today, all OnePlus TVs sold will have Netflix pre-installed, whereas existing users will receive a software update that will add the entire content catalog of the OTT platform.
The OnePlus TV remote originally had a rather minimal design with only a few buttons, one of them being Prime Video by Amazon. Video streaming platforms usually have a mandate for a dedicated button to launch their app if a smart TV wants to have their content natively supported. It raised a few questions during the launch about how OnePlus will add support for Netflix as the remote had no extra buttons.
The solution came in the form of a new remote, which changes a few things and adds a new Netflix button that can launch the app even if the TV is sleeping. The new remote has a matte black finish and brings the volume rocker to the facia rather than the side. The keys to summon Google Assistant and Prime Video are still present. Going forward, all OnePlus TVs will ship with this new remote.
Existing users can get the new remote for free from the OnePlus Store after their serial number is verified to be from one of the earlier shipment batches. The exact process is detailed on their website if you wish to get your hands on the OnePlus TV Netflix remote.
The OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro run on a customized Android TV OS with better connectivity with smartphones. It sports a 55-inch QLED panel with a 4K resolution and starts at Rs 69,900 in India.

(Image credit: UsTwo Games) Page 1 of 10: Game of the week and the best Android racing games
There are loads of great games available for Android, but how can you pick out the gems from the dross, and amazing touchscreen experiences from botched console ports? With our lists, that’s how!
We cover the best titles on Android right now, including the finest racers, puzzlers, adventure games, arcade titles and more.
- Racing games- Adventure games- Arcade games- Endless runners- Platform games- Puzzle games- Shooting games- Sports games- Strategy games- Word games
We've tried these games out, and looked to see where the costs come in - there might be a free sticker added to some of these in the Google Play Store, but sometimes you'll need an in app purchase (IAP) to get the real benefit - so we'll make sure you know about that ahead of the download.
Check back every other week for a new game, and click through to the following pages to see the best of the best divided into the genres that best represent what people are playing right now.
Dig Dog - Treasure Hunter is a hectic arcade effort that plays out like Dig Dug or Boulder Dash in fast forward. The titular hound hunts for treasure, and must dig its way through levitating islands. Said islands are, naturally, populated by all manner of monsters, and happen to hang over spike pits.
Figuring out where the prize is, ensuring you’ve always got a route back toward the surface, and keeping baddies at bay, are all part and parcel of the pooch’s day – and it’s a hard life. Even when you master super-fast digging actions, it’s easy to miss a foe, or – after digging a little too far – find yourself rapidly heading towards the spikes.
Still, an easy mode gives you a fighting chance of getting to grips with a game that’s hugely rewarding when mastered, marrying old-school cool with modern app design.
Our favorite Android top-down, 3D and retro racers.
Repulze exists in a future beyond racers driving cars far too quickly; instead, they’re placed in experimental hovercraft that belt along at insane speeds. Track design’s traditions have also been ditched, flat courses being replaced by roller-coaster-like constructions that throw you around in stomach-churning fashion.
The game’s split into three phases. It begins with time trials that have you pass through specific colored gates, and ends with you taking on AI opponents, occasionally – and unsportingly – blowing them up with weapons.
There’s a sci-fi backstory about synthetic men and corporations, but really this one’s all about speed. At first, the twitchy controls will find you repeatedly smashing into tracksides and wondering if someone should take your hovercraft license away. But master the tracks and controls alike, and Repulze becomes an exhilarating experience as you bomb along toward the finish line.
Rush Rally 3 brings console-style rally racing to Android. For quick blasts, you can delve into single rally mode, with a co-driver bellowing in your ear; or there’s the grinding metal of rallycross, pitting you against computer cars apparently fueled by aggression. If you’re in it for the long haul, immerse yourself in a full career mode.
None of those options would matter a jot if the racing wasn’t up to much. Fortunately, it’s really good. The game looks the part, with very smart visuals and viewpoints, whether belting around a racing circuit or blazing through a forest.
The controls work well, too, providing a number of setups to accommodate a range of preferences (tilt; virtual buttons) – and skill levels. All in all, it’s enough for the game to get that coveted checkered flag.
If you're fed up with racing games paying more attention to whether the tarmac looks photorealistic rather than how much fun it should be to zoom along at insane speeds, check out Horizon Chase. This tribute to old-school arcade titles is all about the sheer joy of racing, rather than boring realism.
The visuals are vibrant, the soundtrack is jolly and cheesy, and the racing finds you constantly battling your way to the front of an aggressive pack.
If you fondly recall Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge and Top Gear, don't miss this one. (Note that Horizon Chase gives you five tracks for free. To unlock the rest, there's a single £2.29/US$2.99 IAP.)
Anyone expecting the kind of free-roaming racing from the console versions of this title are going to be miffed, but Need for Speed: Most Wanted is nonetheless one of the finest games of its kind on Android. Yes, the tracks are linear, with only the odd shortcut, but the actual racing bit is superb.
You belt along the seedy streets of a drab, gray city, trying to win events that will boost your ego and reputation alike. Wins swell your coffers, enabling you to buy new vehicles for entering special events.
The game looks gorgeous on Android and has a high-octane soundtrack to urge you onwards. But mostly, this one’s about the controls – a slick combination of responsive tilt and effortless drifting that makes everything feel closer to OutRun 2 than typically sub-optimal mobile racing fare.
The first two Riptide games had you zoom along undulating watery circuits surrounded by gleaming metal towers. Riptide GP: Renegade offers another slice of splashy futuristic racing, but this time finds you immersed in the seedy underbelly of the sport.
As with the previous games, you’re still piloting a hydrofoil, and racing involves not only going very, very fast, but also being a massive show-off at every available opportunity.
If you hit a ramp or wave that hurls you into the air, you’d best fling your ride about or do a handstand, in order to get turbo-boost on landing. Sensible racers get nothing.
The career mode finds you earning cash, upgrading your ride, and probably ignoring the slightly tiresome story bits. The racing, though, is superb – an exhilarating mix of old-school arcade thrills and modern mobile touchscreen smarts.
Mini Motor Racing is a frenetic top-down racer that finds tiny vehicles darting about claustrophobic circuits that twist and turn in a clear effort to have you repeatedly drive into walls. The cars handle more like remote control cars than real fare, meaning that races are typically tight – and easily lost if you glance away from the screen for just a moment.
There’s a ton of content here – many dozens of races set across a wide range of environments. You zoom through ruins, and scoot about beachside tracks. The AI’s sometimes a bit too aggressive, but with savvy car upgrades, and nitro boost usage when racing, you’ll be taking more than the occasional checkered flag.
Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit exists in a world where the police seem to think it’s perfectly okay to use their extremely expensive cars to ram fleeing criminals into submission. And when they’re not doing that, they belt along the streets, racing each other to (presumably) decide who pays for the day’s doughnuts.
It’s a fairly simple racer – you’re basically weaving your way through the landscape, smashing into other cars, and triggering the odd trap – but it’s exhilarating, breezy fun that echoes classic racers like Chase H.Q.
And once you’ve had your fill of being one of the nitro-happy fuzz, you can play out a career as the pursued as well, getting stuck into the kind of cop-smashing criminal antics that totally won’t be covered by your car manufacturer’s warranty.
Final Freeway 2R is a retro racing game, quite blatantly inspired by Sega’s classic OutRun. You belt along in a red car, tearing up a road where everyone’s rather suspiciously driving in the same direction. Every now and again, you hit a fork, allowing you to select your route. All the while, cheesy music blares out of your device’s speakers.
For old hands, you’ll be in a kind of gaming heaven. And arguably, this game’s better than the one that inspired it, feeling more fluid and nuanced. If you’re used to more realistic fare, give Final Freeway 2R a go – you might find yourself converted by its breezy attitude, colorful visuals, and need for truly insane speed.
Motorsport Manager Mobile 3 is a racing management game without the boring bits. Rather than sitting you in front of a glorified spreadsheet, the game is a well-balanced mix of accessibility and depth, enabling you to delve into the nitty gritty of teams, sponsors, mechanics, and even livery.
When you’re all set, you get to watch surprisingly tense and exciting top-down racing. (This being surprising because you’re largely watching numbered discs zoom around circuits.) One-off races give you a feel for things, but the real meat is starting from the bottom of the pile in the career mode, with the ultimate aim of becoming a winner.
It’s all streamlined, slick, and mobile-friendly, and a big leap on from the relatively simplistic original Motorsport Manager Mobile.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Presumably due to stock shortages

Fed up of rebooted movies? Or remakes of old games? Creativity and originality are dead in contemporary culture, you say? Well we’re not sure how you’ll feel about the prospect of ancient processors rising from the silicon grave, but this is exactly what Intel has done with its latest move in the CPU arena.
Intel’s Pentium G3420 is a Haswell chip based on a 22nm process which was released back in Q3 of 2013, over six years ago now, but as Tom’s Hardware spotted, it has been resurrected and is now back on the chip giant’s roadmap.
In a product change notification document, Intel let customers know that: “Cancelling this Product Discontinuance completely per new roadmap decision and enabling the product long term once again.”
The dual-core Pentium processor, which has a base clock speed of 3.2GHz, will apparently be sold through to May 2020.
So what’s this all about then? Surely no one wants to buy an old and crusty Pentium which was first released six years ago?
Well, no, not in the consumer sphere anyway, but this chip is aimed at PC manufacturers (for use in cheap builds) and the likes of the embedded market and thin clients.
The reason it could have been brought back, as Tom’s Hardware theorizes, is perhaps to help cope with demand in such markets, given that Intel is struggling to make enough contemporary CPUs (and thus might need to fall back to an older process, to help pick up some of the slack).
We recently heard Intel apologize for these processor shortages, which have been ongoing for some time now, and are set to remain a problem.
Investing ‘record’ levels of capital to boost 14nm production throughout the course of 2019 simply hasn’t been enough, and we have previously heard that Intel has shifted to use 22nm on CPUs which are on the fringe to help deal with demand – and arguably that might be the case here.

We're still waiting for WhatsApp dark mode to arrive on our phones, but another long-awaited feature has finally arrived on Android handsets: call waiting.
As MSPowerUser explains, the new feature is so simple, you might be surprised it didn't already exist. Until now, if you were using WhatsApp to make a call and someone else tried to call you, they would hear an 'engaged' tone, but you wouldn't receive any kind of notification to tell you they were attempting to reach you.
With the new call waiting feature, you'll be able to see that someone else is trying to reach you, and accept the call if you want.
To use call waiting, simply ensure your app is updated to version 2.19.352 or later and it will be enabled automatically. You can find out which version you're using by long-pressing the app icon and scrolling down to the bottom. It may take a couple of days for the update to roll out worldwide.
Another feature arriving with this update is the long-awaited ability to stop strangers adding you to groups. This option was first discussed in April, but is only now being rolled out to Android users. 
If you enter the app's settings and select Settings > Account > Privacy > Groups, you should see three options that determine who can add you to a group. Selecting 'Nobody' will prevent anyone from adding you to a group unless you accept an invitation by private message, 'My contacts' will only allow people in your address group to add you to groups, and 'Anyone' will (you guessed it) let anybody add you to groups, including strangers.
The feature is intended to make it harder for spammers to add people to groups and bombard them with unwanted advertising or misleading information.
WhatsApp also claims to have fixed an issue that caused the app to drain battery power unusually quickly on some Android handsets. Of course, the forthcoming dark mode will also be a great way to make the app draw less juice, but there's still no word on when that will arrive. We'll keep you updated as soon as we know more.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The wait is almost over.

The Apple Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR monitor release date has been revealed as Tuesday, December 10, with the high-end Mac and professional monitor likely shipping soon after.
The Mac Pro (2019) release date was confirmed by Apple itself in an email sent to selected customers.
While it's not certain exactly how long units will take to make their way to customers, you might find a new Mac Pro under your tree for Christmas (if you have a loving relative with very deep pockets).
There had been rumors of a December launch date, and indeed Apple was fast running out of time to make good on its promise that the Mac Pro and the Pro Display XDR were "coming this fall".
The hardware was originally shown off at WWDC 2019 back in June, but we've had to wait until now for an official launch date – and there have been three new iPhones and a new MacBook Pro since then.
We're still waiting for Apple to clarify the Mac Pro configurations and pricing, but expect full details on December 10. We do know that the base model is going to cost you a hefty $5,999 (about £4,565 / AU$8,765).
That will get you an octa-core Intel Xeon W chip, 32GB of memory and AMD Radeon Pro 580X graphics. Once you start upgrading those different components, the price is going to rise even higher.
As for the Pro Display XDR, the starting price for that is set at $4,999 (about £3,805 / AU$7,305), and that's without the stand. Obviously these pieces of hardware are aimed at the premium end of the market.
For the time being the Apple website still shows the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR as "coming soon", but that will change on December 10 – when all the questions about shipping and configurations will be answered.

(Image credit: TechRadar)
If you didn't manage to pin down that perfect headphones deal over Black Friday, you haven't missed your chance – as these Sennheiser Momentum Free Special Edition in-ear headphones are back at their lowest price ever.
At just £69.99, down from an original £179.99 RRP, you're saving over a hundred pounds for high-quality audio in a stylish Sennheiser package – all the better for being the black-and-red Special Edition exclusive to Amazon.
This deal is now live at Amazon until midnight on December 22, 2019 – or until stock on this offer runs out.
Sure, true wireless earbuds are all the rage these days, and you may find yourself drifting towards the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless instead, which currently sit at around £199. 
But if you aren't fussed about completely untethered audio, the Momentum Free earphones will still offer top-notch audio, just with a connected cable and in-line remote (which is somewhat more practical than the True Wireless model's touch controls, anyhow).
This model has been on the market for almost two years now, though, so you will be getting the slightly older Bluetooth 4.2 standard – rather than the latest 5.0 standard, which is more power-efficient and boasts a greater wireless range.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new innovation for both
2019's iPhone 11 Pro (Image credit: Future)
Two of the world's most prolific phone manufacturers may be able to supply larger batteries on the next series of flagship phones thanks to a recent battery innovation.
Apple may be able to introduce the new technology on its next series of iPhones as well as Samsung introducing it on the Galaxy S11 as well as presumably the Galaxy S11 Plus and Galaxy S11e.
According to Korean website The Elec, industry sources claim both companies will be using smaller battery protection modules on upcoming phones. That would provide space for a larger capacity battery cell without increasing the size of the phone.
Battery protection modules ensure your phone doesn't overcharge, but this slimming down doesn't do away with the technology altogether. It's instead combining two elements of the battery support together to help slim the space it takes up down.
ITM Semiconductor - a Korean supplier - is expected to be providing the tech to both companies. It's rumored to make the space needed for battery protection modules drop by almost 50%, so that may provide a significant increase in battery capacity if either company sees fit.
This is a new report that is expected to have a potential influence on all four rumored versions of the next iPhone series. 
Currently, we're expecting four iPhone 12 named devices and there may even be a more affordable handset launched alongside without the iPhone 12 moniker.
Previously we've heard similar battery tech rumors about the Galaxy S11 from the same source that claimed the company will be supplied with these smaller battery modules. 
There's no gurantee either Apple or Samsung will use this extra space for extra battery though. It may be this extra space is available in the device, but either company decides to instead slim its devices down, so take all of this with a pinch of salt for now until we hear official word from either company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft adds ‘campaign views’ phishing intel to Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft is rolling out a new email security feature designed to give businesses greater insights into phishing campaigns targeted at their workforce.
Phishing, for the uninitiated, is where a cyber attacker pretends to be someone that they are not in an email message, with a view toward tricking the recipient (e.g., a company employee) into carrying out an action such as clicking on a malicious link or giving over confidential information. Phishing attacks are among the biggest security headaches that companies face today, with a recent U.K. government report noting that “phishing emails [are] becoming more believable, and therefore harder to detect.”
And it’s against that backdrop that Microsoft revealed today that it’s launching “campaign views” as part of its Office 365 Advance Threat Protection (ATP) security suite. Microsoft launched Office 365 ATP back in 2015 to help protect organizations against malicious email messages. In addition to the existing security features Microsoft already offered against malware, viruses, and spam, ATP ushered in additional smarts including protection against unknown malware and viruses with no known signature.
With campaign views thrown into the mix, companies can now garner great context and visibility into email phishing campaigns, including how attackers are targeting them and which users within the organization are most vulnerable. So if an attack is successful, and an employee clicks on a malicious link contained within an email, for example, security teams can take steps to contain the breach and minimize the impact. More broadly, campaigns views can also help highlight inherent weaknesses in companies’ security so they can take corrective action in the future.
Through campaign views, security teams can see an overview about a specific phishing campaign, including a timeline of the sending pattern. It also shows a full list of IP addresses and senders, which messages were blocked, quarantined, delivered to the junk folder, or landed in the inbox and — crucially — which specific users were compromised.
One of the ways email phishers evade automated security systems is through making slight tweaks to each email, which may include changing the URL of a malicious link, using multiple IP addresses, employing different domains, and altering the hosting infrastructure. This polymorphous approach makes it harder for security software to spot campaigns. But by gathering all this attacker-specific intelligence and making it visible to security teams, campaign views can better enable security teams to improve their proactive defenses at a later date.
The increasing sophistication of phishing attacks has helped numerous tech startups attract venture capital (VC) funding — in the past six months alone, Valimail, Vade, and Ironscale collectively raised around $140 million for various automated technology products designed to protect companies from phishing attacks.
The campaign views feature was announced earlier this year, but it’s rolling out from today in public preview, and it should be visible to most users in the coming days and weeks.
The timing of the campaign views launch is also particularly notable, since the holiday season is typically ripe for phishing attacks as attackers bombard inboxes with malicious emails masquerading as special offers and fantastic deals.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Android augmented reality is about to take some nice steps forward today, as Google is adding a major new feature to its ARCore toolkit for developers: a Depth API capable of creating depth maps with a single device camera. Rather than requiring differential data gathered from two cameras or a dedicated time of flight sensor, the new Depth API will automatically snap multiple images as you move a single camera around and then compare the images to estimate your distance from each pixel.
Alone, that feature would be impressive, but Google’s intended use of the API is even better: occlusion, a trick by which digital objects can appear to be overlapped by real-world objects, blending the augmented and real worlds more seamlessly than with mere AR overlays. Starting today, occlusion is available in Scene Viewer — a Google developer tool for AR in Search — to over 200 million Android devices with ARCore.
There are myriad potential applications of proper depth-mapping and occlusion in AR, and Google is already suggesting how some of them will work, including an updated Houzz app that better places digital sample furniture models in real-world spaces and demos that can sense real surfaces and objects to enable digital objects to interact with and bounce off of them.
While the Depth API is supporting single-camera devices without conventional depth sensors, it’s also anticipating that time-of-flight sensors will enable even faster, dynamic occlusion that will be able to hide parts of digital objects behind real moving objects. The last three generations of iPhones have included front-facing depth sensors, certain recent Samsung and LG devices have started to add time-of-flight rear cameras, and other companies are expected to follow their lead in 2020.
Developers interested in getting access to the new Depth API will need to respond to Google’s call for collaborators, as the software apparently isn’t being made generally available to everyone quite yet. Users can see the new features in action in the latest release of the Houzz app for Android, available in the Play Store.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google proposes hybrid approach to AI transfer learning for medical imaging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Medical imaging is among the most popular application of AI and machine learning, and with good reason. Computer vision algorithms are naturally adept at spotting anomalies experts sometimes miss, in the process reducing wait times and lightening clinical workloads. Perhaps that’s why although the percentage of health care organizations that have adopted AI remains relatively low (22%) globally, the majority of practitioners (77%) believe the technology is important to the medical imaging field as a whole.
Unsurprisingly, data scientists have devoted outsize time and attention to developing AI imaging models for use in health care systems, a few of which Google scientists detail in a paper accepted to this week’s NeurIPS conference in Vancouver.  In “Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging,” coauthors hailing from Google Research (the R&D-focused arm of Google’s business) investigate the role transfer learning plays in developing image classification algorithms.
In transfer learning, a machine learning algorithm is trained in two stages. First, there’s retraining, where the algorithm is generally trained on a benchmark data set representing a diversity of categories. Next comes fine-tuning, where it is further trained on the specific target task of interest. The pretraining step helps the model to learn general features that can be reused on the target task, boosting its accuracy.
According to the team, transfer learning isn’t quite the end-all, be-all of AI training techniques. In a performance evaluation that compared a range of model architectures trained to diagnose diabetic retinopathy and five different diseases from chest x-rays, a portion of which were pretrained on an open source image data set (ImageNet), they report that transfer learning didn’t “significantly” affect performance on medical imaging tasks. Moreover, a family of simple, lightweight models performed at a level comparable to the standard architectures.
In a second test, the team studied the degree to which transfer learning affected the kinds of features and representations learned by the AI models. They analyzed and compared the hidden representations (i.e., representations of data learned in the model’s latent portions) in the different models trained to solve medical imaging tasks, computing similarity scores for some of the representations between models trained from scratch and those pretrained on ImageNet. The team concludes that for large models, representations learned from scratch tended to be much more similar to each other than those learned from transfer learning, while there was greater overlap between representation similarity scores in the case of smaller models.
To rectify these and other issues, the team proposes a hybrid approach to transfer learning, where instead of reusing the full model architecture, only a portion of is resused and the rest is redesigned to better suit the target task. They say that it confers most of the benefits of transfer learning while further enabling flexible model design. “Transfer learning is a central technique for many domain,” wrote Google Research scientists Maithra Raghu and Chiyuan Zhang in a blog post. “Many interesting open questions remain, [and we] look forward to tackling these questions in future work.”
The work comes shortly after Google detailed an AI capable of classifying chest X-rays with human-level accuracy. In another recent study, teams from the tech giant claimed to have developed a machine learning model that detects 26 skin conditions as accurately as dermatologists and a lung cancer detection AI that outperformed six human radiologists.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel previews AI advances in software testing, sequence models, and explainability</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week marks the kickoff of Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), one of the largest AI and machine learning conferences globally. NeurIPS 2017 and NeuIPS 2018 received 3,240 and 4,854 research paper submissions, respectively, and this year’s event — which takes place from December 8 to December 14 in Vancouver — is on track to handily break those records. (Submissions this year overwhelmed NeurIPS’ website, which crashed minutes before the official deadline.)
Researchers from Intel will be in attendance, as will those from tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber, Alibaba, Baidu, and countless others. For its part, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said it intends to host three dozen conference, workshop, and spotlight sessions covering topics like deep equilibrium models, imitation learning, machine programming, and more.
“Intel is making significant strides in advancing and scaling neural network technologies to handle increasingly complex and dynamic workloads — from tackling challenges with memory to researching new adaptive learning techniques,” wrote Dr. Rich Uhlig, senior fellow and managing director of Intel Labs, in a blog post. “The developments we’re showcasing at NeurIPS will help reduce memory footprints, better measure how neural networks process information, and reshape how machines learn in real time, opening up the potential for new deep learning applications that can change everything from manufacturing to health care.”
One area of research Intel plans to highlight is software development automated with machine learning. In a recent paper titled “A Zero-Positive Learning Approach for Diagnosing Software Performance Regression,” a team from Intel Labs, MIT, and Texas A&M University proposed AutoPerf, an approach to automate regression testing (errors introduced by new code check-ins) in high-performance compute code. Leveraging only nominal training data and hardware performance counters (HWPCs), or sets of special-purpose registers built into processors that store metrics from a wide range of hardware-related activities, the paper’s authors demonstrated that AutoPerf can detect some of the most complex performance bugs found in parallel programming.
AutoPerf’s secret sauce is zero-positive learning (ZPL), a semi-supervised machine learning technique initially developed for anomaly detection. Performance defects are treated as irregularities that deviate from the expected behavior of a given piece of software, which the system uses to train autoencoders (i.e., types of machine learning models that learn representations from sets of data). As for the HWPCs, which track things like processor cycles elapsed, cache hits and misses, branch predictions, and instructions executed, they serve as a mechanism to collect information on software activity without modifying source code or introducing performance-impacting overhead.
The researchers report that in experiments involving three types of regressions across 10 bugs in seven benchmarks and programs, AutoPerf hasn’t flagged a false negative. On average, it exhibits 4% profiling overhead and accurately diagnoses more performance issues than prior state-of-the-art approaches, including issues missed by expert programmers.
Might robot algorithms learn quickly and easily from human demonstrations? Researchers at Intel, alongside contributors from the University of California, Berkeley and startup Covariant.ai, assert that they can in a paper titled “Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning.” The team proposes a novel model — goalGAIL — that’s able to learn better than an expert demonstrator and that can even perform in situations with non-expert actions. They believe it could broaden robotic applications across industrial settings where algorithms might need to adapt quickly to new parts, as well as in personalized robotics, where models must adapt through demonstration to personal preference.
As the coauthors of the paper explain, a versatile form of self-supervision for robotics involves learning how to reach any previously observed state on demand. An AI model can be trained to seek to have its observation exactly match a predefined goal. However, the reward isn’t often observed in practice, because it’s extremely rare to encounter the exact sensory input twice. A technique called Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) solves this by relabeling a collected trajectory, replacing its goal with a state actually visited during that trajectory. But it’s not perfect — in cases where a specific state needs to be reached before a whole new area of the space is discovered, learning takes an inordinate amount of time. (Think navigating narrow corridors between rooms, or picking and placing an object with a mechanized arm.) That’s where goalGAIL comes in. By leveraging imitation learning, it’s able to obtain a demonstration from an expert that crafts a reward.
The researchers report that goalGAIL converges faster than HER and achieves a better final performance.
A team of Intel researchers will discuss a new approach to machine learning on sequence data, or data where the order matters. In a typical model, neurons — mathematical functions — are arranged in interconnected layers that transmit “signals” from input data and slowly adjust the synaptic strength (weights) of each connection. That’s how they extract features and learn to make predictions. The authors of “Deep Equilibrium Models,” who hail from Carnegie Mellon and Intel, say they’ve managed to replace popular multi-layered architectures with a single-layer architecture that can reach state-of-the-art performance on language benchmarks while reducing the memory footprint by 88%.
This novel construction, which the team calls a deep equilibrium model (DEQ), directly finds the points toward which multi-layer networks converge via root-finding, an algorithm for finding zeroes of continuous functions. On the open source WikiText corpus, which contains over 100 million words, it’s on par in terms of performance with Google’s Transformer-based architecture, a multi-layer model that selectively adjusts the weightings between its elements. That’s an impressive feat — Transformer models have massive memory requirements (in this case up to 9GB versus the DEQ’s maximum of 3.7GB) and can only be trained quickly on specialized hardware.
A convolutional network — a type of AI model most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery — requires substantial computing resources, memory bandwidth, and storage capacity to ingest and process data. One method of speeding the analysis is quantiziation, or the process of approximating a model with a “compressed” version of that model. But recovering the accuracy lost as a result often requires full data sets and time-consuming fine-tuning.
That’s why an Intel team partnered with a researcher from Technion in Israel to develop a quantization approach that doesn’t involve either fine-tuning or the use of a large corpus. Instead, their 4-bit post-training quantization targets models’ weights and their activation functions (the bit of a function that defines its output given an input or set of inputs). And it suggests three complementary methods — analytical clipping for integer quantization, per-channel bit allocation, and bias correction — for minimizing quantization error. This enables it to achieve accuracy that’s just a few percents less than the state-of-the-art baseline across a range of convolutional models, the team reports in a coauthored paper titled “Post Training 4-Bit Quantization of Convolutional Networks for Rapid-Deployment.”
“[Our work] introduces the first practical 4-bit post training quantization approach,” wrote the researchers. “Neural network quantization has significant benefits in reducing the amount of intermediate results … Our main findings in this paper suggest that with just a few percent accuracy degradation, retraining [convolutional] models may be unnecessary for 4-bit quantization.”
Explainability with respect to AI and machine learning is an area of intense study at Intel, and researchers there believe they (in partnership with scientists from MIT) have developed measures to better understand at least one category of model: speech models. In a paper accepted at NeurIPS 2019 (“Untangling in Invariant Speech Recognition“), they explain how they employed a recently developed statistical mechanical theory that connects the properties of AI model representations and the separability of classes to probe how data is untangled within the models.
According to the team, this statistical approach enabled them to observe that speaker-specific nuisance variations are discarded by the model’s hierarchy, whereas task-relevant properties such as words and phonemes (units of sound that distinguish one word from another in a particular language) are untangled in later layers. Higher-level concepts such as parts-of-speech and context dependence also emerge in the later layers of the network, while deep representations carry out significant temporal untangling by efficiently extracting task-relevant features at each time step of the computation.
“Both a [convolutional] architecture and [an] end-to-end [automatic speech recognition] model converge on remarkably similar behavior, despite being trained for different tasks and built with different computational blocks. They both learn to discard nuisance acoustic variations and exhibit untangling for task relevant information,” wrote the researchers. “Taken together, these findings shed light on how deep auditory models process time-dependent input signals to achieve invariant speech recognition, and show how different concepts emerge through the layers of the [model].”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Optane essentials, Part 2: Memory modes and optimal workloads</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This article is part of the Technology Insight series, made possible by funding from Intel.________________________________________________________________________________________
In Part 1, we covered the media foundations of Intel Optane technology and the different implementations of that media into three products: Optane Memory, Optane SSDs, and Optane DC persistent memory modules (DCPMMs). We also touched on how Intel software is a key ingredient in turning 3D XPoint into Intel Optane. We’ll round out our 101 with a brief look at configurations and modes.
Why? While it’s true that Optane DCPMMs require 2nd Generation Xeon Scalable processors or later, much of the Optane magic hinges on how software – especially in settings such as virtualized cloud, AI/analytics, and HPC –  can make optimal use of Optane when that media is configured into given modes.
DCPMMs can be configured into three possible modes: Memory Mode, App Direct Mode, and Dual Mode. Note that DCPMMs do not replace DRAM; you still need some DRAM in the system. But how much DCPMM capacity you complement the DRAM with will depend on your mode and specific application needs.
Memory Mode turns DRAM into an L4 cache. The cache is non-addressable and doesn’t show up in system memory counts, so all user-addressable capacity is the sum of the DCPMM capacities. No programming is needed for Memory Mode, but data contained in DCPMMs is volatile, just like with DRAM. Memory Mode provides a large memory pool with low but effective DRAM cache investment.
 
App Direct Mode allows the system to handle DRAM and DCPMM resources independently, so operations that require top speed can address DRAM and the rest can rely on larger Optane resources. Under App Direct, data in DCPMM remains persistent, which can be very helpful in minimizing large configuration reload times following a power cycle or reset. However, applications must be optimized to take advantage of App Direct. Some are already, and more are coming. Also, some user programming may be needed.
Dual Mode is a sub-set of App Direct Mode that allows some DCPMM resources to operate in Direct Mode and the remainder in App Direct.
DCPMM modes, especially the first two, tend to get the most attention for performance reasons. However, if we turn our attention to Optane SSDs, we can employ Intel Memory Drive Technology back across the CPU’s PCI Express bus. In effect, Memory Drive is much like Memory Mode, including in having data volatility, only Optane SSDs are serving in place of DCPMMs. Naturally, there’s more latency involved in reaching out to SSD resources, but the size of memory pool possible can be relatively gargantuan. As a way to contain costs on projects that require memory capacity above all else, Memory Drive can be a life-saver.
Speaking generally, Optane media excels when working with large volumes of real-time data that require low-latency access. Taking that one step further, we might add the following characteristics:
As mentioned previously, DCPMMs can be configured for either persistent or volatile operation and features latencies that are near DRAM in performance. This lends DCPMMs to deployment with workloads such as:
Returning to Optane SSDs, especially when running in a Memory Drive configuration, the following workload types perform particularly well:
For non-volatile workloads, you might consider Optane DC SSDs in applications such as:
Essentially, any storage application that suffers from I/O bottlenecking is a solid Optane SSD candidate. Also, if server monitoring tools reveal that CPU utilizations are low, this may be a sign that applications and/or VMs are memory-bound and could benefit from DCPMMs.
And that’s about it for the Optane basics. We expect the technology to slowly make more inroads in the client space, but today it remains a clear data center play. Exactly how much cost advantages and performance gains can be provided by Optane implementations will depend on an organization’s specific needs and workloads.
But the ability to bring storage so much closer to the CPU, to the point that it becomes indistinguishable from memory, is compelling and certain to open new opportunities for application developers and enterprises alike.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WalkMe raises $90 million to help people navigate user interfaces with on-screen prompts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WalkMe, a “digital adoption platform” (DAP) that helps companies integrate on-screen product walkthroughs into their software, has raised $90 million in a round of funding led by Vitruvian Partners, with participation from Insight Partners.
This takes WalkMe’s total funding to more than $300 million, including its $50 million series F round last November, when it was valued at more than $1 billion. The company says it has nearly doubled its valuation over the past year, which should put it at around $2 billion.
Founded in 2011, San Francisco-based WalkMe creates tools that enable software makers to build user-focused help functionality into their products. This may include things like tip-balloon overlays to highlight new or notable features that can be leveraged to train employees or onboard new customers. The technology can also be used to push users toward redeeming a free trial or to convert free users to a paid account. The WalkMe platform also leans heavily on automation to make real-time contextual suggestions based on how a user is interacting with an interface.
With every company now effectively becoming a software company, the need to reduce bounce rates and increase product adoption through user-friendly interfaces has never been as important. This is why being able to track how customers use online properties is so important. Companies use various tools to monitor drop-off rates on websites, thereby helping to identify areas that cause the most friction for customers and make improvements. WalkMe works in a similar vein, insofar as companies use it to glean insights into end-user behavior, but on top of that it injects support tools into apps and websites for situations where a user may be likely to drop off.
A number of companies operate in the DAP space, including San Jose’s Whatfix, which raised a $12.5 million investment earlier this year, and Raleigh’s Pendo, which raised $100 million two months ago at a $1 billion valuation. As it happens, WalkMe filed a lawsuit against Pendo last year, alleging that Pendo’s use of “lightboxes” and “tooltips” to help guide users through a software application violated its intellectual property — a New York District Court judge dismissed the case in April of this year.
WalkMe said it now works with some 2,000 clients globally, and in Q2 of this year it passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). With another $90 million in the bank, it plans to double down on its global growth, with a particular focus on Latin America.
“This latest round of funding speaks to our success and to the untapped potential of digital adoption,” said WalkMe cofounder and president Rafael Sweary. “WalkMe transforms how organizations gain visibility into their end-to-end business processes, driving workforce productivity, increasing customer satisfaction, and achieving higher operational efficiencies.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel Labs unveils cryogenic control chip for quantum computing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel Labs unveiled a first-of-its-kind cryogenic control chip — code-named Horse Ridge — that will speed up the development of quantum computing systems.
Horse Ridge will enable control of multiple quantum bits (qubits) and set a clear path toward scaling larger systems — a major milestone on the path to quantum practicality. The challenge of quantum computing is that it only really works at near-freezing temperatures right now. Intel is trying to change that, but the control chip is a step toward enabling control at very low temperatures, as it eliminates hundreds of wires going into a refrigerated case that houses the quantum computer.
Developed in partnership with Intel’s research collaborators at QuTech at Delft University of Technology, Horse Ridge is fabricated using Intel’s 22-nanometer FinFET manufacturing technology. The in-house fabrication of these control chips at Intel will dramatically accelerate the company’s ability to design, test, and optimize a commercially viable quantum computer, the company said.
A lot of research has gone into qubits, which can do simultaneous calculations. But Intel saw that controlling the qubits created another big challenge to developing large-scale commercial quantum systems, said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware, at an Intel press event. This kind of work has been going on for more than five years at Intel’s research campus in Ronler Acres, Oregon.
“It’s pretty unique in the community, as we’re going to take all these racks of electronics you see in a university lab and miniaturize that with our 22-nanometer technology and put it inside of a fridge,” said Clarke. “And so we’re starting to control our qubits very locally without having a lot of complex wires for cooling.”
In the race to realize the power and potential of quantum computers, researchers have focused extensively on qubit fabrication, building test chips that demonstrate the exponential power of a small number of qubits operating in superposition.
However, in early quantum hardware developments — including design, testing, and characterization of Intel’s silicon spin qubit and superconducting qubit systems — Intel identified a major bottleneck toward realizing commercial-scale quantum computing: interconnects and control electronics.
With Horse Ridge, Intel introduces a solution that will enable the company to control multiple qubits and set a clear path toward scaling future systems to larger qubit counts — a major milestone on the path to quantum practicality.
“We’re looking at what it’s going to take to scale quantum systems to a large number of qubits,” said Richard Uhlig, managing director of Intel Labs, in an interview with VentureBeat. “And we need to get there because until you get to thousands or millions of qubits, you’re not really going to be solving the interesting problems. If you want to do that, you have to have a strategy for configuring, reading out the state of qubits in large numbers. And today, those control electronics need to run at higher temperatures than the qubits themselves.”
Quantum computers promise the potential to tackle problems that conventional computers can’t handle by leveraging a phenomenon of quantum physics that allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously. As a result, qubits can conduct a large number of calculations at the same time — dramatically speeding up complex problem-solving.
Intel acknowledged that the quantum research community is still at mile one of a marathon toward demonstrating quantum practicality, a benchmark for determining whether a quantum system can deliver game-changing performance to solve real-world problems. Intel’s investment in quantum computing covers the full hardware and software stack in pursuit of the development and commercialization of a practical, commercially viable quantum system.
“Qubits run at low temperatures because they’re fragile,” Uhlig said. “Any noise, like thermal noise, will cause them to de-cohere. The control electronics therefore have to run at low temperatures too, unless you want to send a bunch of wires into it.”
To date, researchers have been focused on building small-scale quantum systems to demonstrate the potential of quantum devices. In these efforts, researchers have relied upon existing electronic tools and high-performance computing rack-scale instruments to connect the quantum system inside the cryogenic refrigerator to the traditional computational devices regulating qubit performance and programming the system.
These devices are often custom designed to control individual qubits, requiring hundreds of connective wires into and out of the refrigerator. However, this extensive control cabling for each qubit hinders the ability to scale the quantum system to the hundreds or thousands of qubits required to demonstrate quantum practicality, not to mention the millions of qubits required for a commercially viable quantum solution.
With Horse Ridge, Intel radically simplifies the control electronics required to operate a quantum system. Replacing these bulky instruments with a highly integrated system-on-chip (SoC) will simplify system design and allow for sophisticated signal processing techniques to accelerate set-up time, improve qubit performance, and enable the system to efficiently scale to larger qubit counts.
“One option is to run the control electronics at room temperature and run coax cables down to configure the qubits. But you can immediately see that you’re going to run into a scaling problem because you get to hundreds or thousands of cables and it’s not going to work,” Uhlig said. “What we’ve done with Horse Ridge — that’s the code name for this cryo CMOS controller — is that it’s able to run at temperatures that are much closer to the qubits themselves. It runs at about 4 degrees Kelvin. The innovation is that we solved the challenges around getting CMOS to run at that at those temperatures and still have a lot of flexibility in how the qubits are controlled and configured.”
Horse Ridge is a highly integrated mixed-signal SoC that brings the qubit controls into the quantum refrigerator — as close as possible to the qubits themselves. It effectively reduces the complexity of quantum control engineering from hundreds of cables running into and out of a refrigerator to a single unified package operating near the quantum device.
Designed to act as a radio frequency (RF) processor to control the qubits operating in the refrigerator, Horse Ridge is programmed with instructions that correspond to basic qubit operations. It translates those instructions into electromagnetic microwave pulses that can manipulate the state of the qubits.
Named for one of the coldest regions in Oregon, the Horse Ridge control chip was designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures — approximately 4 degrees Kelvin. To put this in context, 4 Kelvin is only 7 degrees Fahrenheit and 4 degrees Celsius warmer than absolute zero — a temperature so cold that atoms nearly stop moving.
Intel said this feat is particularly exciting as Intel progresses its research into silicon spin qubits, which have the potential to operate at slightly higher temperatures than current quantum systems require.
Today, a quantum computer operates at in the millikelvin range — just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. But silicon spin qubits have properties that could allow them to operate at 1 degree Kelvin or higher temperatures, which would dramatically reduce the challenges of refrigerating the quantum system.
As research progresses, Intel aims to have cryogenic controls and silicon spin qubits operate at the same temperature level. This will enable the company to create a solution with the qubits and controls in one streamlined package.
“It’s a fully working controller, one that we’ve demonstrated at at at those temperatures,” Uhlig said. “And, you know, we’ve been able to show that it works successfully, with full flexibility on the waveforms that you can even send down to the qubits for the purpose of control and readout.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nvidia trains AI to transform 2D images into 3D models</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nvidia Research created an AI system that can predict 3D properties of 2D images without any 3D training data. The work will be presented at the annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, where researchers in academia and industry share the latest in cutting-edge machine learning. Now in its 33rd year, the conference formerly known as NIPS will take place this week in Vancouver, Canada. With more than 13,000 participants, NeurIPS is the largest AI research conference of the year.
The work, which was conducted by researchers from Vector Institute, University of Toronto, Nvidia Research, and Aalto University, is detailed in the paper “Learning to Predict 3D Objects with an Interpolation-based Differentiable Renderer.”
For next steps, Nvidia director of AI and paper coauthor Sanja Fidler told VentureBeat in a phone interview that the company may attempt to extend the differentiable rendering framework (DIB-R) to more complex tasks, like rendering 3D models for multiple objects or entire scenes. Such work could have applications in gaming, AR/VR, robotics, or object tracking systems.
“Imagine you can just take a photo and out comes a 3D model, which means that you can now look at that scene that you have taken a picture of [from] all sorts of different viewpoints. You can go inside it potentially, view it from different angles — you can take old photographs in your photo collection and turn them into a 3D scene and inspect them like you were there, basically,” she said.
A number of deep learning in 3D works have already been developed. Facebook AI Research and Google’s DeepMind have also made 2D to 3D AI, but DIB-R is one of the first neural or deep learning architectures that can take 2D images and then predict several key 3D properties, such as shape, 3D geometry, and color and texture of the object, Fidler said.
“So there [are] quite a few previous works, but none of them really was able to predict all these key properties together. They’re either focusing on just predicting geometry or perhaps color, but not … shape, color, texture, and light. And this really completes — not [a] fully complete, but [a] much more complete understanding of the object in a scene,” she said.
A related work at NeurIPS attempts to predict the shape of people’s voices based on the sound of their voice.
“I think this is a very interesting domain,” Fidler said. “We didn’t tackle it in this particular paper, but in terms of deep learning, it’s another interesting input that you can provide to the neural architecture, and you can get really good 3D information. Nowadays, I think that’s definitely valid.”
DIB-R follows the release earlier this year of Kaolin, an Nvidia 3D deep learning library with a range of models to help people get started on 3D processing with neural nets.
Nvidia will present five papers at NeurIPS and will participate today in a number of collocated workshops, like Queer in AI, Latinx in AI, Black in AI, and Women in Machine Learning in AI.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bosch and Daimler launch self-driving car pilot in San Jose</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bustling San Jose — the third-largest metropolis in California, according to the 2010 census — is about to become a testbed for autonomous cars developed by Bosch and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler. Last November, the two jointly reaffirmed that they’ll pilot driverless vehicles in Silicon Valley as part of an on-demand offering revealed in July 2018. This morning, the companies announced the launch of a service in San Jose with a fleet of around 30 autonomous Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicles, though only a select group of users will be able to hail them initially.
Mercedes-Benz sedans capable of level 4 driving, or automated navigation requiring little to no human input or oversight (as outlined by the Society of Automotive Engineers), service communities along the San Carlos Street and Stevens Creek Boulevard thoroughfares between downtown and west San Jose. Intrepid riders tap Daimler’s Car2Go car-sharing service — plus MyTaxi (which the automaker acquired in 2014) and Moovel, an app that compares the price and duration of ride- and bike-sharing services, public transit, and other means of transportation — to summon rides from designated pickup locations.
The sedans aren’t completely self-driving — at least not currently. Safety drivers monitor each trip from the driver’s seat, Daimler and Bosch said, ready to take control in the event of an emergency. And the vehicles only operate during daytime hours, “when demand is the greatest.”
Daimler’s fleet platform handles backend logistics, and in the future it will allow ride-hailing partners to integrate autonomous vehicles from a range of manufacturers (including Mercedes-Benz). The platform launched for conventional (i.e., human-driven) vehicles in the Bay Area this fall following a debut in Berlin, Germany, and for this pilot it orchestrates day-to-day maintenance tasks, in addition to basic operation.
As previously announced, Nvidia’s Drive Pegasus provides the computational horsepower needed for the Mercedes-Benzs’ real-time decisioning. A powerful processor and graphics chip manages the network of electronic control units (ECUs) — the sensor-equipped microcontrollers that control the transmission, door locks, windows, and other systems. And a custom cooling system keeps the ECUs chilly as they churn through up to 100 gigabytes of data per kilometer of distance traveled.
Nvidia unveiled Nvidia Drive PX Pegasus at GTC Europe in October 2017 in Munich, Germany. The company’s two Xavier system-on-chips and dual graphics cards are capable of performing more than 320 trillion operations per second, Nvidia claims, and of transferring up to a terabyte of data a second while ingesting data from up to 16 cameras and six lidar sensors. Bosch and Daimler estimate the performance is on par with about six “synchronized, highly advanced” desktop computers and assert that Pegasus — drawing on a bevy of radar, vision, and ultrasound sensors — can react to changing road conditions within 20 milliseconds.
“If automated driving is to become everyday reality, the technology has to work reliably and safely. And this is where we need tests such as our pilot project in San Jose,” said Dr. Michael Fausten, head of engineering for urban automated driving at Bosch. Dr. Uwe Keller, who is head of autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz, added: “It’s not just the automated vehicles that have to prove their mettle. We also need proof that they can fit in as a piece of the urban mobility puzzle. We can test both these things in San Jose.”
Bosch and Daimler took the wraps off their self-driving partnership in 2017, with the goal of getting self-driving cars on roads in the next decade. It’s a symbiotic relationship: Bosch supplies components such as sensors, actuators, and control units, and Daimler contributes development vehicles and test facilities.
Both companies have at their disposal a million-square-foot proving ground designed especially for automated driving, which is located in Germany. There, they’re able to model complex traffic situations with high accuracy and as often as desired, complementing tests performed in simulation.
Bosch has made its autonomous driving ambitions abundantly clear. Last year, it created a new Connected Mobility Services division staffed with more than 600 employees, acquired B2B ride-sharing startup Splitting Fares, and partnered with TomTom on mapping systems that’ll help vehicles see the road ahead.
Daimler, for its part, in June 2018 obtained a permit from the Chinese government allowing it to test self-driving cars powered by Baidu’s Apollo platform on public roads in Beijing. (It already has permits for testing self-driving cars in the U.S. and Germany.)

As reported before the chinese ELEPHONE brand is not holding back with their expansion plans and next target for it is Pakistan. Yesterday at the Serena hotel in Islamabad they had a big launch party and conference to usher the brand to the local market. It has been attended by more than 150 guests, including local government officials, operators, dealers, embassy officials, as well as local media journalists. Miss Hareem Farooq will also work together with them as a brand spokesperson to introduce ELEPHONE products to more Pakistani users.
This conference symbolized the official beginning of the journey of ELEPHONE in Pakistan and of course the brand needs also the distribution platform. The official ELEPHONE Pakistan brand store is now online too so it’s already available and serving the local customers. The initial portfolio of products is maybe even bigger than originally expected and features not just phones, but also the smart wearables including watches and smartbands.
Specifically there are phone models like the flagship ELEPHONE U2 with pop-up dual selfie cameras and Helio P70 processor, cheaper ELEPHONE PX with single pop-up selfie camera and Helio P23 or the budget ELEPHONE A6 Max and A6 Mini for the more money conscious users. And from the smart wearable section the Pakistani customer can choose from the W3 smartwatch model or Band 5 and W7 GPS smartband models.

Trends change over time and the smartphone sector is one of the most innovative today. The sliding mechanisms, the notch, the pop-up camera … Many are the novelties that have reached the market over the years and all of them have the same purpose which is making the most of the device screen without losing photographic quality. Well, Xiaomi is already preparing a new system that can revolutionize everything with the upcoming Xiaomi Mi Mix 4.
We have already been able to see this design in some Oppo, LG or Samsung device, all of them are prototypes in which the camera would be hidden under the screen so as not to have to depend on another system to include the sensor. Xiaomi was one of the first brands that joined this trend , and the Chinese company continues to show interest in a mechanism that can become the trend of the future.
The Asian giant remains one of the manufacturers that include more innovation in its devices. The 108-megapixel camera of the Mi Note 10 has been one of Xiaomi’s latest surprises, and everything seems to indicate that the photographic system will continue to be one of the highlights of the Chinese company in the future. On this occasion, we talked about a new mechanism that includes as a base the inclusion of the front camera under the screen.
ITHome has been the medium that has revealed the first details of a patent in which a mechanism that can give a new air to the design appears. The new mechanism is based on the transmission of light caused by pixels that can be controlled at will. That is, the light can pass through the screen to the sensor to take the picture. Without having to resort to another type of mechanism. That is why the panel would display the images as usual and would change when using the front camera. From that moment, the selected pixels will begin to act so that the sensor can capture the light. And capture the photograph.
Since the opening of the new section dedicated to photography, Xiaomi has greatly improved its cameras. Without a doubt, one of the weak points of the brand since its inception. Now, the Chinese company is able to release top photographic systems such as the Mi Note 10. And some innovations as outstanding as the camera under the screen. We will see how this issue evolves and when the first mobile of this type comes to market (expected to be the Xiaomi Mi Mix 4).

Xiaomi eco-chain of products has really a vast range of available goodies and gadgets, which is a blessing for a customer right before the Xmas shopping spree. You can find more or less anything in their portfolio, even though some products are not directly branded by Xiaomi and rather launched via subsidiary makers. And today we have for you two interesting Xiaomi gadgets from stocks on Ebay, the handy portable Xiaomi Pocket AR printer and Baseus ENCOK E09 wireless speaker and alarm clock.
Portable printers based on the zinc print technology is nothing new, but still it’s a very neat system of instantly making smaller photos without the need for ink or toner. Not to mention the portable size fitting easily in a pocket. Xiaomi Pocket AR printer is just like that and can offer compact dimensions, 3-inch images printed on self-adhesive photo paper, AR video printing function, voice photo and much more. On Ebay you can find either the printer for just $58.99 or you can opt for some extra photo papers packaged in. Like 20pcs of the photo paper with the printer itself for just $66.49.
Many of us are relying just on your mobile phones to wake us up with the alarm, but the nightstand alarm clocks are certainly not dead either. Especially when you have such universal device like the Baseus ENCOK E09 from Xiaomi eco-chain filling various roles. It is an alarm clock with dual alarms and two adjustable light modes, wireless Bluetooth speaker with dual 3W speakers and 40mm driver units or FM radio. Built-in 1500 mAh battery should offer more than 40 hours of standby time if needed or 6 hours of music playback. You can get it in pink, black or white color for just $25.99.

The Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite continues to leak. While the launch is imminent, an online retailer has unveiled the price of both smartphones in Europe.
A leak came to lift the veil on the price of the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite in Europe as reported by our colleagues at GSMArena this December 9. Datart, an online retailer based in Slovakia, has mistakenly put online the prices in euros for both smartphones.
The Galaxy S10 Lite, renamed Galaxy A91 in some markets, will be visibly marketed at a price of 669 euros ($740). Attention, the real price in other European countries can obviously vary of some tens of euros. Not surprisingly, the device is a little cheaper than the Galaxy S10e , which is sold for 749 euros ($830).

Side technical sheet, there is a Snapdragon 730/735 SoC supported by 8 GB RAM and internal storage of 128 GB.
In the process, Datart also unveiled the European price of Galaxy A71 and Galaxy A51, new midrange phones. The Galaxy A71 will be sold at a price of 469 euros ($520). Against 375 euros ($415) for the Galaxy A51. Both smartphones come with a punch-hole for the front camera like the Galaxy Note 10.

With the end of the Galaxy S10 Android 10 beta program, Samsung is working hard to deliver the update for the Note 10 duo. Last week, the company rolled a fourth beta version for the Galaxy Note 10 duo.
Now, we have new information regarding the official release of the stable version for the Galaxy Note 10 & Note 10+. It will start to roll out before the end of this year. The community manager at Samsung’s official forum in South Korea has confirmed it. It is the same guy who has a record to announce the accurate dates of Android 10 beta updates. The fixed release date has not unveiled yet, but the other guy with the user name Galaxy3813 has mentioned that stable update would release before December 25. He is a brand ambassador at the Samsung Community forum & helping others in beta testing.
This means that the 4th beta will be the last one for the devices. The beta community manager has also confirmed that the Galaxy Fold is not going to get the beta version. Last week, the company has declared any Galaxy A series devices will not get the beta version, instead, they will get a stable version.
The last firmware version carries G97**XXU1ZSL4 and weighs around 540MB in size. The update comes to address a reboot issue while playing music. Those who were missing the lack of vibration when separating the S-Pen will be happy to know that this update comes to fix this. Last but not least is fixes the issue that made apps failing to run normally even after all permissions were granted.
At the end of last month, Samsung has released stable One UI 2.0 with Android 10 version for Galaxy S10 series smartphones. It rolled out for both beta & non-beta users. The latest update has now spread in all the major countries. Now it is time for Galaxy Note 10 & Note 10+ users to taste the new One UI 2.0 with Android 10 update. We will inform you when the company reveals the official release date.

Following the Snapdragon 835, Snapdragon 850 and Snapdragon 8cx released in the previous months, American tech giant – Qualcomm – continued to work very closely with Microsoft to explore the concept of “fully connected PCs” even further. This cooperation brought us the freshly released Snapdragon 7c and Snapdragon 8c platforms. Two more SoCs that increase the leadership of Qualcomm in the Windows 10 on ARM ecosystem.
Now, while the cooperation appears to be working well for the two companies, the flip side is that Qualcomm is currently the only tech firm providing a processor for the platform. Thus why some call it “Windows 10 on Snapdragon” instead of its real name “Windows 10 on ARM”.
Qualcomm isn’t the only company interested in the Windows 10 on ARM though. MediaTek and Samsung are currently working to supply a dedicated chip platform for the ecosystem as well. But another brand might be joining the party – Chinese tech giant Huawei.
Huawei would be advantaged by their maturity in the ARM chip design technology, with the additional bonus that the company could use the tech on high-performance servers, instead of just smartphones and IoT products.
Currently, Huawei produces the Huawei Kunpeng D920S10 desktop motherboard. The PC component supports quad-core or eight-core ARM processors and 64GB DDR4-2400 RAM. Plus it has SATA 3.0 ports, PCIe 3.0 slots, USB 3.0 port, USB 2.0 ports a Gigabit Ethernet etc.. Therefore, it wouldn’t be too difficult for Huawei to build a Win10 on ARM machine based on the Kirin or Kunpeng platform.
Either way, at the moment, Windows 10 on ARM only supports 32-bit programs; bringing a worse efficiency compared to the full-on Microsoft Windows OS when running .exe files. Thus Huawei might want to wait to see how things plan out before investing too heavily in the new ecosystem.

In early 2019, CHUWI launched a 2-in-1 tablet UBook on Kickstarter, which had raised more than 450,000 dollars. Recently, CHUWI upgrade the configuration of UBook and relaunch it this month.
Upgraded to Intel N4100, more powerful and smooth
Upgraded from the previous Intel 6Y30 to the Intel N4100, the processor features quad-core and four threads, the highest frequency reaches up to 2.4 GHz. In addition to upgraded performance, the processor of Intel N4100 has low power consumption, which can work smoothly and efficiently.
For the graphics processing, UBook is upgraded from the Intel UHD 515 to Intel UHD 600, which can decode 4K video easily.
eMMC→SSD, faster than ever
For the storage, UBook has upgraded from the previous eMMC to large 256GB SSD, which is faster in reading and writing. With the storage combination of 8GB LPDDR4+256GB SSD, UBook is more efficient in dealing with multiple tasks.
Compared with the popular tablet Surface Go, UBook is more cost-efficient.
Storage
At similar price, compared with UBook 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space,  Surface Go has only 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space, which is poorer not only in the speed of reading and writing but also in the storage.
Interface expansion
UBook has the interface of versatile USB Type-C, USB 3.0, headphone jack, DC charging, Micro HDMI and Micro SD. Various interface make it easier to charge, upload data and transmit video.
However, Surface Go only has USB-C, headphone jack and Micro SD interface. With the only USB-C interface, it is unable to charge while doing other operations. User has to buy Surface Dock which is specially designed for Surface Connect interface.
In general, the configuration of UBook has upgraded in many aspects. Not only the upgraded processor of Intel N4100 and large SSD storage, various interfaces also make it more powerful to deal with task. As the information released, the price of UBook is about $350. With decent performance and low price, UBook can be a good choice for user to buy a portable 2-in-1 tablet. More information of course available on the official website.

Pursuing a genuine full-screen design will ruin the smartphone makers. They are all investing a lot in the design of such screens. Also, they want the phone display to get larger and larger. In other niches, it’s called Gigantomania. In this sense, China-based smartphone markets have been on everyone’s lips. First, Xiaomi released its original MIX series handset. Later the market hosted devices with bangs, a drop screen design, and a punch-hole screen design. But this is not all. Some companies like Nubia released dual-screen handsets. Thus year, two tech giants introduced their folding screen smartphones. But Xiaomi will always stand out. Not that long ago, it showcased a concept phone, the Mi MIX Alpha. It takes the full-screen concept a step higher in comparison to the previous-gen Mi MIX 3 with sliding screen design. But the latter may return in face of another Xiaomi smartphone.
Recently, tigermobiles released a new Xiaomi smartphone design patent. As the photos show, the phone uses a quad-camera module and a sliding display design to expand the screen area.
Interestingly, Xiaomi applied for a design patent to the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China as early as August 28, 2018. But this patent was officially announced on December 6, 2019.
From the sketches published by CNIPA and the sketches designed by tigermobiles, we can see that this phone uses a front dual-camera design. The left side of the phone has a large frame. And the other three sides look narrower. The back of the phone also uses a dual-camera design.
The difference is that this phone can be rolled sideways to get a bigger screen. In order to increase the screen display area, many smartphone manufacturers choose two design methods: foldable screen and surround screen. In this sense, the sliding screen is a new design.

While the Huawei P40 series is expected to come in March of next year, the upcoming smartphone lineup could actually see the light of day earlier than that. The latest speculations do indeed suggest the P40 could launch at the CES in January or at MWC in February. That said, as it always happens, details about the handsets precede their launch date; thus let’s have a look at the first alleged render of the Huawei P40 series.
As we can see in the image above, the smartphone appears to feature a curved display; very similar to the one we find on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, although less prominent. Meanwhile in the upper part of the render, we can clearly see a large camera bump that most likely encases a total of four cameras.
Finally, as far as the side buttons are concerned, we find the typical volume rocker – power on / off configuration on the right side of the handset.
Specs wise, the Huawei P40 is expected to pack a Huawei Kirin 990 5G SoC. The successor of this CPU – the Kirin 1020 – is indeed launching in September of 2020; just in time to get equipped on the Huawei Mate 40 series.
According to rumors, the P40 series will also adopt a large 6.57-inch AMOLED screen with dual punch-hole design; which will feature 2K+ resolution and support HDR content.
In the camera department, albeit we just said the bump will probably contain four sensors, there’s still a chance Huawei will add a fifth sensor beside the four. That’s due to the presence of four sensors on the P30 series and the “need” for an upgrade.

The day has come when India customers will finally be able to purchase the Vivo V17. Back in the Summer, we saw the birth of Vivo V17 Neo, followed by Vivo V17 Pro in September. Back in the last month, the company released the V17 in Russia, but it’s a different smartphone with a diamond-shaped camera design. Now, we have an L-shaped camera handset with the same V17 moniker.
Despite the obvious differences in design, the V17 has the same Snapdragon 675 SoC coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The L-shaped camera comprises four shooters. The main one is a 48MP module that comes along with an 8MP ultra-wide angle module. Completing the camera package we have a 2MP depth sensor with another 2MP camera for macro shots.
Vivo V17 boasts a 6.55-inch OLED panel with a punch-hole design serving as a house for the 32MP f/2.0 front-facing sensor. The display has a FullHD+ resolution and slim bezels. The handset draws power from a 4,500mAh battery that charges with 18W fast-charging. The software department is run by Android 9 Pie which has FunTouch 9.2 running atop.
Indian customers can opt between the Glacier Ice White or Midnight Black color variants. The new mid-range device retails for INR22,990 (~$325/€290). The handset will be available for purchase through Vivo’s official website, but should also reach other online stores in the coming days.

Not that long ago, the mobile devices market recognized only one king – Nokia. But the emergence of smartphones helped HTC dethrone the Finnish brand. However, the glory of this Taiwanese manufacturer didn’t last long. Now the mobile world leaders are Samsung and Apple. But the Chinese smartphone maker companies are breathing down the neck of these two. Huawei has been in the third position for a couple of years. And in some quarters, it even surpasses the Cupertino-based company. But what about other China-based brands? When asking this question, most of you will think of Xiaomi. Today, the special conference held in Japan, the manufacturer official uncovered that Xiaomi is the world’s fourth smartphone maker.
It turns out this manufacturer has deployed operations in more than 90 countries and regions around the world. But what’s interesting, in 42 countries and regions, Xiaomi has achieved good results, landing in the top five. This simply means, in almost half of the markets, Xiaomi is among the leaders. Thus, the recognition rate of this brand is quite high.

But if Xiaomi’s performance is the smartphone market is expected, many are not aware of the myriads of products this company is launching. Say, Xiaomi has currently deployed more than 2,000 ecosystems and consumer IoT devices. Due to this, it has become one of the world’s largest consumer IoT platforms, with a total of 213.2 million IoT access devices.
Finally, Xiaomi also emphasized that hardware profits will be guaranteed to not exceed 5% in all markets.

Vivo’s vice president and general manager for the Chinese market, Liu Hong, just revealed some details about the upcoming Vivo X30 series at the Dongguan media communication meeting that took place in China today.
Liu Hong confirmed once again that Vivo’s X30 series will debut with the new Exynos 980; an “AI chip” jointly developed by Vivo and Samsung.
According to official reports, the Exynos 980 is the world ’s first mass-produced Cortex A77 architecture dual-mode 5G SoC. With more than 500 engineers employed in R&D by the Chinese phone maker. Additionally, the joint research and development time between the two companies has been of nearly 10 months; thus why the X30 series will be the first to equip the CPU.
Liu Hong also revealed that the Vivo X30 series is already being mass-produced; with a daily output close to 100,000 units. The X30 5G will be Vivo’s first dual-mode 5G phone and it will debut in the Chinese province Guilin on December 16th.
Samsung’s Exynos 980 CPU isn’t the only interesting piece of hardware we’ll find on the X30 series though. The smartphone will indeed also pack a periscope super telephoto lens, which supports up to 60x super zoom; plus we’ll find another dedicated portrait lens.
Finally, it’s worth reminding that the vivo X30 series will use a small-aperture punch-hole screen solution and will support under display fingerprint recognition. This is the first time that the X series adopts this type full-screen design, a trend that’s apparently getting more common.
Either way, in exactly a week we’ll learn more about the latest Vivo flagship; most importantly its retail price.

On December 6th, Nokia finally announced the much teased Nokia 2.3 entry-level phone. Today, the device went on pre-order in Russia with a price tag of 7990 Rubles, around $125 or 113€ at the current exchange rates.
As we can see on Nokia’s Russian official website, the Nokia 2.3 is available in all the color variants announced at lunch. Thus it’s possible to pick between Cyan Green, Sand and Charcoal. That said, the website does not show when the devices will actually be shipped. So, if you’re from Russia, you can probably wait a little longer before pre-ordering one.
Specs wise, the Nokia 2.3 comes with a 6.2-inch HD + 19: 9 screen; along with a waterdrop notch and In-Cell technology to improve the viewing experience. The smartphone is then powered by a low-end MediaTek Helio A22 CPU along with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD card).
While on the photography side, the handset features a 13MP main rear camera with LED flash and f/2.2 aperture paired with 2MP secondary camera. On the front we instead find a single 5MP front-facing camera with f/2.4 aperture.
Finally, Nokia’s 2.3 is powered by a 4000mAh capacity battery and runs Android 9.0 OTB (upgradable to Android 10).

WhatsApp has changed the way we communicate with each other. Nowadays, it would be very complicated to carry out the daily activities of our life without the messaging applications. Groups of friends, work chats, favorite contacts …
On this occasion, we want to talk about one of the novelties that a lot of users had been asking for in the last months. Yes, call waiting is already a reality with the latest WhatsApp update for Android. From now on we can put on hold the calls we receive through the app. Although this system has some limitations. We tell you all the details below.
WhatsApp calls are a very useful feature. From the messaging app, you can call any of the contacts for free with the mere fact of pressing a button. Everything works through the Internet, so phone carriers have nothing to do with these types of procedures. However, if someone called us at the same time we made a call. We could not find out until we hung up.
With the latest version for Android (v2.19.352) everything changes since WhatsApp have decided to include calls on hold. From now on, when someone calls us while we are making a call, the notification appears in real-time. A system similar to the one we can see in traditional calls that has two options: Reject or End and accept.
As can be seen in the screenshots, this system does not perform the functions that we all know as “call waiting”. It is clear that you cannot pause a call to carry out the next one and then return to the previous call. But at least we can know at the moment if the incoming call is more important than the one we are making.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Maps Incognito mode comes to iOS, Android adding bulk Timeline delete</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In recent months, Google has added a number of privacy controlling features to Maps. The latest sees Incognito mode come to Google Maps for iOS, while Android picks up the ability to bulk delete logged locations in Timeline.
Originally debuting in Google Chrome, Incognito mode is high-profile branding that’s easily recognizable. In Maps, places you search for and navigate to won’t be saved to your Google Account with Location History not seeing any updates.
Additionally, personalized features like saved locations in Maps and restaurant recommendations will not appear. You’ll essentially be using Google Maps as if you’re temporarily signed out of your account.
Google Maps Incognito mode for iOS can be accessed by tapping your profile avatar in the top-right corner of the screen. A dialog will provide a summary of what’s changing on initial usage, and it’s rolling out starting today. The Android feature became widely available last month.
Meanwhile, the Timeline that displays your Location History in a concise view is getting bulk deletion next month on Android. This builds on the ability to auto-delete data older than three or 18 months.
With the introducing of these tools, Google today is also laying out the case for why location data is useful. In Maps, it powers aggregated wait times and the crowdedness graph, parking indicators, time-to-leave notifications, the Your match score, and the Explore tab.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: Tech21’s ‘Made for Google’ Pixel 4 accessories are a bit of a mixed bag</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you picked up a Pixel 4 over the holiday sales and you’re looking for a case to go with it, products with the “Made for Google” badge are a great place to start. Tech21 is one of the biggest names in that collection, and over the past couple of weeks I’ve spent some time with the company’s Pixel 4 XL accessories.
First and foremost, there’s Tech21’s signature case, the Evo Check. This somewhat thick plastic case is grippy, comfortable, and most importantly very protective. The case is rated for a 12-foot drop with a thick border around the sides of the phone, full protection along the back, and a raised lip to help protect the screen. The entire case is antimicrobial, too, which means it will stay much cleaner than other cases.
In testing out the Evo Check for Pixel 4 XL, I found that it’s still a pretty sweet case. The buttons feel solid and the cutouts for the speaker and USB-C port are pretty much perfect. The camera cutout on the back is a little off, though. So far, only Google’s Fabric case has been perfect for me.
Perhaps the biggest benefit to Tech21’s Evo Check for Pixel 4 is that it comes in multiple colors and with customizable buttons. I spent my time with the bright “Could by Coral” version — although, in hindsight, “Indigo” would have looked way better with my white Pixel — and it shipped with coral, yellow, and blue buttons. I swapped out the coral for the blue. The process of removing the buttons is a pain, but it’s great that you get the option.
Evo Check costs $39.99, which isn’t cheap, but it’s a great case overall that I wouldn’t regret spending the money on.
My favorite of the two cases from Tech21 was the Studio Colour. I picked up the “Let Off Steam” version of this case, which is a slightly blue shade of gray. It’s basic but unique. As a side note to Tech21, I need that “Life on Mars” color found on the iPhone’s version of the case on Pixel immediately.
The Studio Colour caught my eye primarily because it’s not made from plastic like most cases are. Instead, Tech21 uses plant-based materials to craft this Pixel 4 case. This results in buttons that are a bit stiff, but the overall case feels uncompromised from the material choice. Cutouts are mostly perfect, aside from the camera which, again, is a bit off.
The slim design of the Studio Colour also felt great. The case itself is a bit stiff, which makes the overall thin profile feel safer and less prone to any damage.
Studio Colour costs $29, and it’s well worth the money if you like the colors it offers.
Screen protectors are, in my opinion, a necessary evil. They’re almost always worse-feeling or looking than the glass on your phone, but I’d rather deal with that than shell out for a screen repair or a new phone entirely.
Tech21’s Impact Shield screen protector looks good at first glance online, but I can’t stress enough that you should not spend your money on this product.
The Impact Shield is a plastic screen protector which the company says is scratch-resistant, self-healing, and “easy to apply.” Those first two points may be true — I frankly couldn’t use the product long enough to test — but even if so, they’re overshadowed by a plethora of negatives.
Most importantly, this screen protector doesn’t actually cover the entire display. It only goes up to the top bezel, leaving a good portion of the glass completely uncovered. This is something you can’t know for sure based on the company’slistings.
The screen protector itself also seems to have absolutely no oleophobic coating, which means smudges appear almost instantly and are hard to get off.
The installation process may be the most flawed portion of this product, though. Tech21’s packaging makes the instructions a bit hard to find, and you won’t find any dust removal stickers or wet wipes to help clean off the display. The included microfiber cloth also left my display with more dust attached than before I wiped it down.
The plastic installation guide piece also leaves far too much room for error, which left me with a misaligned screen protector. Part of that alignment is definitely on my own user error, but the guide piece is far worse than similar installation methods I’ve used for similar screen protectors.
I could go on a bit more about what’s wrong with the Impact Shield, but I think I’ve made my point. You should not buy this screen protector, especially for $29. There are way better options out there for much less money.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ARCore phones can now detect depth with a single camera</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ARCore is Google’s platform for augmented reality available to Android and iOS apps. To allow for more immersive experiences, a new ARCore Depth API allows any compatible phone to create depth maps from a single camera.
One principle that makes AR more realistic is occlusion, or the “ability for digital objects to accurately appear in front of or behind real-world objects.” It lets applications make sure objects are not just floating in space or placed in a physically impossible position. This is particularly useful for making apps that let you demo furniture in your living room more realistic.
The example below is an updated version of AR animals in Google Search. The cat — with its hind legs hidden — appears behind the furniture instead of just standing in front of wherever you point the camera. It’s treating the background as being 3D with depth, not just as a flat surface. This more realistic experience will begin rolling out to some of the 200 million ARCore-enabled Android devices with the Google app today.
“Having a 3D understanding of the world” makes possible a number of other use cases. Google has explored (examples below) realistic physics, path planning, and surface interaction with ARCore’s new depth capability.
This one lens approach lowers the barrier to the technology by not requiring specialized cameras and sensors. That said, the Depth API will only improve with better hardware in phones. Google is letting developers collaborate on the new ARCore Depth API today.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Play Movies may soon add support for Dolby Vision HDR content</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Play Movies is a fine way to buy and watch digital movies, but it’s long lacked support for Dolby Vision HDR. According to some code behind the scenes, it looks like that may be coming down the road.
The folks at XDA-Developers dug into Google Play Movies v4.17.22 which has some revealing strings hidden within. According to the strings, Google Play Movies may soon support Dolby Vision content to some extent, but there’s not much information available here.
If Play Movies were to add support for Dolby’s proprietary format, it would arrive in addition to HDR10, which has been available for some time now. Dolby Vision typically offers a bit higher peak brightness from the picture with a bit more dynamic range, too. Of course, you’ll have to have a compatible TV or set-top box to take advantage of the format. Nvidia’s new Shield TV, for example, supports Dolby Vision HDR.
It’s totally unclear when Google plans to make this support available to Play Movies owners, but it’s probably a safe bet that compatible movies will be upgraded for free.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Fit is a pretty basic health/fitness suite, but it’s more than enough for many users. If you happen to own a Withings fitness watch, the latest update for the app is bringing support for syncing your sleep data with Google Fit.
The latest app update from Withings which is now available on Google Play (via Android Police) brings along with it a handful of upgrades. One of those is support for a dark theme in the app which comes alongside better overall support for Android 10. And, yes, it supports the system-wide toggle too.
More importantly, though, this update is also bringing support for Withings users to export their sleep data to Google Fit. This is in addition to Fit support for activity, daily steps, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure too. Withings is also enabling Strava integration with this update as well.
The full changelog for the update is available below and the Withings Health Mate app is on Google Play.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you have multiple calendars on your Google Calendar app on your phone, then you’ll know the pain of not being able to move events between calendars.
Not having to head to the web to move items between your work and personal calendars on Google Calendar might be a huge deal to some of you out there, especially if you’re getting notifications for items of no personal significance on a regular basis.
The feature appears to be rolling out now, with Google flipping the switch via a server-side update (via Android Police). It definitely saves some time, as until now, you would have to duplicate calendar events, then delete when you’d replicated them in your alternate calendar account.
Once the functionality reaches your Google Calendar app, you will be able to move events, thanks to a new option that will appear below the appointment title. Tapping will let you move it to any account currently signed in on your device.
Associated Press notes that you can force the new feature by stopping the app from running, and then clearing the app cache — although this is no guarantee that you’ll see it on your device. I’ve not been able to replicate it on my own Pixel 4 XL or Pixel 3a XL via this method.
It’s also worth noting that the Google Calendar move events feature seems to be enabled via a server-side update, so grabbing the most recent build of the app may not help. However, if you have noticed it on your device, let us know which build version you have down in the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Update: More countries] Google is sending out 20% Google Store discount codes to Local Guides in the UK</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Local Guides program is a great way for Google to encourage people to contribute to Google Maps with reviews, photos, and more. As a thank you, some Local Guide contributors are now receiving 20% discount codes for purchases made on the Google Store right in time for the holidays.
Emails are now heading out to those that have made contributions throughout 2019. It’s not clear just what is required to get the discount codes but the email notes “recent contributions” being a determining factor. There are some other Local Guides over on Reddit stating that they too received the email coupon, but without further details.
[Update]: It appears that the coupons are not just limited to Local Guides based in the UK, with more report coming in from Germany (via @vermutlichJ) and Spain (via @naitsirctr). We’re hoping to see more Local Guides get the coupon globally.
Having received the email, I can confirm that I am a Level 6 Local Guide but as an irregular contributor, it’s not clear what I’ve done to receive the discount code for the Google Store. However, it’s a nice little bonus for those of us in the UK that don’t necessarily get the best deals over the Black Friday-Cyber Monday weekend.
The only downside is that these discount codes can’t be used to knock money off the price of a new Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Google Stadia plan, or Nest Aware subscription. That’s a little disappointing but you can still save money on all other products on the store, including Nest WiFi, Nest Hub Max, and more.
All Local Guides discount codes are set to expire on December 13, so you’ll need to be quick if you were thinking of making a purchase ahead of the holiday rush. If you too received the same email, let us know in the comment section down below. Unfortunately, the coupons look as though they are only being sent out to UK Local Guides right now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alleged Samsung Galaxy S11 leaks in especially grainy hands-on images</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The very first hands-on image leak of the alleged Galaxy S11 has now surfaced, although you would be hard-pressed to work out just what you’re looking at given the quality of the leaked images.
Despite that, the upcoming flagship is visible even in a supposed ‘leakproof case’ due to that quite distinctive new camera layout that was showcased previously in CAD-based renders. Given the track record of leaker @IceUniverse, it’s highly likely that these grainy images are the real deal — albeit not exactly in the quality we had hoped.
It’s that interesting new camera layout that sort-of seals the deal, as there are no other devices that we know of coming with the domino rear camera layout.
It’s believed that the Galaxy S11 camera system could have some serious fire-power, with a 108-megapixel main sensor, impressive 5x zoom capabilities and may even be able to record video at a staggering 8K — thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 965 chipset. The rest of the specifications will no doubt entice, with a potential 5,000mAh battery also being added into the mix according to the same reports.
Beyond the camera array, there isn’t much else to glean from the pixelated hands-on images shared here. Along the top bezel, there appear to be some cutouts in the case, which could be for a SIM tray and some other microphones but, honestly, we’re just speculating at this point as no further details were given.
It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to expect more Galaxy S11 hands-on image leaks over the coming weeks, as is often the case, this could be the opening of Pandora’s box ahead of a deluge of new information. Given the quality, what do you hope for with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S11 in early 2020? Let us know down in the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Update: Now live] Google Opinion Rewards set to warn you when Play Store credits are expiring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Opinion Rewards app really is a great little way to receive free Play Store credits to go toward apps, games, music, and movies just for answering some simple surveys and questionnaires.
However, while the credits gifted by the Google Opinion Rewards app can be accumulated quite substantially, these credits expire one year after initially awarded. The biggest problem is that you get no formal warning of when your credit is set to disappear.
[Update 12/09]: Google is now rolling out the expiration dates for any previously earned credits within the Google Opinion Rewards app (via Android Police). The update seems to be server-side, meaning that it should be heading out over the coming days.
When you now fire up the Google Opinion Rewards app, you’ll see exactly when a specific portion of your credit is set to run out. As you’ll notice from the screenshot below, it’s nice and prominent, ensuring that you know just when you have to spend that specific allotted portion of your Play Store credit balance.
It’s also worth noting that the ‘Reward history’ section still doesn’t show individual expiry dates for your credit balance — which is still disappointing. At least it’s better than just seeing your Opinion Rewards balance dissipate without any warning.
 
According to posts on Reddit, some people have been receiving notifications to check their Opinion Rewards credit balance (via XDA-Developers). The original poster notes that they saw a quite substantial $63 disappear from their credit balance, which is especially strange, given that it would be almost impossible to earn an amount that large in just one day of answering surveys.
 
Google seems to be showing a message with a link to help center pages when you load up the Opinion Rewards app. The help center pages explain that Google is currently working on updates to help notify you when your credits are set to expire.
There is even an explanation for the major drop seen by posters over on Reddit. This appears to be because of bulk expiration of older Google Play Store credits. That still doesn’t explain why credit accumulation would reach those levels before being taken away.
You can view your current promotional credit balance within your Google Play Store wallet along with the expiration date underneath. It’s as easy as heading into the Play Store and selecting “Payment methods” from the side hamburger menu. Within the original Reddit post, several commenters are seeing the expiry date shift back when they make a purchase with their promotional balance.
Some are even stating that separately purchased gift card balances are disappearing — which is quite shocking. We’re sure that some clarification will come from Google regarding these balances in the coming days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[Update: Now available] OnePlus TV update brings Netflix along w/ further fixes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The OnePlus TV is now receiving an update that will bring Netflix support among a host of other fixes for the India-only smart TV.
While we wait to see if OnePlus will bring their first non-smartphone hardware to other global markets, the addition of arguably the most popular streaming platform is a major deal. Netflix support was notably absent when the OnePlus TV was launched alongside the OnePlus 7T earlier this year.
[Update 12/09]: The ‘Netflix update’ for the OnePlus TV is now heading out after initially being pulled. The update has been confirmed over on the official OnePlus Forums, with essentially the same changelog but a new build number.
This updated build now comes as V1.8.0T1911211115 for the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro, it’s not entirely clear why the first update was pulled but OnePlus has been swift to correct any problems and now you can update your Android TV set and enjoy Netflix plus some more fixes and tweaks.
OnePlus has stated that this update will be incremental, so it will head out to a small subset of owners today, before a wider rollout over the coming days — so don’t worry too much if you don’t get the OTA update right away.
[Update]: It appears that the update has been pulled after the original blog post has been removed from the OnePlus Forums. It’s not clear why this is the case but we’ve reached out to OnePlus for a comment to find out why this is the case and if the rollout will startup again soon.
OnePlus did confirm that the streaming service would eventually come to their first TV set shortly after launch but we were left in the dark as to when it would actually arrive. In a blog post over on the official OnePlus forums, OnePlus TV Sofware PM, Steven X. confirmed that this second OTA update was finally adding Netflix after months of waiting.
This OTA update will bump the OnePlus TV to V1.6.0T1911211115 and includes a number of other optimizations for the TV beyond just adding Netflix. You can see the full changelog below.
OnePlus TV V1.6.0T1911211115 system update changelog
The update is set to have an incremental rollout, so those of you that are lucky enough to own the OnePlus TV, you may not see Netflix on your smart TV for a few days until the OTA file has fully rolled out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Galaxy S10: Everything you need to know!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Every year, Samsung kicks off the year with its Galaxy S devices. These serve as a showcase of the very best that the company has to offer, and this year, we were treated to a total of three new devices with the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e.
Whether you're looking for the latest news, want to know how the phones compare to other gadgets, need help finding a good case, or anything else in between, you're in the right place.
The Galaxy S10+ is a big, powerful, and expensive phone that we cannot get enough of.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
Samsung's S10+ has a phenomenal display, a great triple-camera setup, genuinely good software, and the best specs you can find in a modern 2019 flagship.
You'll pay a pretty price to own Samsung's best, but it's the best for a reason.
Samsung typically releases two Galaxy S phones each year, including its base model and a Plus one with slightly improved specs and a larger screen.
For 2019, we have the base Galaxy S10, the upgraded Galaxy S10+, and a completely new entry with the Galaxy S10e.
While the S10 and S10+ are being marketed as Samsung's two main flagships for the year, the S10e is a device that aims to offer a lot of that same experience but for less money (think of it as Samsung's answer to the iPhone XR).
This is a big change to the usual Galaxy S lineup, and while it could cause for some confusion, it gives customers more choice than before. If you want the best that Samsung has to offer, you get the S10. Want a larger screen, a bigger battery, and two front-facing cameras? The S10+ has you covered. If money's a bit tighter but you still want an excellent Android phone, the S10e is ready to serve you.
Samsung's been making really great phones for the last few years, so if you already own an older Galaxy S flagship, is it worth upgrading to the new S10?
If you're still rocking a Galaxy S8 or anything older, getting the S10 just makes sense. It'll be a vastly better experience compared to what you're using right now, and if you've held onto your current phone for two or more years, you've definitely gotten your money's worth.
And honestly, even if you have last year's Galaxy S9, the S10 still delivers meaningful improvements on a few different areas that could make it worth splurging for.
The Galaxy S10 series gets a lot right. The phones are built well, have gorgeous screens, and incredible processing power.
So, how does all of that stack up against other smartphones that are on the market? We've taken the time to compare the S10, S10+, and S10e to some of their closest competitors, making it easy for you to choose the device that's right for you.
With three different phones being offered this year, that means you have three different spec sheets to familiarize yourself with this year.
The S10 sits in the middle-ground, the S10+ has the very best specs you can find, and the S10e cuts a few corners to get its price down to where it is.
It's a pretty simple way to think about things, but if you really want to understand the minute similarities and differences between the three phones, we recommend checking out the full spec list below 👇.
Galaxy S10 Specifications: S10, S10+, S10e, S10 5G specs in one place
Yep. The rumors were right. Despite its resilience to the notch over the last couple of years, Samsung caved in with the S10 series by using its Infinity-O display that features a hole-punch cutout/notch in the upper-right corner.
While there are a lot of mixed feelings about this decision, we're glad Samsung made this move.
For starters, this allows for even more screen real-estate than before. The top and bottom bezels have shrunk quite a bit compared to the S9, giving you even more viewing area for your movies, games, etc.
As for the displays themselves, they're still rocking Samsung's phenomenal Super AMOLED panels. This year, however, they get a nice upgrade with official support for HDR10+. In other words, if you're watching a video that supports HDR10+, you'll see it with even punchier colors and deeper contrasts.
What is HDR10+ and why does it make the Galaxy S10 screen better?
Speaking of the display, the S10 and S10+ have their fingerprint sensors hidden underneath it.
Similar to what we've seen on devices like the OnePlus 6T, there's a designated area in the bottom middle of the screen where you can place your finger to unlock the phone. The S10 and S10+ are the first devices to use Qualcomm's ultrasonic sensing technology which essentially creates a 3D model of your fingerprint. Compared to other in-screen sensors that just capture a 2D image of it, this should allow the S10 to be faster and more secure in these regards.
You know how we've been saying that Samsung has three S10 models to choose from? Yeah, there's a fourth one, too.
The Galaxy S10 5G, in addition to connecting to 5G networks, has a gigantic 6.7-inch display, 4,500 mAh battery, and 25W Super Fast Charging.
If you're interested in picking up the S10 5G, it's currently available at Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile in the United States. AT&T technically sells the phone, too, but it's only available for business customers and not regular consumers.
The S10 5G is easily the most expensive phone in the lineup, coming in at a hefty $1300. It does have some nice benefits over the S10+, but we aren't convinced that it's worth the steep price tag — especially when you consider how scattered 5G availability currently is in the U.S.
However, if you live in a supported market and want to be among the first in the country to tap into the next generation of wireless data, the S10 5G is probably your best bet.
The Galaxy S10 devices are designed incredibly well, and to compliment that craftsmanship that went into them, Samsung's offering the phones in a variety of gorgeous colors.
What kind of colors?
The S10, S10+, and S10e are all available in Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Flamingo Pink, and Prism Green. The S10+ has two premium Ceramic Black and Ceramic White finishes, whereas the S10e gets a gorgeous Canary Yellow colorway.
Which color Galaxy S10 should I buy?
Samsung has an extensive retail network for its flagship phones, and that means you don't have to look hard to find a place where you can buy any of the new Galaxy S10s. The Galaxy S10e starts at $750, the Galaxy S10 is at $900, and the Galaxy S10+ is $1000. You can add $100-200 to each to add more internal storage, or in the case of the S10+ an exclusive ceramic back.

If you do plan on buying any version of the S10, do yourself a favor and also make sure that you grab a few accessories to go along with it.
Cases and screen protectors can go a long way in ensuring how well your phone holds up over time, so do the right thing and spend a few extra dollars now to protect yourself from ending up with a broken and shattered device a few months down the road.
In an unexpected move for the company, there's been a lot of talk and chatter about Samsung getting ready to release a Galaxy S10 Lite before 2019 is over.
Rumored specs for the S10 Lite include a 6.7-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display, three rear cameras, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 processor. It's also said that the phone will have 8GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, and a large 4,500 mAh battery that can take advantage of Samsung's 45W wired charging speeds.
Samsung may hold an event sometime in December to formally unveil the phone, and as we learn more, we'll be sure to let you know.
The Galaxy S10 continues to be a top-tier Android flagship even at this stage in its life cycle, but there's no ignoring the fact that the Galaxy S11 will be here before you know it.
We're expecting Samsung to launch three models of the S11, including an S11, S11+, and S11e similar to what we saw with the S10 series. Big camera improvements should be the highlight this time around, with the rumor mill pointing towards a 108MP primary camera sensor, impressive low-light performance, 8K video cature at 30 frames-per-second, and a lot more.
The S11 series is said to make its debut sometime in mid or late February 2020, meaning we don't have too much longer to wait to see what's up Samsung's sleeves.
The Galaxy S10 offers a lot of big improvements over the S9, and thanks to new data from Counterpoint Research, it looks like Samsung's upgrades for the S10 series really paid off.
According to Counterpoint:
Of the three phones Samsung released (the S10, S10+, and S10e), the S10+ accounts for "50% of volumes of the series." Surprisingly, Counterpoint says that the Galaxy S10e is the weakest-selling of the three.
Despite the S10e being the worst selling of the trio, it's actually the reason Samsung saw an increase in sales compared to last year.
Sprint has rolled out the latest security patch to the Galaxy S10 series, which includes fixes for LTE reception issues. Galaxy S10 users on Sprint have been complaining about poor reception, and while the carrier rolled out a fix last month, it didn't remedy the problem. The latest update should provide a better solution for those still affected by weak cellular reception.
The update comes in at 184MB, and is now available for those on Sprint's Galaxy S10e, S10, and S10+.
An update is currently rolling out for improvements to the fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S10. The release notes do not go into much specifics about the update, other than it is for the biometrics and fingerprints in particular. It could possibly be in response to the user who was able to bypass the fingerprint sensor with a 3D print, or maybe it is just to improve performance.
Initial response has been positive with several users reporting that it does indeed increase the speed of the sensor. However, we've not been able to test it for ourselves yet.
If you're away from Wi-Fi and looking to update then don't worry as the update is a rather small one weighting in at only 6.9MB. If you've not received the update already, then be patient, as it often takes time to roll out, specifically for unlocked users.
Earlier this month, reliable tipster Evan Blass shared that the Galaxy S10 5G would be released on Verizon on May 16. A Bloomberg report a day later further reinforced this idea, and now thanks to a leaked render of the S10 5G, the May 16 date is all but confirmed.
The render comes to us via Android Headlines, and as you can see, the date on the lock screen reads, "Thu, May 16."
As a reminder, the Galaxy S10 5G has a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, four rear cameras, and is expected to cost well over $1,000.
Just yesterday, Evan Blass reported that the Galaxy S10 5G will finally hit the U.S. on May 16. According to another report from Bloomberg, pre-orders are scheduled to begin this month.
Per Bloomberg:
The expected launch date of May 16 still remains, meaning Samsung will give customers nearly a full month to get pre-orders in before the S10 5G actually ships.
According to a cryptic tweet from the ever-reliable Evan Blass, the Galaxy S10 5G will make its debut in the U.S. on May 16. The phone will launch initially on Verizon — which just started rolling out its 5G network in Chicago and Minneapolis — and will also make its way to AT&T later in the year.
We'll have to wait until the U.S. launch to find out how much the Galaxy S10 5G will cost, but the phone is going on sale from tomorrow in Samsung's home market for the equivalent of $1,125. That should provide a decent baseline to gauge how much the device will end up costing Stateside.
About a week ago, a report surfaced claiming that Samsung will launch the Galaxy S10 5G on April 5 in Korea. Now, Samsung is confirming that news.
In a press release issued on April 1 that is surprisingly not an April Fool's joke, Samsung said "the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G will be available in Korea starting April 5, 2019." Customers in the U.S. will have to wait until June to get their hands on the S10 5G through Verizon, and this will then be followed by a launch in Europe.
We don't have U.S. pricing yet, but Samsung has said that the Galaxy S10 5G starts out at 1.39 million KRW for the 256GB model and goes up to 1.56 million KRW if you get 512GB. In USD, that works out to around $1,125 and $1,375, respectively.
The cameras on the Galaxy S10 are tremendously powerful, and apparently, NBC likes them so much that it used only an S10+ to film an entire episode of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
Samsung shared a behind-the-scenes video about how the S10+ was used during the filming, and as you can see, NBC still used gimbles and professional lighting. Even so, it is pretty impressive that we've gotten to a ponit where a national television show can be recorded entirely on a smartphone.
While the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e have been available for purchase for two weeks, there's still one version of the phone that we're eagerly awaiting — the Galaxy S10 5G. Thankfully, it looks like our waiting may soon be over.
According to a report from The Korea Herald, Samsung will begin sales of the S10 5G in Korea starting on April 5. It'll be sold at "Samsung outlets and its online mall as well as at shops of mobile carriers in Korea."
Rather than having pre-orders for the phone, Samsung will instead offer promotions between April 5 and April 16 — allowing customers to get a free pair of Galaxy Buds, a wireless charger, or 50% off a future screen replacement with their purchase.
Following the launch in Korea, it's said that the Galaxy S10 5G will make its way to Verizon in the United States on April 11.
After being available for pre-order since February 21, the Samsung Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e are now all out of the pre-order stage and available for immediate purchase.
As we expected, this means that the previous pre-order bonus of getting a $130 gift certificate with your order is gone. In its place, Samsung is now offering 6 months of Spotify Premium for free.
While this is a nice promo, it's worth noting that only new Spotify Premium customers can take advantage of it. If you're currently subscribed to Premium or have done so in the past, you won't be eligible.
We all know that the Galaxy S10 is one gorgeous device, but as it turns out, that beauty comes at a cost.
iFixit recently published its full teardown of the Galaxy S10 and S10e and gave both phones a low repairability score of just 3 out of 10.
While iFixit did praise the S10 and S10e for requiring just one Philips screwdriver for removing all of the screws, it knocked both phones for having difficult battery and screen replacements.
Check out the full teardown
It's no secret that the Galaxy S10's display is one of the best around, but if you had any lingering doubts, DisplayMate's recent analysis of it should put them to rest.
In DisplayMate's review, the company said:
Furthermore, DisplayMate also went on to say that the Galaxy S10's screen is "the most color accurate display" it's ever tested.

Before the phones even officially hit store shelves, Netflix has already confirmed HDR support for the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e.
In other words, if you're watching Netflix on one of Samsung's new phones and the show is available in HDR, you'll see it with brighter, more contrasty colors for an overall better experience.
We had no reason to believe the phones wouldn't get HDR for Netflix, but it's nice to get the confirmation nonetheless.
One of the most exciting features of the Galaxy S10 and S10+ is the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that's hidden underneath their displays. We already knew that the ultrasonic tech would cause issues with third-party screen protectors, and in response to this, Samsung's confirmed that both phones ship with a Samsung-made one pre-installed out of the box.
Per a post on the Samsung Members site:
The screen protectors come with a 90-day warranty, and if it ends up getting scratched, worn, or you simply want a back-up in case something happens, you'll be able to buy additional ones for $29.99 CAD (around $20 USD).
Since pre-orders for the Galaxy S10 opened on February 21, Samsung's been offering a promotion that allows you to grab a free pair of Galaxy Buds with your purchase. As of February 27, things have changed a bit.
Citing "high interest" in Galaxy S10 pre-orders, Samsung's actually run out of Galaxy Buds supply and is now offering a $130 gift certificate when you buy the phone. The $130 credit can be used towards "select products" on Samsung.com and via the Shop Samsung app, and for some people, this may be an even more appealing deal. You can buy Galaxy Buds when they get back in stock, or put that $130 towards whatever else you want. Not too shabby.
See at Samsung
Eager to buy the Galaxy S10 for yourself? Good news — pre-orders are now live at Samsung and go through March 7. If you buy the phone before then, you'll also be able to snag a pair of Samsung's new Galaxy Buds completely free (a $130 value).
AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon are all selling the phone, too.
On top of Samsung's website and through carriers, you'll also be able to purchase the Galaxy S10 from:
Regular sales open up on March 8, and as expected, you'll be able to buy the S10 pretty much anywhere and everywhere.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Opinion Rewards adds expiration date for your credits</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in November, we covered the case of the mysteriously disappearing Google Play credits that were earned from the Google Opinion Rewards app. At that time, Google announced via an updated support page that it was working on a way to warn users when credits would expire.
While it has been Google's policy that credits expire after a year, it has never been easy to check on when exactly they will expire. The only method involved opening the Play Store app and checking your payment methods. However, this was extremely inconvenient by requiring you to open a separate app, and it only gave you a date, not the amount that would be expiring.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
Fortunately, the day has finally come, and the new feature is rolling out to the Google Opinion Rewards app. The expiration date for your credits will now be shown prominently under the total balance in the app. Not only does this make it much easier to check the expiration, but unlike the method using the Play Store, you also get to see the amount expiring.
Now, you'll no longer have to hop around between apps, or wonder just how much you're about to lose. You can use the credits you earn to pick up a new app, movie, song, or book. The only way it could get any better is if the reward history page also showed the date when each credit would expire. However, for now, let's just be happy Google finally implemented a warning at all.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pokémon could soon hide behind your couch thanks to an ARCore update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Augmented Reality, or AR, is a pretty cool concept. The idea is to use your device's camera (in this case, a smartphone) to film your surroundings and add virtual objects alongside the physical ones. Pokémon Go is likely the first real AR experience most smartphone users had, but there's always been one big issue with AR that breaks the experience — virtual objects don't really look like they're in the real world.
That all changes with today's launch of the ARCore Depth API, a development language update that allows developers to utilize a new depth map functionality within Google's ARCore. Over 200 million Android phones are compatible with this new functionality, and devices with ToF sensors on them will be able to provide dynamic occlusion, while phones without ToF sensors will only be able to occlude virtual objects behind static real-world objects.

What in the world does all that mean? Well, if you have a Galaxy Note 10, for instance, you could feasibly play AR Frogger from atop a highway bridge. The phone would be able to use that ToF sensor to detect the physical size and location of cars as they move and your virtual hopping frog could get squashed if you make the wrong move. While there's no such game quite yet, there will no longer be any technical limitations for developers who would like to make one. While phones without a ToF sensor can't use moving objects for occlusion, they can use static objects, such as couches or chairs for calculation.
To demonstrate the stark contrast between the new and old understanding of depth, two GIFs of a virtual cat are presented standing behind a chair. In the old ARCore language (above GIF, left side), the cat looks as if it belonged in an M.C. Escher painting, as its back half is in front of the chair, while its front half appears to be coming from behind it. The new ARCore Depth language (above GIF, right side) understands that a chair is actually present in the scene and includes that in the depth calculations, properly obstructing the back half of the cat, as if it were really standing on the living room floor.
It's not just good for virtual pet demonstrations, though. Some more real-world examples include the Houzz app, which lets users preview furniture and other decorations right in their own homes via their smartphones. This functionality, as a whole, isn't anything new, as brands like IKEA and Amazon have included this type of functionality for a while now. Like the cat demo, though, the difference is found in the ability to place virtual furniture in your house and see how it looks in front, alongside, and behind your existing pieces.
Google is also working with several video game developers to better integrate this technology into current and upcoming AR-enabled titles. Unity, one of the single most popular gaming engines in modern times, will be including support for Google's latest ARCore updates. Ralph Hauwert, Vice President, Platforms at Unity Technologies, had this to say:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Don't expect to see the Snapdragon 865 in many value flagships in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Snapdragon 865 is here, and it offers a host of exciting new features. The CPU design is based on the latest Cortex A77 cores, the Adreno 650 GPU offers sizable gains in performance and has updatable drivers, and the AI engine is twice as fast.
One of the more interesting changes is that there's no internal modem anymore. Qualcomm is instead offering the Snapdragon 865 with the Snapdragon X55 5G modem, and the chipset is sold as a package deal — device makers won't get the Snapdragon 865 unless they also opt for the X55 modem.
That means that if you're picking up a phone powered by the Snapdragon 865 in 2020, it will have a 5G modem with global bands. There's no 4G-only option available this time around, and that has a few consequences, particularly in the value flagship segment.
The fact that device manufacturers will have to pay for a separate modem will inevitably drive prices up. Therefore, it's unlikely we'll see the same value-focused options powered by the Snapdragon 865 next year. For context, the Redmi K20 Pro with the Snapdragon 855 launched at the equivalent of $390, and the Realme X2 Pro powered by the Snapdragon 855+ debuted at $420. With the Snapdragon 865, that just won't be possible.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
We're already seeing the effects of this change, with Xiaomi announcing that its Redmi K30 series will be powered by the Snapdragon 765 instead. The Snapdragon 765 is a mid-range chipset that debuted alongside the Snapdragon 865, but the main difference is that it has an integrated — but less capable — 5G modem. It's possible that most phones in the value category next year will feature the Snapdragon 765 in liue of the Snapdragon 865.
But the manufacturer that will be affected the most is OnePlus. Xiaomi and Realme primarily cater to buyers in the budget category, so they can offset any losses in the mid-tier space by pushing out more models in the $100 to $200 segment. But OnePlus has built its entire brand around delivering the latest hardware, and not being able to do that will put it at a significant disadvantage. Who would buy a OnePlus 8 that has the Snapdragon 765 when the $600 7T is powered by the Snapdragon 855?
OnePlus doesn't have an exhaustive portfolio of devices to fall back on, and its success is defined by its performance in the value space. It is in a tough spot, because even if it were to justify hiking the price of its devices by touting the 5G benefits of the Snapdragon 865, the feature is largely wasted in its largest market, India. 5G will not be commercially available in India for at least two to three years, putting OnePlus in a bind.
As such, it is entirely possible we'll see OnePlus roll out a mid-range phone in 2020 that's powered by the Snapdragon 765. The company already pivoted to a dual flagship cadence this year with the introduction of the OnePlus 7 Pro, and it is likely that next year's Pro variant will see a price hike that puts it closer to the likes of Samsung and Huawei's flagships.
2020 will be the year when 5G finally becomes viable in most markets, and for better or worse Qualcomm is going all-in on the next generation of cellular connectivity. It will be interesting to see how that affects the value segment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Galaxy S11: News, Leaks, Release Date, Specs, and Rumors!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung's Galaxy S series is always one of the most anticipated smartphone releases year after year. Following a modest upgrade with the S9 series, 2019's Galaxy S10 lineup shook things up with an all-new Infinity-O design for the display, triple rear cameras, and even a third "budget" model.
In the coming months, it'll be time for Samsung to take the wraps off of the Galaxy S11. The S11 has big shoes to fill, but knowing Samsung, it'll be up to the task.
Without further ado, here's everything we know about the Samsung Galaxy S11!
Samsung's 2019 flagship is still worth a look.
The Galaxy S11 is bound to be a great phone, but if you need a handset right now, the S10 is more than worth picking up at this point in 2019. It continues to have a stunning display, blazing-fast performance, and very capable triple rear cameras.
Most years, Samsung's Galaxy S lineup has consisted of two releases — the regular model and a Plus one. With the S10, however, Samsung shook things up by launching the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
Looking forward with the Galaxy S11, we're expecting Samsung to stick with that three-phone release. If the naming scheme also stays the same, that means we'll be getting the S11, S11+, and S11e.
On November 9, 2019, tipster Evan Blass shared three screen sizes for the different S11 phones — inlcuding 6.4-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.9-inch ones. It's also noted that Samsung will offer the smaller two versions of the S11 in LTE and 5G models, with the larger 6.9-inch phone (likely the S11+) having 5G support as a default feature.
In regards to the S11's design, it's shaping up to be a modest change compared to the S10. November 22 brought us the first CAD renders of the upcoming phone, showcasing the device in all of its glory.
The display once again has a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera, but this time it's centered at the top of the screen similar to what we saw on the Note 10. The edges of the screen are also curved, but it's possible Samsung will keep a flat display around for the S11e just like it did with the S10e.
Around back, Samsung changed up the rear camera housing quite a bit. Instead of a horizontal bump in the top-center of the phone, we now have a chunky vertical one towards far left side. The S11 appears to have five camera sensors, indicating that Samsung's ready to up its photography game (more on this below).
The CAD render also reinforces the 6.7-inch screen size that was previously mentioned, along with there being no 3.5mm headphone jack.
Then, on November 26, we got our first good look at the larger Galaxy S11+. It appears to share the regular S11's curved hole-punch display, but the camera hump is quite a bit larger — consisting of five individual camera sensors. It's bound to be an impressive photography tool, but there's no getting around how polarizing this design is.
Hands-on images are still pretty scarce, but on December 9, Samsung tipster @IceUniverse shared two very pixelated real-world shots of the S11.

The S11's design is mostly hidden behind a "leakproof case" in the photos, but they do allow us to get another look at the phone's large rear camera housing. Everything here seems to match up with the CAD renders, indicating that this is likely the final (or near-final) design.
Right off the bat, there are a few assumptions we can make about the S11's specs. There will be an AMOLED display, it'll be powered by Qualcomm's next-gen processor (Snapdragon 865?), and there will be at least 6GB of RAM.
In regards to S11 specs, the rumor mill has been talking nonstop about the S11's new camera. On November 4, Samsung leaker Ice Universe shared that the phone has a "high probability" of offering a 108MP camera for one of its sensors.
Samsung officially unveiled its 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX camera sensor in August, and it only makes sense for the company to debut this on its first big flagship of the year.
The Galaxy S11 is also said to support 5x optical zoom, along with being one of the first smartphones to support 8K video capture at 30 frames-per-second. A report from November 29 mentioned a "Bright Night Sensor" that should allow for impressive low-light photography.
As for the S11's display, we should see a big upgrade for it, too. Samsung's One UI 2 Beta included a settings page for a 120Hz display — something we've yet to see on any Samsung phone. While it's possible Samsung's holding this off for the Note 11, it seems more likely that the company would want to debut this feature on the S11.
On the software side of things, SamMobile has reported that the Galaxy S11 will ship with Android 10 and One UI 2.1 out of the box.
Next, let's talk about everyone's favorite subject — price.
For comparison's sake, here's the retail pricing of the S10 series:
Phones tend to get more expensive with each year that passes, and that'll probably be the case for the S11 series.
The severity of those potential price increases remains unclear, but expect next year's handsets to be more expensive in some capacity. With the Note 10+ having a starting price of $1100, Samsung's made it evident that it's perfectly comfortable with $1000+ price tags.
For the last two years, Samsung's announced its Galaxy S phones in late February right before MWC. The Galaxy S10 was revealed on February 20, and the S9 had its unveiling on February 25.
With no reason to believe that Samsung is changing anything for the S11, it's safe to say we'll once again get a February announcement with pre-orders opening up shortly after. This was also confirmed by Evan Blass, with him indicating that we'll see the "traditional mid-to-late February launch."
Samsung sent out invites for the S10 Unpacked event a month prior in January, and that'll also probably be the case with the S11.
While it's fun to get excited about what the Galaxy S11 will have to offer, that doesn't mean you should already be counting out the Galaxy S10.
The S10 is still one of the best Android phones that money can buy, and now that it's been out in the wild for a few months, it isn't uncommon to find some pretty sweet deals for it.
You can certainly wait a few more months and hold out for the S11 if you prefer, but if you're in the market for a new phone right now, we absolutely still recommend picking up the S10.
Samsung's 2019 flagship is still worth a look.
The Galaxy S11 is bound to be a great phone, but if you need a handset right now, the S10 is more than worth picking up at this point in 2019. It continues to have a stunning display, blazing-fast performance, and very capable triple rear cameras.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to fix common Chromecast issues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Chromecast is hands down my favorite tech innovation of the past decade. It's one of the most affordable products you can buy that lets you easily stream media from your phone to your TV — as long as your Chromecast is set up and functioning properly. We've rounded up the best solutions for common Chromecast issues that you or a family member might be struggling with.
The most common issue to run into using a Chromecast is shoddy stream quality or an inconsistent connection with your home network that hampers your ability to stream media. Every Chromecast after the first generation supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz network frequencies, with the latter offering the fastest connection, although with a shorter range. The most obvious and frequently suggested solution to improve network connectivity is to bring your Chromecast and router closer together to ensure it gets a stronger and more stable signal.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
If that's not possible or just not worth the hassle given your home's configuration, then read on for more tips.
One sure-fire way to fix many issues with a malfunctioning Chromecast is to give it a good ol' factory reset.
Every Chromecast — whether you own the legacy stick design, a second- or third-generation Chromecast, or the 4K-enabled Chromecast Ultra — feature a physical factory reset button located somewhere near the power port. The steps for factory resetting a Chromecast are the same no matter which version you own.
Once you've reset your Chromecast, you'll need to go through the setup steps again using the Google Home app.
If the factory reset didn't work and you're still having connectivity issues, it could be an issue with your home Wi-Fi network. In that case, the next troubleshooting step would be to power-cycle your modem and/or wireless router. It's safe to assume that everyone knows how to power-cycle a router, but just in case you've never had an issue with your home internet before, here are the steps which you shall now burn into your memory forever:
Once your Wi-Fi is back up and running, try setting up and streaming to your Chromecast to see if that has fixed the issue.
Most TVs these days come with a USB port located somewhere near the HDMI inputs on the back, so it might seem quite logical and elegant to just plug into that USB port and use the TV as a power source for your Chromecast.
Now, this setup could work just fine, depending on the make and brand of TV you own, but it's not the most reliable option and can cause many issues, like having your Chromecast randomly shut down due to inconsistent power output. Also, every time you turn off your TV, your Chromecast will shut down, meaning it will also need to constantly reboot itself each time you power on your TV, which can sometimes take a few minutes and is less than ideal.
That's why Google always recommends using the USB cable and power supply that came with your Chromecast and plugs it into a nearby outlet or power bar. Sure, it might add to the nest of cables behind your entertainment center, but it's the most reliable way to ensure your Chromecast is powered and running properly.
There's one last solution to address inconsistent streaming quality and other connectivity issues relating to Chromecast, and it's particularly relevant in households with a bunch of devices constantly sucking Wi-Fi juice. By default, routers treat all data the same, whether you're watching a YouTube video on your phone, doing some online gaming on a PC or console, or downloading legally-sourced files using BitTorrent.
Fortunately, most routers have Quality of Service settings that let you prioritize specific devices connected to your network. This might go by a different name depending on the brand of modem or router you own. For example, I've got the Linksys Velop mesh router set up in my home to help extend the Wi-Fi network to all corners of my home, and it lets me set device prioritization for anything connected to my network right in the Linksys app. If the router you own has a companion app, you're sure to find a similar setting in there.
Otherwise, you may need to log into your router settings by typing your router manufacturer's default IP address, typically something like http://192.168.1.1, into your preferred web browser and then logging into the admin settings (the default username and password are almost always admin and admin).
You should find QoS settings there, but if not this might be the perfect time to upgrade your home network to a mesh system like the above mentioned Linksys Velop or Google WiFi, which each include a simple to use apps that's designed to help out in situations like this.
Say you've been streaming a show or movie from an app on your phone for a while, then go to pause the show using the Chromecast controls on your phone — but they're nowhere to be found! The show is still streaming fine on your TV, but you can't find the Chromecast controls in your notification shade and even the app is saying it's no longer streaming over Chromecast.
This is super frustrating, but it's caused by your phone just trying to do you a solid by turning off some app functions running in the background. It thinks you're not using your phone and wants to preserve battery life.
By default, Android tries to optimize your phone's battery life by restricting apps from running in the background. This is, generally speaking, a good thing, but can cause issues on an app-to-app basis and especially when you're using your phone or tablet to stream Netflix or some other app to Chromecast. You should be able to fix the issue of the disappearing Chromecast controls by turning off battery optimization for the affected apps.
Once you've got your issues sorted out, you may as well buy more Chromecasts for every TV in your home, right?
The best Chromecast you can get
It's double the price of the standard Chromecast, but you can stream in 4K HDR and get an Ethernet adapter in the box. At this price, your options for 4K HDR streaming are limited, so the Chromecast Ultra is a great choice.
The Chromecast Ultra is the more futureproof option if you're in the market for a new one. It supports 4K HDR streaming and also works with Google Stadia for all your game streaming needs, too.
The cheapest way to get into Chromecast
If you're looking for the cheapest possible way to start streaming to your TV, the 3rd-gen Chromecast fits the bill. It's half the price of the Ultra, making it appealing for anyone who doesn't stream 4K or wants to connect a secondary TV.
While the 3rd gen Chromecast lacks support for 4K content, it's half the price and still a mighty streamer that's good enough for most folks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google is improving memory management for all Pixel phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On December 9, Google announced the first feature drop for its Pixel smartphones, and in addition to new features that will be visible to users, Google also updated the way Pixel phones handle memory management. Google says the new memory update "proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time — like games, streaming content and more." Specifically, Google calls out improvements to gaming and streaming content, but did not offer further details.

While the first feature drop also offered updates to Google Duo video calls and a handful of other tweaks to system apps and features, the memory improvement marks a significant step forward for Google's update plans. In the (distant) past, updates to system features like memory management would be bundled into a larger update. By parsing updates into smaller pieces and offering them through a simpler download procedure, Google can sidestep these lengthy carrier-enforced delays.
Google says these features are already rolling out and all Pixel devices will get the new memory management. No plans were announced for future system-level updates, but Google says to expect these on a "regular basis."
Furthermore, this improved memory management is rolling out to "all Pixel devices", meaning Pixels of old and new will be able to benefit from it.
A remarkable mid-ranger from Google
If you've been dying to get your hands on a Pixel 4 XL but can't justify its high starting price, the Pixel 3a XL was made just for you. It has the same camera found on the Pixel 3, Android 10, and it's guaranteed to get software updates and feature drops for three years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Calendar adds the ability to move events between calendars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Managing multiple calendars with the Google Calendar Android app has always posed a bit of a challenge when needing to move an event from one to the other. Previously, if you had an event you wanted to move, you could copy or duplicate it to the other calendar. While that was convenient, it still required the extra step of deleting the original event.
Thankfully, that's all about to change, thanks to a new update that is currently rolling out for the app. With the ability to move the event, you'll no longer need to take this extra step in the future. Simply move the event from one calendar to the next, and move on with your day. For example, if you manage your work and personal calendar from your phone, you'll now be able to move an event from one to the other.
Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at Verizon
The update is being rolled out via a server-side switch, meaning it is not currently live for all users, even if you have the latest version of the app. However, once it has rolled out to your phone, you'll be able to move events from one calendar to the next by following these steps.
Source: Android Police
For anyone who has to manage multiple calendars, this will be a small change that makes using Google Calendar much more convenient. Even though it is currently rolling out via a server-side switch, you can try to speed up the process by force quitting the app and clearing its cache. Android Police notes that helped trigger the change on some devices for them, but most likely you'll have to be patient and wait for the feature to roll out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's first Pixel 'feature drop' brings Portrait Blur, automatic call screen, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google today announced that it will be bringing new features to its Pixel phones on a regular basis with "feature drops." The first 'feature drop' will soon be rolled out for the Pixel 4 series phones and come with several new features and enhancements.
Perhaps the most exciting new feature that will be part of the first feature drop will be the ability to turn any photo into a portrait by blurring the background post-snap. This means regardless of when a photo was taken, you can head over to Google Photos and blur the background with Portrait Blur.
The second major feature coming to the Pixel 4 series phones is automatic call screening. The latest update to Call Screen on Pixel 4 in the U.S. makes it possible for the Google Assistant to automatically screen phone calls from unknown callers and filter out detected robocalls without interrupting you.

You can also look forward to improved video calls, as the update will help you better focus on your conversations on Duo. The Auto-framing feature will use the Pixel 4's wide-angle lens to keep your face centered during video calls, even when you move around. And when someone else joins you in the shot, the camera will adjust to ensure both of you are in the frame. To get rid of spotty audio, a machine learning model on the Pixel 4 will predict the likely next sound so your conversation can continue with minimal disruptions. Additionally, the update will bring the ability to add a portrait filter during video calls, along with reduced choppiness thanks to the Smooth Display refreshing up to 90 times a second.
In addition to the new features, Google says the update will bring faster accuracy in Google Maps as well as improved on-device computing for better location quality. Google is also expanding the availability of the new Google Assistant to the UK, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and Australia.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Popular industry insider Ice Universe has shared two 'hands-on' images showing the Samsung Galaxy S11 inside a "leakproof case." Since the case hides nearly every key design element of the phone except the rear camera layout, we cannot be entirely sure if the phone inside the case is indeed the Galaxy S11. However, Ice Universe does have a pretty good track record and the camera module appears very similar to what was showcased in recently leaked CAD-based renders of the phone.
Even though the images are extremely grainy, we can still see the overhauled rear camera layout. They also show the significant camera hump that the phone will have. If @OnLeaks is to be believed, the camera hump on the Galaxy S11 will protrude by 1.1mm.

Along with the two hands-on images, Ice Universe has also shed some light on the primary 108MP camera sensor that Samsung will be using in its 2020 flagships. The company will apparently use a custom 1/1.3-inch type 108MP sensor, with superior image quality compared to the ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that is used in the Xiaomi Mi Note 10.
In addition to the 108MP primary sensor, Samsung's Galaxy S11 lineup is also expected to have an upgraded telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. Low-light performance is another area where Samsung's upcoming flagships are expected to excel, thanks to a new "Bright Night Sensor" that the company has developed.

Google News has been around for quite some time, but it was left untouched for far too long.

On the other hand, Palabre, is for the more "power users" who are looking for more from their news app. This is especially true with the various add-ons that can be used while being capable of working with your RSS aggregator of choice, or even hand-picked Twitter accounts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leaked OnePlus 8 Lite renders give us our first look at the company's upcoming mid-ranger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In October 2015, OnePlus announced its first mid-range Android smartphone, called the OnePlus X. Now, CAD-based renders showing a new mid-range smartphone from the Chinese Android OEM have surfaced, courtesy of popular leaker @OnLeaks and 91Mobiles.
As can be seen in the renders below, the phone, which is expected to be called the 'OnePlus 8 Lite', will have a flat display with a centered hole-punch cutout. On the back of the mid-range phone will be a rectangular camera module housing two sensors, an LED flash, as well as a ToF sensor.
The CAD-based renders of the smartphone also show a USB-C port on the bottom, along with an alert slider on the side. Unsurprisingly, the OnePlus 8 Lite will not include a 3.5mm headphone jack.

According to @OnLeaks, the phone will come with a display between 6.4" – 6.5". As for physical dimensions, the upcoming mid-range phone will measure 159.2 x 74 x 8.6mm. Unfortunately, however, there is no word yet on the hardware specifications of the OnePlus 8 Lite.
Nor do we know exactly when the smartphone will be officially unveiled, although it is likely that it will be made official alongside the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro sometime in the first half of 2020. The only thing that we can be fairly sure about at this point is that the phone will be significantly more affordable than the OnePlus 7T.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Design mock-ups of the DualShock 5 are starting appear.
LetsGoDigital, the site responsible for creating mock-ups of the PS5 devkit, Nintendo Switch VR and other devices based on patents and leaked images, has returned with a possible design for the DualShock 5 controller.
The design mainly uses a recent Sony patent as its basis. In the patent, which was granted last week, Sony details a technology that would enable a controller to be used by more than one remote user simultaneously.
The idea is that one player would be able to share their game session with another, who’s then given partial or full control of the first player’s controller. This is an advanced form of PS4’s Share Play feature, with a major difference being the ability for a cloud server to handle combined input at a larger scale than what’s currently possible on PS4.
The improved design also appears to offer more granular control over the process, such as assigning different buttons/functions to different players on the same controller, which could be very helpful for players with disabilities.
Although the filings do not explicitly state this to be a feature of the PS5 or its controller, LetsGoDigital took the liberty of imagining what it could look like given what we know about the PS5 controller.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mechwarrior 5 has been a long time coming, and you thankfully won’t have to wait too much longer to play it.
Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries, which developer Piranha Games announced almost exactly three years ago, will finally launch tomorrow, December 10 on PC.
Mercenaries is a single-player, story-driven game based on the simulation engine that powers Mechwarrior Online, utilising many of its mechanics and features. The game supports co-op for four players, which will be filled in by AI when you’re running solo.
Similar to Battletech, Mercenaries lets you manage a company of mercenaries, look after repairs and upgrades, and hire skilled pilots for the different missions. You’ll also be given control of how to best manage salvage and set up your squad for better odds of survival.
Within the missions themselves, you’ll take on other mechs, planetary defences, as well as traditional attack vehicles. Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries is an Epic Games Store exclusive. The launch trailer below should get you in the mood.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne’s Safi’jiva Siege brings transforming armor and Awakened weapons to the game</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Safi’Jiva Siege will kick off next week in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.
Alongside the new Siege comes new armor for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne players as well as three new weapons.
Right now a recon quest related to  Safi’jiva (the adult form of  Xeno’jiiva) is live in-game, which will familiarize you with what to expect once the siege goes live December 13 and through January 5.
The armour set you will earn from taking the monster out sounds rather cool. Once you have the entire set bonus active, the gear will change form. As far as the weapons are concerned, once you defeat the monster you will receive Awakened versions.
Once you have the weapons appraised, you can choose three to keep. At least one of the weapons will match the type you currently have equipped. Each of the weapons will start with the same base stats but feature different elements and statuses.
After slaying the Safi’jiva, you’ll be able to get the new material, Rigid Dracolite. You can then choose the weapons you want, each can be upgraded using the Rigid Dracolite. Upgrading adds Awakened abilities and these abilities, which are rolled, can increase affinity, sharpness, or even an armor kill bonus to the weapon.
If you hit up Arekkz’s video below, he explains the new system and RNG elements in detail.
You can now earn the Defender Armor and weapons in-game, which will give your stats a much-needed boost if you’re new to Monster Hunter World or haven’t played in a while and need to catch up a few levels. There’s a story mode you can complete that will net you these items and it’s pretty straightforward Monster Hunting.
The Defender Armor will give you the following skills:
You can also simply buy the armour for 300 Zenny per item, which is a bargain.
Also coming next week is the second part of the Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds collaboration for PS4 users.
The event goes live on December 12. Here you will have the chance to craft all-new themed equipment fashioned after the Shield-Weaver armor and upgrade the Stormslinger weapon from the previous November quest.
The opportunity to upgrade Aloy’s Bow and craft a new Felyne Watcher equipment will also be available and Palico companions can get special gear designed after Frostclaws, the bear-like machines from the game.
And a third round of exclusive collaboration quests for PS4 players will be available on December 26. This event will let you create the Banuk α+ armor set which was originally available in  Monster Hunter World with Master Rank level stats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rocket League’s new blueprint system catches a tonne of flak despite getting rid of loot boxes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rocket League players have not received the game’s new blueprints system well.
Rocket League developer Psyonix recently rolled out the big blueprints update to the game. The patch mainly overhauls how rewards are doled out.
The most significant change in this update is the removal of loot boxes and their associated keys. Rocket League now awards blueprints to players as they play, which are used to unlock a specific item. In some cases, blueprints require a set cost of Credits (paid currency) to turn into an item.
The new system was designed to be fair and straightforward, taking away the mystery associated with loot boxes and giving players a clear path towards unlocking the items they need. It was also accompanied by a new store, which is likely built on the same principles, using the same currency.
Unfortunately, there’s been a clear outrage amongst players in the days following the update’s release. The game’s official subreddit is full of players claiming the old system was more rewarding, and others putting forward solutions to what they see as problems.
There are two main issues in particular players have with the new system. First, blueprints are not as rewarding as the old loot boxes. Part of this is the surprise element, of course, but the other reason is that opening a loot box awarded players a number of items, whereas blueprints can only turn into a single item.
Even when loot boxes required a key, the return on investment would have been better considering the number of items within each box, not to mention the chance at a high-tier drop. Although Rocket League allows players to trade blueprints on the market, the value of the more common items is low enough that many don’t see the point.
The other thing is that players want is the ability to trade blueprints for Credits, even if just for a tiny amount, since that at least would make it possible to buy items outright. There’s also the matter of store prices, which players say are exorbitant.
Psyonix has yet to comment, though it has only been a few days since the update went live.

Ripple by Hsin-Jou Huang, Szu-Ying Lai and Chia-Ning Hsu
For people with functional limitations who rely on their family to perform day-to-day tasks, masturbation is often not an option.
This three-piece, multi-sensory sex toy allows them to take matters into their own hands via a remote controlled, inflatable bodysuit that can vibrate or exert pressure as desired, a pheromone-releasing eye mask and headphones playing soothing ASMR sounds.

Braille Bricks by Lego
Work meets play in this collection of Lego bricks, which sees the product's trademark circular studs arranged to form Braille letters, digits and mathematical symbols, in order to help children with visual impairments learn to decipher them.
The hope is to reengage a new generation with this physical writing system, which has increasingly fallen out of favour thanks to the proliferation of digital solutions such as audiobooks.

Lifetools by Nicola Golfari and Scivola
A number of projects this year have focused on being inclusive – normalising accessible products for everyday use rather than ghettoising them for use by only certain groups of people.
That's why this minimal series or furniture and homeware, which includes a foldaway shower seat and a tilting mirror, is designed to be beautiful and desirable in its own right, rather than solely functional for a particular group.

Wheelie by Hoobox Robotics and Intel
This adapter kit can be installed in most electric wheelchairs in just seven minutes, making them controllable via the facial expressions of the person driving. This helps the user to manoeuvre more independently.
The system relies on a 3D depth camera – that can judge both depth and distance – to read the expressions, before a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm is used to analyse and convert them into concrete commands.

TypeCase by Dougie Mann
The five buttons of Dougie Mann's simplified keyboard can be operated with a single hand and without looking, to enable people with motor or visual impairments to type on a smartphone.
However, like the Lifetools collection, it is also designed for use by the wider public and could keep us from being constantly glued to our screens or help us to take notes more efficiently.

Exoskeleton by Clinatec
Clinatec's full-body exoskeleton is wirelessly linked up to the wearer's brain through implants and, for the first time ever, allows quadriplegic patients to move all four of their limbs just by willing the suit into action.
So far it has only been used by a single test patient – who practised for more than two years to be able to operate it – but the programme is currently being expanded in order to gather larger data sets and refine the algorithms at the heart of the technology.

X-Suite by M-Rad
Meanwhile, architecture practice M-Rad proved that accessibility can be seamlessly integrated into even the smallest of spaces, with a series of California holiday cabins.
Here, a wooden deck functions as a ramp, while dramatic double-doors make for easy entry in a series of simple adjustments that don't call attention to themselves.

Inmergo by Rocco Giovannoni
Bone-conducting headphones – in which sound waves are transmitted by vibrating the bones in the skull, rather than the eardrum – have long been popular among people who are hard of hearing. But their sound quality can leave much to be desired.
This design hopes to improve on that experience by making listeners feel like they are "inside the song" through a helmet of five speakers, each encased in a silicone membrane filled with an ultrasonic gel which sits against their skin.

Facing Emotions by Huawei and the Polish Blind Association
An app developed for Huawei's Mate 20 Pro phone uses sound to help people with visual impairments recognise the emotions of their conversation partner.
Using the rear-facing camera and an offline machine-learning algorithm, the app is able to identify seven key emotions and translate them into distinct sounds that were created by blind composer Tomasz Bilecki to be easily recognisable yet unobtrusive.

ThisAbles by IKEA, Milbat and Access Israel
Rather than having to invest in entirely new furniture, this series of 13 add-ons can be downloaded and 3D printed by anyone, to make existing IKEA pieces in their home more usable for people with special needs.
This includes handles to make shower curtains or cupboard doors easier to open, as well as holders for cups or walking sticks that can be attached to a bed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Creator of Google Voice on How 5G Will Change the Way You Work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Soon, your phone will be able to handle anything you normally do on your desktop computer--no matter where you are.
That moment can't come too soon for Craig Walker, co-creator of the communication platform Google Voice. Walker co-founded personal communication startup GrandCentral in 2005. Just two years later, Google purchased the company and rebranded it as Google Voice.
Today, Walker is co-founder and CEO of Dialpad, a company that makes a cloud-based platform that powers various aspects of businesses' voice communication, from hosting conference calls to helping train call center employees. For clients in sales and customer service, the San Francisco-based firm's software lets a user on a phone call see real-time conversation transcriptions on their screens;artificial intelligence then provides sentiment analysis andsuggests answers to customers' questions. The 450-person company has been preparing for the launch of 5G, the fifth-generation wireless network, which will enable Dialpad to expand its offerings for mobile customers. 
Currently, many of Dialpad's features are only available to desktop users. That will change with the rollout of 5G. "Once we get to a point of being able to assume the end user has this level of connectivity, we can start pushing out all these features to mobile," Walker says. With 5G, he says, "your mobile phone has all the functionality that your computer has when it's connected to a super-high-speed network."
On videoconference calls, Walker says, you'll be able to get a crystal-clear picture with no need to connect to Wi-Fi. You'll also be able to add more people to the conference without losing quality. "You'd get a little constrained by the screen size and how much your eyes can discern, but at the end of the day those are just user interface and design limitations," Walker says. "You no longer have boundaries that are based on the network quality."
Looking at the bigger picture, Walker predicts that higher-speed connections will erase much of the friction inherent to working remotely. Companies will have little hesitance about hiring the best employees regardless of their location. "The future of work is letting people be productive from wherever they are, however works best for them," he says. "And 5G is a big piece of allowing that to happen."
Of course, this is all dependent on telecom companies' actually making 5G accessible everywhere. Many carriers started rolling out 5G in the latter half of 2019, and most of the early beneficiaries have been urban areas. Some experts have expressed concern that the technology will roll out slowly--if at all--to rural customers because of the low return on investment of building infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.
But if it does, expect big changes. Though Walker admits he's biased, he predicts that communication will be the industry most revolutionized by the rollout of 5G. "This will affect the whole future of work," he says, "and the future of society, and the future of productivity."

    <h5 class="mb-1">If You See Someone Driving a Tesla Cybertruck Around Los Angeles, It's Elon Musk</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are times when Elon Musk does something that makes you think it's a stroke of marketing genius. And driving around Los Angeles in a Cybertruck while media outlets snap pictures and video might just be one of them.
This weekend, Musk went to the popular sushi restaurant Nobu in his new, and soon to launch Cybertruck. Reporter Joel Franco captured a video of Musk leaving Nobu for TMZ. And as the Tesla chief executive sped off in what might be the most interesting looking pickup truck on the road, he ran over a sign.
It was a fitting ending and helped to answer some questions about Cybertruck. For one, it would appear that Musk's Cybertruck is street legal and despite a wildly different kind of design than other trucks.
Moreover, it also confirmed that at least right now, the Cybertruck really is one of the most interesting and decidedly cool-looking cars on the road. As Musk sped away in his company's latest creation, I have to admit that it looked far more compelling than a boxy pickup from Ford or Chevrolet making a getaway.
Why else write about it? Musk's move was a stroke of marketing genius.
Musk and Tesla have long championed that the company doesn't spend money on advertising to promote its vehicles. Instead, the company relies on its chief executive and the attention he gets.
Against that backdrop, Musk decided to take his newest vehicle on the roads of Los Angeles. He knew the move would be newsworthy and get attention, especially coming the week his defamation trial ended. And in turn, it likely drove an increase in orders for the Cybertruck. It also gave folks who are at least on the fence about whether to order the Cybertruck an opportunity to see it in action.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about Musk driving Cybertruck around, however, is that it's not even close to launching. While customers can order it now with a fully refundable $100 deposit, Cybertruck production is delayed and likely won't start getting to customers until late 2021, at the earilest.
But in Tesla's world, it's good to be Elon Musk. Not only was he clearly at the front of the line for Cybertruck production, but he also found a way to snag one off the assembly line to drive it around Los Angeles.
So, if you're driving in LA and happen to see a Cybertruck on the road, call out for Elon. He's probably driving.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peloton's Controversial Ad Wasn't a Total Loss; It Taught Entrepreneurs a Valuable Lesson in Consumer Behavior</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No matter which side of the fence you're on with the recent Peloton ad debacle, there's no arguing that the company missed an opportunity to showcase its core values, what differentiates it, and why it's a special company with a special product. According to CNBC, Peloton says it's "disappointed in how some have misinterpreted this commercial" but said it has received an "outpouring of support from those who understand what we were trying to communicate."
Yet, as demonstrated by the massive social media backlash, Peloton made a mistake no company should make in our modern marketplace. There's a lesson here for small businesses: Stick to your core message, your guiding principles, and what's representative of the culture that makes your loyal customers so devoted and engaged.
The holiday commercial makes Peloton out to be a product for a superficial and ego-driven marketplace, but that's not what Peloton is really about. The success of Peloton and other fitness revolutionaries, like Orangetheory, is driven by their reliance on the science of intrinsic motivation. Peloton is part of a movement of organizations that tap into insights about human behavior to create products, services, and experiences that are genuine and personal. They connect to people in ways that build loyalty and engagement.
"Behavioral science has found that extrinsic (or external) incentives -- like money or good looks or fleeting praise and punishment -- do not engender engagement and sustainable motivation," says Jeff Kreisler, editor-in-chief of behavioral science website PeopleScience.com. "If you give people a bonus for certain behavior, they may change what they do. However, when you take that bonus structure away, they'll revert right back to their old habits."
On the other hand, research shows that intrinsic (or internal) incentives inspire something deep and meaningful. Peloton's practice, if not its ads, shows that people can change their lives with science.
Peloton is part of a growing, though still fairly unique, approach to selling an age-old product (fitness) by appealing to human behavioral motivators. The tactics keep customers with any body shape and fitness level engaged, satisfied, and thirsting for more. "Understanding how to play to the human psyche is valuable for any leader, because determining what motivates customers and employees is a major contributor to organizational success," says Kreisler.
"Fitness" is an ambiguous concept, so we need to focus on something more immediate and tangible to pursue that goal. Peloton rides include a dynamic leaderboard, and users can earn badges and rewards for reaching various workout goals. This gamifies the workout experience, which is key. Research by Christopher Hsee and his associates demonstrated that when there's a medium point--i.e., badges, points, standing on the leaderboard--between our effort and our goal, we have a bias toward maximizing the medium itself. In other words, gamification helps us reach our goals.
At the same time, Peloton also connects users to their higher purpose, transforming what can be challenging workouts into an experience driven by something more significant. Kreisler points out that instructors inspire riders to remember why they strapped in, to focus on the future pleasure rather than the pains of the present. "Such focus on purpose can have a massive impact on engagement from the exercise bike to the boardroom and beyond," he says.
Throughout the rides, Peloton uses other behavioral insights like endowed progress and recognition (why the commercial actor was so "excited" that the instructor called her out) to ignite internal motivators.
"Peloton creates a tribe, using the power of social inclusion and our inherent need to belong," says Kreisler. "We are a species that needs to feel like we belong, sometimes to an extreme." The word peloton means a pack of riders, working together toward a goal. Somehow, even though users are all working out alone and remotely, Peloton gets them to feel like they are part of a team.
All of that is why Peloton is a huge success. Not the stuff we see in the ad, but the invisible stuff that motivates us to get up and try, to take action, to find meaning.
The ad addresses none of that; it is superficial. Our consumer culture is overflowing with appeals to the superficial--beauty, status, consumption--so it's understandable that the ad triggered a response to those aspects of the pitch. "Appeals to the internal benefits based upon sound principles of behavioral science and what matters to people require more thoughtfulness than Peloton exhibited," says Kreisler. "The ad never got close to showing that Peloton taps into who we are and what we feel, rather than how we look or what our husband thinks of us."
Had the ad focused on what's fundamentally special about Peloton, it would not have received any backlash; it would have been successful. The ad could have depicted the Peloton recipient getting badges or passing people on the leaderboard. Had the actress demonstrated her commitment out of obligation to other riders or connected to some higher purpose or goal, the ad would not have missed the mark.
Who knows? The brand may have intentionally chosen to spark disruption, but it's not likely. Peloton neglected to go back to its core message before producing this particular ad. This is the major takeaway for business owners: Know your mission, purpose, and values. Use them as the foundation for everything you do, and never make the mistake of straying from them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Has Added an Interest-Free Way to Buy an iPhone and Pay For It Over Time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple's iPhones are expensive. But the company is adding a new way for you to pay for them, that could help you spread the cost over time without paying any interest in the process.
The folks over at Apple-tracking site 9to5Mac have discovered some new language Apple has added to its Apple Card payment options that includes mention of the ability to pay for the iPhone over time with no interest.
According to the text Apple added to the "Learn More" payment box, if you buy an iPhone with Apple Card, you can now choose an installment option. Those installment payments, which vary depending on the iPhone version you choose, are added to your Apple Card monthly minimum payment amount.
"Installments aren't subject to interest like other purchases made with Apple Card," Apple writes, according to 9to5Mac. "If you pay more toward your installment balance, you may reduce the overall number of payments, but are still scheduled to pay your installment payment the following month."
So, rather than buy the iPhone outright or finance it with interest payments, you can instead buy an iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max and simply apply your installments to your minimum payment. Best of all, it's interest-free.
If that sounds familiar, it's because Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed the possibility of Apple launching a zero-interest installment plan option on iPhone purchases during his company's October earnings call. He noted at the time that iPhone payments would be spread over 24 months, so if you buy a $999 iPhone 11 Pro, for instance, you'd pay $41.63 per month.
The option is a potential boon for both Apple and those who buy an iPhone. On Apple's side, it's enticing people to pay into its own payment plans, earning the full cost of the iPhone for itself. Better yet, it's providing folks with another reason to get into Apple Card. Indeed, in addition to the interest-free option, the iPhone offer includes 3% in Daily Cash on the Apple Card. On a $1,000 iPhone, that's a $30 savings on the Apple Card balance. It's not a big savings, but it's a savings nonetheless.
Apple has been trying to make the argument for the past couple of years in which its flagship iPhone pricing has jumped that there are alternative ways to bring the price down. One of those is by trading in used phones for new models and reducing its cost. An interest-free way of paying over time is another. And for many shoppers on a budget, it makes the iPhone far more affordable -- especially during the costly holiday shopping season when there's plenty to spend on friends and family.
Needless to say, Apple really wants you to buy an iPhone. And it's willing to wait on getting all of the cash for it to make it happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">5 Steps to Perfecting Social Media, According to an Early Employee of Twitter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the launch of my latest book, Social Media Success for Every Brand: The Five Pillars that Turn Posts into Profits, I had my publisher throw a bunch of spaghetti on my face. Surprisingly, there was a method to my madness.
After recording it, we turned the social media moment into an advertisement for the book which was then shared on social media and got folks to buy my new book. The reason that throwing around perfectly good pasta drove book sales? It has everything to do with my five step model for success on social media. (And a tiny little bit to do with people's love of pasta.)
Content is queen, and the content for effective social media marketing comes from a clear brand story. Once you figure out what your clear story is, then it's time to actually go about telling it on social media.
Think of your social media account like a bank account. The cardinal rule of bank accounts? Deposit more than you withdraw. On social media, that means you want to follow the 80-20 rule. Make sure to always spend 80 percent of your time depositing value in the form of the original or curated content you share, like articles, quotations, statistics, testimonials, direct calls to action, transitional calls to action, impactful images, selfies, videos, etc. Then, 20 percent of the time call your social media followers to action by asking them to sign up for your newsletter, buy your product, or tell a friend about your awesomeness.
The most important thing you need to know when it comes to how to post on social media is which platform to focus on. Not all platforms work for all brands, and one of the biggest mistakes people make is to spend all their time on a platform that simply doesn't work for their audience or customers.
Once you know what your priority social media platform is, then it's time to create a social media schedule and social media editorial calendar that works for your audience and your brand's bandwidth.
Your brand is not your hero, your customer is. That means that your customer (or potential customer) is your follower. Reframe your social media account to make it about them.
One great way to do that is by generating empathy, and thus engagement. My favorite tips to do so? Help someone out on social media or ask a question. And remember, don't post and ghost; great social media marketing requires real-time connection and engagement with your audience.
It doesn't matter how many times Facebook changes its algorithm, one thing will always be true: Social media companies will always reward engaged accounts with greater reach. That means that your goal should always be to focus on engaging with your existing social media tribe in order to expand the ultimate reach of your posts, and not on chasing new followers with the latest social media trick.
Here are a few ways to do this. First, craft a killer social media profile that increases your authority. Next, remember that great hashtags can put great content on steroids. When crafting a hashtag, be as general as you can without using a term people already associate with something else. Finally, remember that influencer marketing, when used wisely, can posts go further.
The real-time nature of social media means that you never know what's going to happen. Make that a good thing and learn to roll with the social media punches. If your brand makes a social media mistake, own up to it. Fast.
In terms of low hanging fruit, remember that social media gives your customers a public place to share their grievances, and sometimes they will do just that. If the comments aren't offensive, let the dialogue take place, and don't delete the negative content. Then, try to turn a negative conversation into a positive one.
And what happens if things get really bad? Take a cue from the American Red Cross, who managed to mistakenly send out a drunken tweet, and yet by handling the situation with grace, humor, and transparency, to actually raise donations in the process.
Ultimately, social media is the most ubiquitous, and least expensive marketing tool your brand has, and learning to use it well to drive sales is one of the best uses of your marketing time. Don't waste time throwing spaghetti media marketing spaghetti around with abandon, however. Get a plan for social media success.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Introduces Beta Explanations that Can Explain Smaller Issues with SEO Marketing Campaigns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During the holiday season, there are many ways for consumers to use Google AdWords and other marketing tools from Google to improve a website. Though Google uses these signals to help SEO marketers create better performing campaigns, many of these programs leave errors that can be affected by the website in question. Google will attempt to make it easier for SEO experts to understand why a social media site isn't having the results that a website owner wants to see.
According to a statement left behind by Google Ads, the system will leave clues about why a certain campaign doesn't have an issue with the website owners. Google Ads stated that "Understanding why your performance changes is critical when optimizing a campaign. However, it can be time-consuming to diagnose why your metrics can fluctuate. To help you understand some performance changes in your campaigns and ad groups faster, you can now request explanations."
Despite the promise from Google Ads, there are issues that website owners should keep in mind when searching for the cause behind a particular up or down movement on a site, there are several factors to keep in mind. 
First, the new explanations are only currently available for manual CPC or eCPC Search campaigns. There are many ways to run an SEO campaign and in most cases, alternative advertising methods won't be used by Google Ads to make a decision about the past.  
Whenever you try to make comparisons that can help SEO marketers understand a situation, it's important to measure apples to apples. To prevent the system from trying to make inaccurate explanations, it can compare two time periods of equal length within the last 90 days. 
Finally, the system is designed to showcase explanations that are only for campaigns with significant performance changes. The system is relatively new, and it may be a while before Google Ads is ready to dig deep into the weeds to locate potential issues that could affect an AdWords campaign.
It's worth remembering that this new feature is still in the beta stage. Your mileage may vary, so SEO experts shouldn't be heading into the situation with a lot of potential questions they want to see answered. At this early stage, website owners will need to keep on their thinking caps for looking at issues that could affect the spread of their AdWords campaign. 
According to Google, SEO marketers should pay attention to these changes to get a better understanding of their overall SEO campaign. Some of the issues that can show up in these explanations include, "a view of the most likely reasons for impression, click, and cost changes with the click of a button. This [system] makes it easy for you to spend more time focusing on optimization, and less time investigating performance issues. For example, let's say you notice a big week-over-week drop in impressions for one of your campaigns. Rather than diving into multiple reports to find out what happened, you can just click on the "See Explanations" button on your campaign and ad group tables while in time comparison mode."
Even though the system has limited accuracy, it's worthwhile for SEO marketers to use these tools to better understand their social media ad campaigns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The FBI Is Warning That Your Smart Home Devices Aren't Secure. Here's What You Should Do About It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You may have heard that the FBI is warning people about their smart TVs, smart speakers, and smart home devices in general. Just last week, the Portland, Oregon Field Office issued two notices warning people that they may be susceptible to hackers through these devices since they often lack the same level of security features found on computers or smartphones. 
In fact, most of the smart home devices you connect to your router have almost no security at all, which means it's important to take steps to secure your home network as a whole. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to strengthen your security.
You wouldn't believe how many people leave their wireless router open to the public. Considering your WiFi is the entry to your home network, it would be like leaving your front door unlocked and open for anyone to walk in. I think we can all agree that's a bad idea. Instead, use encryption such as WPA2, and use a secure password. 
Also, change the name for router to something that isn't associated with your name or your address. That makes it harder for would-be hackers to pinpoint your location based on the name of your network. Also, it should go without saying, but let's just say it: never, ever, ever use the default name or password for any device. 
Most of us are notoriously bad at keeping our passwords secure. That's true of our Netflix account, and it's true of our home WiFi. Instead, most of the routers you can buy today allow you to create a "guest network" that doesn't allow access to the devices on your secure network. That means your friends can get online without running the risk that anyone might access your smart home. 
The key is to make sure to use a different strong password for this network. Some routers, like the NetGear ORBI allow you to set an expiration for a guest network session, which provides an added layer of security. 
WiFi-enabled printers, like many HP models, include a handy feature called Direct Print. This creates an SSID broadcast directly from the printer, allowing you to print directly to the printer without connecting to your WiFi network. The problem is, chances are, your printer is connected to your network. If you're using AirPrint, for example, there's really no reason to enable direct print, especially since it means that you've essentially left the back door of your network wide open for anyone to connect. 
Just because your laptop uses a firewall doesn't mean the rest of your network is secure. Many routers have a firewall you can turn on, but if you really want to be safe, you can purchase hardware options that can be placed between your modem and your WiFi access point. That prevents malicious data from coming in, or bad guys from accessing anything on your network. 
The SonicWall SOHO and BitDefender Box 2 are both good home options that are easy to to set up, but still give you control over your security settings. Even a firewall built into your WiFi router or modem is better than nothing.
Most of us pay attention to security updates on our iPhones or Android devices. We're a little worse about our laptops, but at least recognize that it's probably a good idea to keep those up to date. Did you know most of your internet-connected devices could use an update every once in a while as well?
Some, like Google's smart speakers or Nest thermostats and cameras, will automatically check for updates on their own. They'll download and install them without you having to do anything. Others, like your smart TV probably need you to update them manually. You should. Set yourself a reminder each month to check for important security updates.

The Bose 700 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones were released earlier this year, and they cost $400 compared to $350 for the QC35 headphones. They’re so exclusive that they didn’t even get a discount during Black Friday or Cyber Week this year, but they’re somehow on sale right now on Amazon. That’s right… the Bose 700 headphones just got their first big discount for Green Monday 2019!

    <h5 class="mb-1">GOG Galaxy 2.0 is now in open beta</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GOG Galaxy 2.0 started its slow rollout earlier this year, transforming the application from a launcher for your GOG-purchased games to a way to bring all your disparate PC platforms together. While the beta has been invite-only up until this point, you can now download the new GOG Galaxy in open beta.
If you haven’t checked in with GOG Galaxy 2.0 in a while, updates have added features like global search, manual game additions, and the ability to see the online status of your friends from other platforms. The launcher still only officially supports GOG and Xbox Live, but open-source community integrations have brought support for Steam, Epic, Battle.net, Uplay, Origin, and plenty more, including emulators and individual game launchers for MMOs.
“We’re amazed and thankful for the reaction from the community to the app and taking it even further by creating integrations with 20 gaming platforms – allowing everyone to see all their games and friends in GOG Galaxy 2.0,” GOG managing director Piotr Karwowski says in a press release.
You can download the new GOG Galaxy from the official site, or check out a broad overview of its features below.
While GOG Galaxy 2.0 has been getting plenty of buzz, it’s not the only launcher in its class. Fully community-built programs like Playnite have been around for much longer and offer similar features. While the options for places to buy and play your PC games have gotten overwhelming in the past few years, the options for apps to bring those libraries together is much-appreciated.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Walmart issued an apology for a Christmas sweater on the store's Canadian website that featured a reference to doing illicit drugs.
The sweater, which was formerly available from a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, featured Santa Claus with lines of what the product description called "quality, grade A, Colombian snow," but online observers agreed was a reference to cocaine.
"These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart's values and have no place on our website," Walmart said in a statement to Global News. "We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offense this may have caused."
The listing, which has now been removed, was credited to clothing company FUN Wear.

When it comes to activity trackers, Fitbit have a few to choose from. The Fitbit Charge 3 may not be the cheapest among them, but it does a lot for you. It tracks heart rate, links with your phone for smart notifications and automatically tracks your exercise throughout the day. The Charge 3 comes with a decently sized - though not overly large - touch screen, and there are no buttons to mess about with - you can swipe to scroll through the menus and tap on the function you want; to go back, you simply squeeze the sides of the display. Plus the battery life will last at least five days in my experience, although Fitbit puts the official tally at a week.

Samsung keeps things simple with the Galaxy Fit. Lightweight and reasonably compact, the fitness tracker will keep a close eye on your activity throughout the day and your sleep at night. There is no connected GPS, but you will get automatic exercise tracking and heart rate alerts so you know when to pick up the pace. It will also monitor your stress levels too.
The Galaxy Fit is water and dust resistant too, and although it is a Samsung device, it is compatible with both iOS and Android. Basically, you have choices.

If you like your activity tracker to look less like a sports band and more like a watch, the Withings Move is the one for you. The device tracks your activity, from walking, running, swimming and more to your sleep. But you can’t access it on the watch itself; the only concession is a third hand that shows you how close you are to your daily goal. Other than that, the Withings Move looks like a traditional watch. There is no touch screen, no digital screen at all in fact. If you want to see all the detail on your day, you’ll need to connect your watch with the Withings Health Mate app, and sync your activity regularly. Daily activity is tracked automatically, but you can start recording a workout with a long press of the side button on the watch, which will also start up the connected GPS to track your movement. It all adds up to longer battery life - the watch has a replaceable battery that should last six months or so - and a much cheaper price. It’s also compatible with both iOS and Android.

Garmin knows its stuff on fitness tracking. There are a few options here, including the Vivosmart and Vivosport, but the Vivofit comes in under €100 and has a one-year battery life. The colour display is customisable and always-on, tracking your steps, distance and calories burned, and sleep. Your daily step goal is personalised, so there’s not striving to meet an abitrary 10,000 steps a day. It can take a bit of water too, safe for both swimming and showering, although you might want to skip any high speed water sports. It connects with the Garmin Connect app to collect all your data and present it to you in one neat package.

€39
If you are looking for something a little more budget, the Xiaomi MiBand 4 will track your activity for under €40. The band has a colour AMOLED display just under an inch in size, and six workout modes, including treadmill, outdoor running and swimming. The latter means it is water resistant too. The battery will last around two weeks on a single charge, and it will still track your heart rate.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft is finally being updated to the unified, cross-platform-supporting Bedrock Edition tomorrow, it has been revealed. The news means that Minecraft fans playing on Switch will now be able to play with their friends who own the game on Sony's machine.
The official Minecraft website goes into a little more detail in a message to PS4 players:
Nothing else changes for Switch owners - if your copy of Minecraft is up to date, you'll already have the Bedrock edition of the game - but we have been treated to a look at how this PS4 update can improve Switch players' lives in the trailer above. We all sit in colour co-ordinated rooms when playing our favourite consoles, right? What do you mean, 'no'?
Minecraft's been having yet another successful year, earning the title of being the most-viewed game on YouTube in 2019. Considering how long the thing's been going, that's a solid achievement.
Do you have any PS4-playing friends who will be ready to team up with you going forward?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Next year, Bite the Bullet is set to combine two of our favourite things: RPGs and food. Before it does arrive on Switch, though, the developers have shared an early look at the weapons you can expect to get your hands on in-game.
You see, the game features rogue-lite RPG elements which are centred around shooting, eating, and crafting. You'll need to gun down your adversaries before dining on their corpses to craft new weapons, energise skills and special attacks, and transform into a powerful Zombro form to smash foes into smithereens.
The trailer above gives you an in-depth look at the different types of weapons in the game, as well as their capabilities. A particular favourite of ours is the Critter Cannon that lets you fire cute animals at will.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Random: Remembering When One Company Ruined Christmas For Some NES Owners</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This Christmas, we'd imagine plenty of Switch consoles are going to make their way under trees all over the world, promising a legion of new players a pretty incredible holiday season.
However, let's spare a thought for the kids back in 1989 who got a NES from Santa, only to find that their parents had also bought this accursed contraption:
That's right; parents were so scared about their children spending too much time playing video games that a company actually created a physical lock which prevented the NES from being used. The lock bolted onto the front of the console and covered the cartridge slot, preventing games from being inserted. The cads.
The device was also marketed as a protection against other people loading up your games and overwriting the save data, but we can't imagine many people bought it for that reason.
According to The Verge, Nintendo declined to officially endorse the $15.95 product, but Safe Care president Tom Lowe claimed to have sold 25,000 units.
Of course, it's not like modern young gamers have totally escaped limitations on their playtime – the Switch has a parental control app, after all – but at least it's more elegant than this ugly chastity belt for your beloved console.
Can you think of a worst Christmas present? Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival, perhaps, but it's a close call.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Polymega Slips Into Early 2020, But It's Bringing Some Cool Stuff With It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Polymega's been in the oven for quite some time now, and, like so many new hardware projects, has been subject to a few growing pains. This ambitious system is aiming to be the ultimate retro box, allowing you to not only use your original games and controllers but also download your games to internal storage to create an all-in-one solution for your vintage gaming needs. A series of replaceable modules offer support for a wide range of platforms, and there's even going to be an online store which will allow you to legally purchase retro titles direct from the rights holder.
Getting such a major project off the ground was never going to be easy; sure enough, the Polymega project took some flak early on for omitting FPGA and confidently claiming that it had the notoriously difficult Sega Saturn emulation nailed down – some of that criticism was answered, but there was always the question about if the system would hit its proposed 2019 launch date.
That big question has now been answered as the team behind Polymega has revealed that, while pilot production has commenced, the system won't be arriving until early next year. "The timeline for shipping is ASAP," says an update on the official Polymega site. "But realistically, we expect to have your console en route in the next 90 days (end of February)."
While that's not ideal news, it's hardly surprising as the company has been pretty quiet for much of the latter part of 2019. However, on the positive side, a list of compatible games has been issued which makes for pretty encouraging reading; the system is said to be "over 90% compatible" with each system's official release libraries and testing has been going on all year to document compatibility with Polymega's BIOS replacements.
The other big news involves the system's Virtual Display screen filters, which can be tinkered with quite dramatically and can be saved either globally or on a game-by-game basis. Then we have what the team at Polymega is calling "Intelligent Game Patching", which allows you to apply patches to titles and treat them as separate games, essentially running multiple versions of the same title. Oh, and a small analogue stick has been added to the RGC01 Lightgun, which will allow you to navigate the console's UI when using the controller, amongst other things.
While some of Polymega's more passionate critics have labelled the system 'vapourware', it would seem that this dream system is indeed going to make it into the hands of consumers, even if it's a little later than we'd like. Suffice to say, we'll be going hands-on with it the moment our unit arrives. Did you place a pre-order? Let us know with a comment below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Quality Of Its Microtransactions Will Decide Ubisoft's Fate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Ubisoft (OTCPK:UBSFY) is a gaming company that has very well-known gaming titles such as Rainbow Six Siege and Assassin's Creed. I think Ubisoft has the potential to become the next Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) or even Activision (ATVI) at some point. However, they still have to overcome some hurdles before they get to that level. After all, UBSFY has recently had some missteps with titles like Ghost Recon Breakpoint and, to some extent, The Division 2. Finally, my valuation for the shares suggests that there's minimal upside that these levels. So, all in all, Ubisoft is still a viable long-term hold, but not yet a deep-value investment.

Overview
To begin, let's talk about the elephant in the room: Ubisoft has been having an incredibly challenging 2019. This has been mostly due to a couple of factors. First, UBSFY has had to take some impairment charges for Ghost Recon Breakpoint and The Division 2. Also, this has caused a sharp downward revision in the expected revenues for the year. As you might expect, this alone is enough to make 2019 a very tough year for the company.
However, on top of that, Ubisoft has decided to push back the release of Gods and Monsters, Rainbow Six Quarantine, and Watch Dogs Legion into 2020. Thus, taking a step back, it's clear that 2019 has been without a doubt an awful year for the company. And unfortunately, this has been reflected in UBSFY's share price. For context, during 2019, the stock has declined by 18%, which is terrible on its own. But this performance is dismal when compared to the S&P 500, which is up 24%.

Microtransactions will decide Ubisoft’s fate
Furthermore, the year's results have shed light on Ubisoft's core risks, and opportunities boil down to one variable: successful implementation of microtransactions. Let me explain: the recent disappointment of Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a clear result of a game being built around and for microtransactions. This is a concept that gamers are instinctively starting to reject, so Ubisoft had to tread very carefully. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Ghost Recon Breakpoint incorporated microtransactions into every aspect of the game, while at the same time neglecting its replay value. Thus, it's no wonder that the game has been compared to an online shop rather than an actual game with solid gameplay. And naturally, if gamers don't have a solid reason to keep coming back to the game (i.e., fun gameplay), then they won't have a reason to keep spending on the game either.
As you might expect, this was a double whammy for UBSFY, because there were very high expectations for Ghost Recon Breakpoint. You see, Ghost Recon is a cherished franchise and has been successful in the past. However, Ghost Recon Breakpoint took an open-world spin on the franchise, which might also be part of the problem. Unfortunately, it seems that the open-world formula that Ubisoft is well-known for is starting to show cracks. In fact, in the latest earnings call, analysts started asking management whether or not the open-world formula is beginning to fall out of style. And if this is the case, it would probably translate into a further downside for the company's results. After all, Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs are also open-world games and significant revenue contributors for UBSFY.
Source:Quora. Players are starting to notice that Ubisoft recycles much of its open-world content.
I do think gamers might start getting tired of open-world games and their recycled elements. However, I don't feel that this is Ubisoft's main problem. Instead, I believe that the recent failure of GBR was mostly due to microtransactions being implemented the wrong way. Thus, Ubisoft should aim to duplicate its successful implementation of microtransactions (like Rainbow Six Siege) in its future releases. As you know, Rainbow Six Siege has a very prominent microtransactions component to its gameplay. Still, it is implemented in a very non-invasive and respectful way to gamers. Not only is it purely cosmetic, but it's entirely optional and doesn't affect gameplay in any unfair way.
But most importantly, R6's microtransactions are only a second layer for gamers, rather than the focus of the game itself. You see, what keeps players engaged in Rainbow Six Siege is its very addictive first-person shooter gameplay. R6's charm also resonates with the eSports gaming niche, which further amplifies revenues for UBSFY. Microtransactions allow gamers to keep investing themselves in the game, which only strengthens the loyalty of its player base. Yet, this is not required for casual players. I believe this strikes the perfect balance and manages to appeals to a broader crowd. In my opinion, Rainbow Six Siege should be a case study of successful microtransactions implementation for UBSFY.

Moreover, you can tell that other publishers, like Activision, have taken a cue from R6's success. For example, the latest Call of Duty has a somewhat similar approach to microtransactions. Its microtransactions are mostly cosmetic, plus there's a "seasons" angle to it too (just like R6). So far, the newest Call of Duty has been well-received, but most importantly, it has been able to avoid the typical backlash from microtransactions. In my view, this is a testament that microtransactions can be done in a way that builds a loyal fan base instead of backlash and write-downs.

Hence, Ubisoft still can redeem itself in 2020. However, it would all depend on the company's ability to learn from its mistakes on Ghost Recon Breakpoint. Management said that in 2020, it is expected to release five notable titles, and micro-transactions will be a significant part of them.
I believe that if UBSFY can hit its $2.88 billion revenue target for 2020, then its valuation does have some upside at this point. Also, I assume that the company will be able to regain its previous average EBITDA margins, while keeping CAPEX under control. I consider these are fair assumptions given that UBSFY continues to benefit from digital revenues, which have better margins. Also, Uplay and subscriptions are becoming more significant revenue contributors over time. Thus, I think we can make a reasonable estimate of UBSFY's fair value.
As you can see, my valuation model suggests that UBSFY still has a slight upside of 7.7%. This might not seem like too much, but it is worth keeping in mind that the discount rate is 15%. So, in my opinion, investors will likely be well-compensated over the long term while holding Ubisoft. Still, I wouldn't consider Ubisoft a value play at these levels, either.
Conclusion
There's no denying that 1H 2019 has been incredibly challenging for Ubisoft. This is mostly explained by fewer games being published this year, plus apparent mistakes in the implementation of microtransactions. Nevertheless, during their last earnings call, management seemed to be aware of these mistakes. So, I remain optimistic about management's ability to not repeat these blunders.
Furthermore, this is evidenced by UBSFY pushing the release of a couple of major titles into 2020 for more development time. This shows the company's commitment to "getting it right" this time. Also, management seems to be willing to keep supporting and improving Ghost Recon Breakpoint. So, over the long term, it might become a revenue contributor as well. But more importantly, my valuation shows that the shares have some upside at these levels. Thus, as a whole, I think Ubisoft is a viable long-term investment in the gaming sector despite its recent missteps.
Thank you for reading, and good luck.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dev says MakerDAO attackers could turn $20M in Ethereum into $340M almost instantly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A software developer claims to have found a way in which to make an “incredibly profitable” but “expensive” attack to steal all the Ethereum available in MakerDAO.
Micah Zoltu described the potential attack in a blog post published on Monday, noting a successful attack could see the hacker “ride off into the sunset with $340 million worth of Ethereum.”
“The problem is, Maker Foundation has decided that the appropriate value for this governance delay is 0 seconds. That is right, defenders have 0 seconds to defend against an attack launched by a wealthy but malicious party,” he adds in the post.
The issue, Zoltu notes, lies in the way in which MakerDao is governed. “Some groups of plutocrats can control how the system behaves.”
In order to carry out the attack, the hacker would have to deploy approximately $20 million (40,000 MKR), which wouldn’t necessarily be straightforward. CoinDesk reports that the person would need to buy MKR without affecting the price, which is, of course, unlikely.
Zoltu claims Maker has been aware of the issue since before Maker v2 launched.
“Despite this, they are choosing not to plug the hole (the plug is easy). Because of that, I do not believe that it would be responsible for me to keep my mouth shut and hope that no attacker figures out what should be obvious to anyone who understands Maker’s governance model,” he notes.
Back in October, MakerDAO disclosed another dangerous security flaw that could have potentially allowed an attacker to steal Ethereum ETH powering its then-unreleased multi-collateral Dai with a single transaction. This could’ve done untold damage to the credibility of the MakerDAO system.
At the time, a HackerOne disclosure report revealed the attack was made possible due to the complete lack of access control in a MakerDAO smart contract, which allows the system to auction collateral in exchange for DAI cryptocurrency once loans are liquidated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FBI and US Marshals warn of heinous scammers demanding payments via Bitcoin ATMs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United States Marshals and Federal Bureau of Investigation don’t want you to forget about Bitcoin BTC scammers pretending to be people they’re not.
According to a tweet from late last week, the US Marshals has updated its warning about cryptocurrency scammers that coerce their victims to send them money through Bitcoin ATMs.
In the full update, US Marshals say that scammers call targets and attempt to collect a fine by claiming they have failed to report for jury duty.
Scammers then tell their targets that they can avoid arrest by depositing cash into a Bitcoin ATM, presumably with the funds being sent to the scammers. The perps also tell victims they can purchase prepaid debit cards or gift cards to satisfy the bogus fine.
According to the US Marshals, scammers will provide badge numbers, names of real law enforcement agents, and federal judges to sound credible. But these are nothing more than diversion tactics.
The US Marshals also say the scammers spoof their phone numbers to make them appear as if they are calling from a legitimate government number.
It’s unclear if the US Marshals’ update comes in response to an uptick in reported crimes of this nature. However, its full update does say that, in November, scammers had demanded victims deposit money via Bitcoin ATMs.
This is hardly a new strategy for cryptocurrency con artists, though.
In October last year, Hard Fork reported that fraudsters had been targeting Australian immigrants, saying that they needed to pay a tax or else they would risk deportation. Like this instance, scammers urged victims to pay via Bitcoin ATMs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Netflix uses psychology to perfect their customer experience</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If there’s a company that’s synonymous with seamless customer experience, it’s Netflix. It has become the defacto entertainment source for many. So much so that 15 percent of the world’s web traffic goes to Netflix.
But when your experience is industry-leading, how do you evolve it without disappointing customers? The answer lies in experimentation, built on proven psychological principles.
And because Netflix is a subscription service, you can quickly discover what’s working. Just observe how many customers cancel their service in response to your experiment and optimize from there.
Reciprocity is a social norm of responding to a positive action with another positive action. It’s why you feel indebted when someone does you a favor.
Made famous by Robert Cialdini in his book “Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,” Reciprocity can be summed by the saying, “You‘ve got to give to get.”
How does Netflix apply the Reciprocity Principle?
Netflix asked their customer base, “ What one thing would you like to know more about before signing up for Netflix?” The most popular answer (46 percent of responses) was “knowing all of the movies and TV shows available.”
In response, Netflix experimented with showing customers available content on the home page. But their experiment revealed something interesting. Showing customers too much of the content was distracting. Many of them browsed but never signed up.
Failed Experiment: Let customers browse Netflix’s complete catalog
So Netflix redesigned their experiment. Designers still used the Reciprocity Principle, but this time they used an image that hinted at an extensive catalog. But they didn’t let customers browse the whole thing.
Giving people a sneak peek — but not the total view — made customers more likely to sign up for a free streaming trial.
Winning Experiment: Give customers a sneak peek of the content
The Cocktail Party Effect states that people like to focus on information that’s relevant to them. But the Cocktail Party Effect also proves that if we go deeper, relevant content can drive incredible results.
In a recent study, Accenture found three personalization tactics that have a direct effect on buying behavior:
How to apply the Cocktail Party Effect to your experience
Netflix describes itself as “customer-obsessed” and strives to deliver a totally personalized experience. Their “Because you watched…” category is a prime example of this philosophy in action.
More than 80 percent of Netflix shows customers watched in the last two years have been as a direct result of Netflix’s recommendation engine. Not someone searching for a specific piece of content.
Recent studies into psychology, happiness, and customer experience have uncovered a principle called “Idleness Aversion.” It states that people are happier when they are busier, even if they’re forced to be busy.
How to apply Idleness Aversion to your experience
To keep people busy, give them information to engage with — animation, gamification, and visuals are ideal.
Netflix applies Idleness Aversion in an interesting way. Their experience forces you to watch trailers that auto-play when you dwell on the title.
This feature is a source of frustration for many customers, but the benefits of Idleness Aversion have clearly outweighed the costs for Netflix.
In the past decade, the Netflix site has undergone an incredible transformation. These changes and optimization were made possible because of a design culture built on the principles of “test and learn.”
Navin Iyengar, Lead Product Designer, described the Netflix testing philosophy this way (source):
It’s clear that a culture of experimentation is critical for psychological principles to be tested and optimized.
There’s no magic button you can press to make your brand experiment-driven. It’s a tough process that requires designers to work closely with marketing, product, IT, operations, and other digital teams.
But, if implemented correctly, the potential upside is huge. So instead of asking if you should focus on testing, the better question is, “How can we prioritize it?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus finally ditches its terrible TV remote for a new design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In September, weeks before launching its first TV, OnePlus‘ CEO Pete Lau tweeted the picture of its remote. The design confused the hell out of me. It had volume buttons on the side like a smartphone, and no mute button.
At a OnePlus briefing days later, I got to use the remote, and it didn’t change my opinion. It was clunky and didn’t work half the time. Also, its buttons and functions were terribly confusing.
The company is finally fixing it with a new design that has dedicated buttons for YouTube and Netflix in addition to Amazon Prime. As you can see in the picture below, the volume buttons are on the front, and there’s now a mute button on the top-right corner as well.
The company said it’ll start shipping a new batch of TVs in India with new remotes and a dedicated Netflix app, which was missing in the previous batches. Hopefully, the remote performs better than the previous iteration.
If you’re a user with the old version of the remote, you can get a new updated version here for free.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!
Ahh, December. On one hand, it’s a terrible month. It’s cold, it’s dark, it rains all the fucking time — it’s pretty grim when you think about it. But, on the other, it’s glorious.
There’s a festive cheer in the air, holidays are on the horizon, and people actually seem to want to meet up and have fun. And then you have the indulgences. My god, the indulgences.
The drink flows. Food’s everywhere. I’m salivating just thinking about it. It’s magnificent.
But… it can be too easy to go a bit too hard. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t eat that seventh turkey sandwich of the day, but maybe you could go for a little jog to help burn it off?
“Sounds good, but how can I motivate myself to do this?” I hear you ask.
Well, I’ve got a solution for you: a Fibit Versa 2 smartwatch. Oh — and would you believe it? — there’s currently $70 off this device! That means you can pick up the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch for only $130, instead of the $200 it normally costs.
Want some info? Well, first off, why don’t you have a look at this video from Fitbit:
As you’d expect from a device from Fitbit, the Versa 2 has all the health tracking features you could want. It can measure your heart rate, get real-time readouts on your activities, track your sleep, and more. Hell, you can ever swim with this thing!
But it’s the range of other features that really makes the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch such a steal for $130. Beyond all its health-tracking capabilities, it’s also a rather handy, uh, smartwatch.
The display has an always-on mode so you can constantly keep track of the time. You can control music from the device easily, and you can also pay for things with the device.
Basically, for $130, the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch is an amazingly advanced bit of kit. Whether you want to use it to get into shape, or give someone you love an awesome Christmas present, you should pick it up for $130 while you still can.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus might finally introduce a mid-range phone next year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OnePlus has increasingly grown every year with better and more flagship models. But with that growth, prices of their phones have increased too. The company hasn’t released a mid-range phone since launching the OnePlus X in 2015.
However, this might change next year. A bunch of renders published by 91mobiles in partnership with OnLeaks suggest the company will release a OnePlus 8 ‘lite’ in 2020.
The renders indicate the phone will have a punch-hole display – 6.4-inch or 6.5-inch – on the front, and a dual-camera setup with a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor on the back.
The report remarks the phone will have a USB-C port for charging, in-display fingerprint sensor to unlock the device, and no headphone jack.
It’s important to note that the company’s ‘cheapest’ phone, the OnePlus 7, this year cost more than $450. Its rival, Xiaomi, released a very competitive K20 Pro with a price tag of under $400. So it won’t be surprising if OnePlus releases a sub-$400 phone the next year.
It would be interesting to see if OnePlus will launch three models – the OnePlus 8 ‘lite’, the OnePlus 8, and the OnePlus 8 Pro – next year. With Realme rising in ranks, mid-range phone space is going to be really contentious.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy A (2020) series could employ MediaTek’s high-end 5G solution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung’s Galaxy A (2020) lineup, or at least some models from the upcoming series, could be equipped with MediaTek’s Dimensity 1000 5G chipset, according to a report by BGR.inciting industry sources from Taiwan.
Readers might recall that Samsung was reportedly trying to supply Chinese OEMs including OPPO and Vivo with its own 5G solutions earlier in the year. But the tables have turned, according to this fresh report. OPPO and Vivo are now both rumored to plan on acquiring the Dimensity 1000 5G chip from MediaTek, and interestingly enough, Samsung could do the same for its Galaxy A (2020) series.
While some Galaxy A (2020) devices like the Galaxy A71 5G could end up carrying the Exynos 980 chipset with an integrated 5G modem, this won’t be the case across the entire lineup. The recent report suggests that at least some models could rely on MediaTek’s flagship-grade 5G solution instead. It doesn’t mention where the existing Exynos Modem 5100 would fit into this new picture. Would it fade into obscurity while MediaTek’s 5G chip will take center stage?
In theory, there should be room for both chipsets to coexist. Some Galaxy A (2020) 5G models would presumably adopt the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 5G chip, while other, lower-end models could make use of Samsung’s own Exynos Modem 5100, or Qualcomm’s solutions.
As for the Dimensity 1000 5G chip, it was manufactured on a 7nm process (the Exynos Modem 5100 is based on 10nm FinFET) and delivers impressive on-paper figures, such as 4.7Gbps maximum downlink speeds. This technically makes it over two times faster than the Exynos Modem 5100 solution which can achieve maximum downlink speeds of 2Gpbs.
We are unable to confirm the validity of this rumor at this point, so take it with a pinch of salt. But assuming that there’s some truth to it, what would you say if Samsung would turn to MediaTek for 5G solutions? Do you think the Dimensity 1000 5G chip would be a good fit for the Galaxy A (2020) series? Share your thoughts below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Pay launched in just one new market in 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Among all the first-party Samsung apps and services, Samsung Pay, the company’s mobile payment service, is by far the most useful and popular. It is one of those few offerings where the Korean tech giant has done a better job than Google both in terms of technology and execution. In fact, it’s a major differentiating factor today for many customers who choose Galaxy smartphones over other brands in the market.
Samsung Pay made its debut on the Galaxy S6 lineup and Note 5 in August 2015 in South Korea. Since then, the company has brought the service to more markets and expanded the list of supported devices. Yet, at the end of 2019, the service is still a niche offering with availability in around two dozen markets and the full Samsung Pay experience limited to mostly flagship devices.
The pace of Samsung Pay rollout seems to have dropped significantly in 2019, with Indonesia being the only new market added this year. Even on the supported devices front, the MST technology which differentiates Samsung Pay from other mobile payment solutions in the market is still limited mostly to flagship models. The company does offer Samsung Pay Mini on many of its budget and mid-range devices, but it’s not as useful or versatile as the MST-based Samsung Pay.
However, in select markets where the service is already available, Samsung did add many new features such as international transfers, third-party wallet integrations, virtual prepaid card, etc. It also launched Samsung POS to turn Samsung Pay-compatible phones into payment terminals for small businesses. But, once again, many of these new features are available in a handful of markets, limiting their reach.
There is a sense that Samsung is no longer hyping its mobile payment service with the same intensity and frequency it used to do earlier. Whether this is because the company has turned less ambitious about Samsung Pay or due to general fatigue, we don’t know. Either way, it’s not a good sign for those who regularly use and love the service.
We have reached out to Samsung for a comment on what appears to be a slowdown in the rollout of Samsung Pay. We will update the post if we hear back from the company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No Android 10/One UI 2.0 beta program coming for the Galaxy Fold</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the least surprising news of the day, Samsung has confirmed that there will be no One UI 2.0 beta program for the Galaxy Fold, its company’s costliest mobile device in the market right now. The confirmation comes via the company’s community forums in Korea, where it was also revealed that the Galaxy Note 10’s stable Android 10 update will come out “soon”, with no other specifics given.
Galaxy Fold not getting access to an Android 10 beta to test out the new version of the OS is in line with how Samsung has treated its foldable device as far as software updates are concerned, especially the 5G-enabled variant. The Fold has constantly been playing catch-up in both security and feature updates compared to the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy S10. Even the Android 10 update for the Fold has been scheduled for April, a full three months after the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 if we go by Samsung’s official roadmap.
Of course, the considerably lower sales figures and limited availability of the Galaxy Fold probably have to do with Samsung’s decision to not start a beta program for it, despite how high the foldable phone’s price may be. It’s also unclear just how many Fold owners would be willing to install beta software on it, and we can only hope Samsung will at least introduce some functionality that takes advantage of the foldable form factor with the Fold’s Android 10 update in return for making us wait so long for the update to come out.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 3.5mm headphone jack is surely being phased out, and wireless solutions are likely to increase in popularity as a result. But even if this wasn’t the case, wireless headphones are a better fit for an active lifestyle and for people who enjoy fitness activities. They don’t get in the way as much, and although some products in this category can get rather expensive, others won’t burn a hole in your pocket. Case in point, this pair of wireless headphones now available for 48% off provides plenty of features for the buck, including CVC6.0 noise cancellation, a sweat-proof build, and up to 6 hours of music playback on a single charge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Malia’s next music video to be filmed solely with Samsung mobile cameras</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a bid to promote some of its latest Galaxy products and ecosystem, Samsung Brazil is teaming up with Jazz singer Malia who will film her next music video using only Samsung products instead of professional cameras and equipment.
The music video will be created using the Galaxy Tab S6 and Galaxy Note 10+, but other devices like the Galaxy Watch Active 2, the Galaxy Buds, and the AKG N700NC headphones will also be a part of the production process.
In essence, the camera setup will consist of a 16MP ultrawide sensor and two 12MP wide and telephoto shooters (Galaxy Note 10+), as well as a 13MP wide and 5MP ultrawide sensor (Galaxy Tab S6). Evidently, it’s not all about megapixels, and underlying technologies such as Super Steady recording on the Galaxy Note 10+ will play a role as well.
While the subject matter is different, it does seem like Samsung doesn’t want to be outshined by Apple and its latest ‘Shot on iPhone’ ad campaign. However, it could be argued that Samsung is pushing things one step further, as Apple’s ads are just that: ads shot on iPhones by professional filmmakers, whereas Samsung Brazil and Malia will create a full-fledged music video using only Galaxy products.
Samsung Brazil didn’t reveal exactly when we can expect the music video to be released, but it could be done by the end of the year. It will be very interesting to see how this creation will compare to Apple’s ads, even if the approach is relatively different.
Last week we also reported on Samsung Indonesia’s Galaxy Movie Studio educational platform meant to teach aspiring filmmakers how to hone their craft and create quality content using smartphones instead of professional equipment. This seems to be a common theme nowadays, and it might become even more prevalent next year as Samsung seemingly intends on pushing the Galaxy S11 series’ camera configuration to new heights with 8K video recording and more.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung has released the December 2019 security update for the Galaxy A5 (2017), Galaxy J5 (2017), Galaxy A8 (2018), and Tab A 10.5 in select regions. The company has been rather quick so far in pushing the latest monthly patch to many of its devices, so much so that it kickstarted the rollout even before the same update is available for Google’s Pixel devices.
The update is probably limited to security fixes and unlikely to bring any new features to these non-flagship models. As usual, the December patch includes security fixes for dozens of vulnerabilities in the core Android OS and Samsung customizations on top of it. You can read our article based on Samsung’s monthly security bulletin to know more about the nature and severity of some of these risks.
The December update for the Galaxy A5 (2017) is rolling out widely in many regions such as Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, Poland, Peru, Brazil, etc., while the Galaxy J5 (2017) is receiving the same on all the major carriers in South Korea. The Galaxy A8 (2018), meanwhile, is getting the update in Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Canada, and Russia. Lastly, the release for the Galaxy Tab A 10.5 is currently out in Switzerland, Netherlands, Baltic, and United Kingdom.
If you own any of these devices and stay in these regions, you should be receiving the OTA update notification automatically. You can also manually check for it by going into Settings and tapping the Download updates manually option under the Software Update menu. Alternatively, you can also consider flashing the latest firmware manually. If you intend to do so, click here, here, here, and here to download the latest firmware for these devices.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Upcoming Galaxy A51 will get quarterly security updates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even though the Galaxy A51 is yet to go official, Samsung has listed the device in its Android security update bulletin and scheduled it for quarterly security updates. Yes, the Galaxy A51, despite being a newer device, is set to get a security update every three months while the Galaxy A50 is on a monthly schedule.
However, it’s possible the Galaxy A51 will get monthly updates despite what Samsung’s official schedule might say. The Galaxy A50 was also slated to get quarterly security updates at launch, but Samsung released a new update for the device every month in most markets and officially shifted it to monthly updates later on. The Galaxy A51 will hopefully get similar support once it goes on sale, which should be sometime later this month following the phone’s official unveiling on December 12.
Even if the Galaxy A51 doesn’t get monthly updates, those who purchase the device will be able to enjoy the latest version of Android out of the box. The Galaxy A50’s Android 10 update is currently slated to come out sometime in April, along with a number of other 2019 Galaxy A series phones. The Galaxy A51 will also be eligible to get Android 12, while the Galaxy A50 will end its life on Android 11 unless Samsung changes its long-standing policy of only providing two major OS updates to every Galaxy device.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi makes foray into Japanese market</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi Corp., the world’s fourth-largest maker of smartphones, is entering the Japanese market, embarking on a quest to win the hearts of iPhone-loving Japanese consumers.
Though late in joining the game, the timing may end up working well for the Beijing-based firm known for producing cost-effective electronics, as the Japanese mobile phone market has been undergoing some changes due to regulations implemented in October that could be disadvantageous for high-priced premium handsets.
“Xiaomi is finally entering Japan,” Steven Wang, general manager of Xiaomi in East Asia, said during a news conference in Tokyo on Monday.
Xiaomi, which has entered more than 90 markets worldwide, said it started taking orders online Monday for the Mi Note 10 smartphone series, Xiaomi’s latest high-end model equipped with five camera lenses and a monstrous 108-megapixel image sensor. Shipments will start later this month.
The Mi Note 10 and the Mi Note 10 Pro will be priced at ¥52,800 and ¥64,800, respectively, the company said.
Other than online sales, Wang did not provide sales channel details, such as whether it plans to sell them via Japanese carriers.
Xiaomi has established itself as one of the leading smartphone brands globally in less than a decade since its inception in 2010.
According to market research firm IDC, Xiaomi’s global market share was 9.1 percent as of the third quarter of this year, while Samsung Electronics Co. held 21.8 percent, Huawei Technologies Co. 18.6 percent and Apple Inc. 13 percent.
But the Japanese market has a different power balance, as Apple’s iPhones are hugely popular here.
In the first half of fiscal 2019, Apple’s smartphone share in Japan overwhelmed rivals with 44.6 percent, followed by Sharp Corp.’s 12.3 percent and Samsung’s 10.2 percent.
Some market watchers say Xiaomi, founded and run by Lei Jun — called China’s Steve Jobs — may have a tough time winning the hearts of iPhone users in Japan.
Yet the timing may also provide Xiaomi a good chance to grab a piece of the pie, as Japan’s smartphone market has seen some drastic changes in recent months because of pressure from the government to reduce data usage fees by facilitating competition.
The government has made it mandatory for carriers to clearly separate data fees and handset prices to enable users to see what they are paying for. It also ordered carriers to slash cancellation fees on two-year contracts to ¥1,000 from around ¥9,500.
The new rules also cap handset discounts at ¥20,000 to avoid excessive price cuts going to only certain devices.
This is where Xiaomi apparently wants to swoop in with its cost-effective smartphones, as the Mi Note 10 models cost roughly half of the latest iPhone models.
“We think that our value-for-money business model can bring big changes to the Japanese market,” said Wang.
The firm declared last year that it will cap its net profit margin from hardware products to 5 percent. Wang said Xiaomi can still make a profit due to economies of scale in addition to its internet businesses.
Xiaomi will roll out some nonsmartphone products in Japan this month, as well, including a smart wearable device and a rice cooker, he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It seemed too good to be true when Samsung started rolling out the Android 10 update for the Galaxy S10 series a couple of weeks back, a full month before the year ends. We have been using Android 10 on one of our Galaxy S10+ units and have found it to be pretty stable, and our readers from various countries have also found it to work pretty well.
However, it seems a few serious bugs slipped through in the update that was released in Israel, as Samsung has halted its rollout in the country. We can confirm that the update is no longer being rolled out in Israel. According to one of our readers from the country, Samsung customer support is not giving any specific details and is only saying that a new update will be released soon.
It’s possible the bugs that are affecting the update are specific to the devices sold in Israel/Israeli carriers, as the same Android 10 build was released in every market and there haven’t been any reports of any major issues in the update from other countries. We’ll keep an eye on the situation and let you know as soon as we hear anything, and you can also tell us in the comments if you have run into any issues on your Galaxy S10 after updating to Android 10.
Thanks for the tip, neorai!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Existence of the remasters seemingly leaked last week, but now Sega has made it official – the Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle is coming to Xbox One and PS4 early next year! This is the first time these two Platinum Games classics have been available on Microsoft and Sony’s current consoles (both came to PC in 2017 and Bayo hit Switch in 2018). These new remastered ports of the games will run in 4K at 60fps on both the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X.
Here’s a bit more detail about what the Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle includes:

The Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle will set you back 40 bucks. There’s no official word on whether you’ll be able to purchase the games separately, but, as mentioned, an individual store listing for Vanquish did leak last week, so it seems likely you’ll be able to pick and choose if you're buying digitally.
The Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle brings the action to Xbox One and PS4 on February 18, 2020. Are you going to be grabbing the games again, or perhaps trying them for the first time?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Executives Jailed For Two Years Following $3.9 Billion Fraud Case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Korean tech giant Samsung is no stranger to controversy. The company faced sharp criticism for flagship product failures and its executives have also found themselves on the wrong side of the law. Samsung's top executive, Mr. Lee Jae-Yong has seen trouble in courts as well, after he was released on probation in February last year. Now, three executives of Samsung Electronics have been sentenced for up to two years by the Seoul District Court in South Korea following accusations of ordering employees of Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd (KRX:207940) to conduct financial impropriety.
In June this year, prosecutors in Seoul, the South Korean capital, summoned Mr. Chung Hyun-Ho to question him regarding accounting fraud at the chaebol's biotech arms, Samsung BioLogics (KRX:207940) and Samsung Bioepis. The summoning proceeded after authorities raided a Samsung BioLogics factory in May and uncovered a trove of electronic devices involved in an accounting coverup that took place in 2015.
Samsung Might Use MediaTek 5G Chips in Some Mid-Range Galaxy Devices
Mr. Ho is a close associate of Mr. Jae-Yong, and the coverup at Samsung's biotechnological affiliates amounts to $3.9 billion. Samsung Bioepis is a subsidiary of Samsung BioLogics, and investigators found devices including laptops and a server hidden under the floor of the company's meeting room.
The executives are involved in inflating the value of Samsung Bioepis by $3.9 billion in a move to boost Mr. Jae-yong's control of Samsung Electronics. The executive is currently Samsung's vice-chairman and is the son of the chaebol's chairman Mr. Lee Kun-hee. Samsung's mobile division, Samsung Mobile has been feeling the heat recently as it struggles to compete with Huawei in China. Troubles in the smartphone world have also led Samsung to discontinue designing custom cores for its in-house smartphone processors. Samsung's Mongoose CPU cores have failed to keep with strong performance and impressive power consumption offered by competitors from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
The fraud, investigators believe, was conducted to bolster the value of Cheil Industries by inflating Samsung Bioepis' worth. Cheil Industries was the parent company of Bioepis in 2015 and was nearing a merger with Samsung C&T. Mr. Jae-yong, at the time, had a 1% share in Samsung Electronics and a 23% stake in Cheil. By falsely overvaluing Samsung Bioepis, the executives seemingly helped Samsung's heir-apparent gain a larger stake in Samsung Electronics, since Samsung C&T held a key position in the group, and by merging Cheil with Samsung C&T, the executive would in effect be able to exert influence on Samsung Electronics.
Samsung BioLogics (KRX:207940) is listed on the Korea exchange; the only securities exchange in South Korea. The company reported 78 billion Korean Won in revenue this June, and it is currently trading for a share price of 388,000 Won on the Korean exchange, down by 1.77% from yesterday's closing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Windows 10 v1909: Would Microsoft Deliver More Easy-to-Install Updates Like the November 2019 Update?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Windows maker introduced the November 2019 Update or version 1909 last month. Unlike the previous editions, this Windows 10 feature update was delivered as an enablement package, which meant it took less time and was less disruptive during the installation process.
The release, however, made many question if this is going to be the future strategy for Microsoft: deliver one mega feature update in spring and a second one in fall that is smaller in size and focuses entirely on performance and stability of the operating system instead of new features.
Second Windows 10 Version 2004 Build 19037.1 Drops This Week – For Both Slow & Fast Rings
Microsoft finally managed to get out of the rut of delivering flawed updates that seemed to introduce more issues than they were fixing. With the release of the November 2019 Update, the company focused entirely on performance and didn't aim to introduce any new major features. This ensured that the version 1909 didn't cause any issues or broke any features.
Since the introduction of Windows 10 in 2015, both Home and business users have complained about dealing with two major releases every year. The process takes a bit of time and becomes even more disruptive when you add in the compatibility issues that are difficult to get rid of in the Windows ecosystem.
With the release of version 1909, many are hoping that this service pack style of updates would become a norm. In a discussion on Mixer (via ghacks), Microsoft finally touched on the topic. When asked if we will see a "more minor feature update in H2," the company said that there is no formal plan, but the feedback from version 1909 could influence future plans.
Windows 10 November 2019 Update is basically an add-on for May 2019 Update. It focuses entirely on addressing issues, optimizations, stability, and performance improvements.
Microsoft has already internally finalized Windows 10 version 2004 (20H1 branch), which is currently being tested by both the Fast and Slow rings. The company will soon begin testing version 20H2, which will confirm whether the company adopts this new service pack style for the H2 updates or not.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Price Target Set At $342 As Analyst Speculates On Apple Glasses In 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the holiday season around the corner, Cupertino tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gearing up for its first quarter 2020 earnings. The company's iPhone sales have not been able to maintain growth and to counter this, Apple is working hard to encourage customers to purchase other products and services. The strategy displayed effect in Apple's fiscal year 2019, as Services and Wearables grew by $6.5 billion and $7.1 billion over the year's course.
The company's stock, for its part, has soared. Afer Apple hit a fresh one year high last month, the stock has once crossed the boundary last week. Additionally, China's Renaissance Bank has started coverage on the company's stock, with analyst Jason Son claiming that Apple is working on augmented reality glasses.
China Fires Another Salvo as the Trade War Kicks into High Gear – Orders Government Offices to Purge Western Tech
Since October 24th, Apple's stock has crossed the 52-week (or one year) high barrier thirteen times. The tech index has been doing well too, as Microsoft Corporation and Alphabet Inc continuing to soar alongside Apple. At the time of writing, Apple is trading at $269.57, down by 0.42% over yesterday's closing. The stock broke its previous 52-week high of $267.98 on Friday when it touched $270.71.
Wall Street, for its part, is bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with analysts continually revising price estimates. Apple, according to banks and research firms, is undervalued. Reports from the company's supply chain have suggested that products such as the AirPods and iPhone 11 are proving very popular.
Today's price target by Jason Son, however, beats investment banks from the United States. The analyst, working for China's Renaissance Bank, has set Apple's price target at $342; 25 five times the company's price-to-earnings estimate.
Son states that this target is based on Apple's service being stronger than their counterparts in China, with a stable user base growth indicating that the company can earn more revenue from both new and old customers. While iPhone revenues fell in Apple's fiscal year 2019, its user base grew by 45 million in the year. The Chinese analyst is also optimistic about the iPhone maker's current hardware portfolio, as he believes that the iPhone will improve in the future due to its dominance in the flagship smartphone spectrum.
More importantly, Son believes that will launch its first augmented reality glasses next year. The product, if launched, will be Apple's latest addition to wearables. So far, no tech giant has successfully launched such glasses for everyday users. With the gadget, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have an advantage over its competitors as the company will be able to successfully integrate it with existing iOS (and hopefully macOS) devices. I have speculated in some depth on Apple's plans for the Apple Glasses here after it made key management shifts in early November.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NVIDIA Registers Hopper GPU Trademark – A Next Generation MCM GPU?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The folks over at Videocardz have verified a rumor we published almost a month back about NVIDIA's upcoming GPU, called Hopper. This is now no longer a rumor and strictly in leak territory, although the only thing confirmed at this point is the codename: Hopper. I will say this right at the start that its possible Hopper is not an MCM GPU. But considering the older rumor correctly predicted the trademark, it is now likely that the rest of the story is true as well. Interestingly, NVIDIA also trademarked another codename called Aerial. The trademarks surfaced over at the US Patent and Trademark Office.
NVIDIA can use MCM technology to truly revolutionize the world of GPUs and bring forth a GPU that is so powerful that no conventional, monolithic die-based GPU, would be able to come within spitting distance of the thing. It is also the next step in GPU evolution (more on that below). Without any further ado, here is the official trademark filed by NVIDIA which confirms the existence of the GPU:
NVIDIA's architectures are always based on computer pioneers and this one appears to be no different. Nvidia's Hopper architecture is based on Grace Hopper, who was one of the pioneers of computer science and one of the first programmers of Harvard Mark 1, and also the inventor of the first linkers. She also popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL - an early high-level programming language still in use today. She enlisted in the Navy and helped the American War efforts during World War II.
An MCM-based design is arguably the next step in GPU evolution considering we are now being limited by the reticle size of most EUV scanners. Architectural improvements and MCM-design is the next logical frontier, and since AMD has already executed on it on the CPU front, it makes sense that GPUs would be the next step in their grand plan - which would explain why NVIDIA would want to get a headstart on it all and beat them to the punch. The leak occurred from a well-known twitter account and the tweets have since been deleted but not before the Twitterati caught it and posted about it (over at 3DCenter.org).
AMD has already proven itself to be exceptionally good at creating MCM based products. The Threadripper and Ryzen series has been absolutely disruptive to the HEDT market space. They single-handedly turned what was usually a 6-core and very expensive affair to a 16 core affordable combo using an MCM package. The power of servers and Xeons was finally in the hands of average consumers, so why can't the same philosophy work for GPUs as well? I am sure you already know that NVIDIA can use the MCM-philosophy to beat the reticle size of scanners and build truly monstrous GPUs exceeding a net surface area of 1000mm² but are there other advantages as well?Well, theoretically speaking, it should work better in all regards for GPUs which are parallel devices than for CPUs which are serial devices. Not only that but you are looking at massive yield gains from just shifting to an MCM based approach instead of a monolithic die. A single huge die has abysmal yields, is expensive to produce and usually has high wastage. Multiple chips totaling the same die size would offer yield increases straight of the bat. This is a great argument in favor of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU.
I took the liberty to do some rough approximations using the lovely Silicon Edge tool and was not surprised to see instant yield gains. Taking a die measuring 484mm² (eg: Vega 64) which equates to a die measuring 22mm by 22mm. Splitting this monolithic die into 4x 11mm by 11mm gives you the same net surface area  (484mm²) and will also result in yield gains. How much? Let's see. According to the approximation, a 300mm wafer should be able to produce 114 monolithic dies (22x22) or 491 smaller dies (11x11). Since we need 4 smaller dies to equal 1 monolithic part, we end up with 122 484mm² MCM dies. That's a yield gain of 7.6% right there.
The yield gains are even larger for bigger chips. The upper limit of lithographic techniques (with reasonable yields) is roughly 815mm². On a single 300mm wafer, we can get about 64 of these (28.55x28.55) or 285 smaller dies (14.27x14.27). That gives us a total of 71 MCM based dies for a yield increase of roughly 11%. Now full disclosure, this is a very rough approximation and does not take into account several factors such as packaging yields, rectangular die and other shape-based optimization of the wafer etc but the basic idea holds well. Conversely, it also does not take into account increased gains by lowered wastage - a faulty 815mm² monolithic die is much more wasteful than a single 203mm² one! This means this approach has the added benefit of minimizing the impact of defective dies - which will add on to these yield numbers once you factor in unusable dies.
Long story short, NVIDIA is perfectly capable of creating an MCM based GPU and would even get some serious yield benefits out of this if it chooses to run with this for Hopper GPUs. Considering the 7nm node is now entering a mature stage with EUV, etches are going to be very clear and should be able to support a concept like this with ease but are still limited by the reticle size. Switching to an MCM based design would allow NVIDIA to build monstrous GPUs with a net die size of more than 815mm² (the sky is the limit with MCM - as AMD has proven)! So if it wants to continue on its non-linear performance increase trend that has made it so successful, it might not have any other option but to adopt this.
What do you think of the MCM GPU philosophy?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Red Dead Redemption 2 is far from being the most difficult game around, so if you are looking for a challenge, you won't find it there. Unless you use a mod that has been released recently which allows for some changes to the game's difficulty.
The Difficulty Scaler mod allows players to change the damage values for all weapons for both player and AI enemies. The mod is quite easy to use and features controls that allow players to revert back to vanilla settings with a hotkey.

More information on the Difficulty Scaler mod can be found on Nexus Mods.
Red Dead Redemption 2 has been released last month on the Epic Games Store and last week on Steam. The PC version of the game is rather demanding, as Keith stated in his performance analysis.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC as well as on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Low-Res Galaxy S11 Live Images Pay Close Attention to Large Rear-Mounted Camera Hump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A group of Galaxy S11 live images have allegedly surfaced, but you’ll be a bit disappointed to know that these aren’t the average high-quality photographs that you’ll enjoy staring into. Regardless, the latest leak provides valuable insight into the design of the upcoming flagship, as well as focusing on that extremely large rear camera hump.
The track record of Ice Universe is decent enough to know that these Galaxy S11 live images could be the real deal when talking about a proper commercial product that the masses could eventually use on a daily basis. After all, the earlier shared CAD renders of the flagship also revealed that large rear camera hump with multiple cameras and over here, we can see the same thing, though the images are extremely grainy to notice other details.
Samsung’s Galaxy S11+ Could Come With a Custom 108MP Camera for Enhanced Image Quality
While the quality of these Galaxy S11 live images is not up to par with what you normally view on the internet, the rumored specifications and features of the entire camera array is very impressive, at least according to what we’ve heard so far. For starters, one report claims that the upcoming handset will sport Samsung’s 108MP camera sensor coupled with 5x optical zoom. The Korean giant is late to the party in adopting a higher zoom value for its flagship smartphones, but better late than never right?
Also, thanks to the Galaxy S11 specifications including the Snapdragon 865 or Exynos 990, depending on where you live, the flagship should have enough firepower to record 8K video at 30FPS. Sadly, thanks to both images being pixelated beyond the rear camera hump, it’s difficult to notice what other design aspects Samsung has changed. Even if we attempt to speculate, there would be no point until high-resolution pictures are released in the open, which we have a feeling they will, so have a little patience.
That being said, we should expect better quality Galaxy S11 live images to come forth before the rumored February 2020 unveiling kicks off. It wouldn’t be surprising to know nearly everything about the flagship lineup before all models are officially launched, so stay tuned for more updates.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new Crash Bandicoot may be announced very soon, as some recent happenings suggest.
YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh spotted several influencers posting photos of a figurine from the Crash Bandicoot series they have received recently. Last year, something similar happened right before the announcement of Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, so it is very likely that an announcement related to the series is coming at The Game Awards or even earlier during this week's State of Play from Sony.

The latest entry in the series to be released on consoles is the already mentioned Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled. The game doesn't break any new ground, but it does a great job of updating the formula.
A new Crash Bandicoot game has yet to be announced officially. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.

The Elder Scrolls Legends was supposed to launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, but this announcement seems to suggest it won't happen anymore.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Just weeks until WhatsApp will stop working on these phone models</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Owners of older mobile phones have been warned their handsets will no longer be able to operate WhatsApp in a matter of weeks.
Earlier this month, the company behind the popular messaging platform announced the app would not work on many phones as early as December 31. 
The move will be completed by February 1, reports Wales Online, meaning people with Windows models and old iPhones will be frozen out.
A WhatsApp spokesman said: “As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use.”
The full list of phones affected and the date they will (or did) stop supporting WhatsApp
• Nokia Symbian S60 after June 30, 2017
• BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 after December 31, 2017
• Nokia S40 after December 31, 2018
• All Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019
• Android versions 2.3.7 and older after February 1, 2020
• iPhone iOS 7 and older after February 1, 2020
A WhatsApp spokesman said: “While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.
"This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.”
“If you use one of these affected mobile devices, we recommend upgrading to a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone to continue using WhatsApp.”
Phones affected by the changes include iPhones with versions of iOS older than 7, as well as Android devices running on version 2.3.7.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Facebook’s business strategy for the future: Conversational commerce</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Facebook‘s Commerce Partnerships Director for APAC, Christine Chia, explains that commerce has evolved over the years—it’s no longer about the single sale in that moment. Instead, it’s about building connections and relationships with customers.
At the APAC Press Day 2020. Facebook explained some of their plans for the future—including making moves in the commerce space.
In essence, Facebook’s plans to develop commerce for their part is centred around a combination of two things—conversational commerce. The Asia Pacific region, according to Facebook, is a growth driver with over a billion monthly active users.
The number of messages that were sent between businesses and people on Messenger on a monthly basis has doubled to 20 billion messages in 2019 (up from 8 billion in 2018), which points to a shift in the commerce landscape towards conversational commerce.
And this extends across Facebook’s family of apps: Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, and even WhatsApp. All of the apps function on a single unified commerce stack—which means that a there is cross-platform compatibility across the apps, with more functionality to follow.
A universal catalog is the key feature here, and Facebook says that this unified stack also helps to ensure brand safety. This is due to a combination of integrations into a single “commerce funnel”, with transactions and payments being eventually covered with Facebook Pay. This would mean one single integration that cuts across multiple surfaces.”
Unfortunately, Facebook Pay is still only available in the U.S., and the Facebook team doesn’t have any concrete news on when we might expect to see the feature in Malaysia, or even the region. This, according to Christine, is also due to the “hyper-local” nature of payments in certain regions.
Meanwhile, Facebook is also exploring the potential of Marketplace. At the present, Marketplace is more popular with classified used goods, and Facebook wants to evolve the platform to complement the goods already available on Marketplace with new retail goods. And according to Christine, that will be something that sets them apart from from other competitors in the region, such as Lazada or Shopee.
And that strategy is targeted towards helping micro-businesses grow, scale, and ultimately compete with larger, more established brands. That’s where the social element of Facebook’s approach comes in—customers become advocates for brands to grow.
That’s a key factor for Facebook when it comes to their approach. Coming into the commerce space, it seems that Facebook is aiming to leverage off the continued growth of micro-businesses and SMBs (small and mid-sized business), while banking on the “social” and communicative aspects of their platforms to provide something a little different.
A large part of this arguably hinges on the potential introduction of Facebook Pay. As mentioned earlier, having the entire process integrated within a single “funnel” reduces potential risks and dangers—some of the main obstacles to any e-commerce platform. And with Facebook saying that the Pay feature will work across all of their platforms, this will certainly open up a lot of opportunities.
Unfortunately, until further notice, we don’t have concrete details on that—not yet, anyways.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two expected Samsung Galaxy S11+ upgrades that would make power users happy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s not easy to introduce a new flagship smartphone every year. For 2020, Samsung appears to be going all out with significant upgrades on its upcoming Galaxy S11+. Ahead of its expected launch in Q1 2020, reliable leakster Ice Universe has dropped a couple of juicy details for the upcoming flagship smartphone.
In the camera department, the Galaxy S11+ is said to be incorporating a high-resolution 108MP image sensor. The sensor is quite huge at 1/1.3″, which is similar to the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro. Although the pixel count and sensor size is similar, Ice Universe has clarified that this is a custom sensor and it will be superior to the ISOCELL Bright HMX unit that’s currently used on Xiaomi’s new smartphone.
Since the Samsung Galaxy S11 series is a flagship, you can expect faster image processing and better AI-assistance in imaging, especially with a processor like the Snapdragon 865. For greater versatility, the upcoming device is speculated to feature a telephoto lens that can do 5X optical zoom.
It was reported earlier this year that Samsung’s camera department has started mass-producing 5x optical zoom camera modules. They had acquired Coreophotonics, a company that had previously worked with Oppo on a periscope camera system. The module is said to be 5mm thin which makes it ideal to be fitted onto a flagship smartphone without excessive protrusion.
Apart from photography, Ice Universe has shared a picture of what appears to be the battery cell of the Galaxy S11+ that comes with a huge 5,000mAh battery. As a comparison, the Galaxy Note 10+ has a 4,300mAh battery and even the Huawei Mate 30 Pro comes with a 4,500mAh unit.
Not only it would be sufficient to support 5G, the large battery is also said to be an indication that a fluid 120Hz refresh rate display might be offered on the upcoming S11+. Are you looking forward to the Galaxy S11 series? Let us know in the comments below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a free speech challenge brought by a trade group against a regulation issued by the California city of Berkeley that requires cell phone retailers to tell customers of certain radiation risks.
The justices left in place a July 2019 decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that refused to block the 2015 regulation that industry group CTIA appealed.
CTIA said the regulation violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects free speech rights, because the government, without the necessary justification that supports other types of regulations, is forcing retailers to spread a message they disagree with.
The 2015 regulation requires retailers to provider a notice to customers saying that carrying a cell phone can exceed Federal Communications Commission guidelines for exposure to radio-frequency radiation.
"If you carry or use your phone in a pants or shirt pocket or tucked into a bra when the phone is ON and connected to a wireless network, you may exceed the federal guidelines," the notice says.
CTIA disputed the content of the notice, saying it is misleading because the FCC has concluded that carrying a cell phone is safe.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk took Tesla's new Cybertruck out for a spin in Los Angeles on Saturday. During his drive, he took out a traffic pylon and made some other questionable driving decisions.
A video published by TMZ showed the billionaire mowing down a "right turn only" sign while turning left out of Nobu, a sushi restaurant in Malibu.
To be sure, the sign did not appear to be on the road and instead seemed to be private traffic management for the restaurant's parking lot, given that the driveway is next to a traffic light. In the video, the light turns green for cross-traffic as Musk exits the parking lot.
A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This appeared to be the Cybertruck's first voyage out on public roads following the electric pickup's unveiling in late November. A YouTube user named Roberto Cruz posted a video on Saturday evening of the mirrorless truck spotted on the 405 Freeway.
The truck appeared to have manufacturer license plates, which, according to The Driven, can be used for testing.
Nobu seemed to be more of a celebration for Musk following his win in a defamation suit brought by the diver he called a "pedo guy" on Twitter last year.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Government offices and public institutions in China have been ordered to replace foreign computers and software within three years, Financial Times reported on Monday (Dec. 9).
Dubbed as the “3-5-2” directive, the policy will see 30 percent of approximately 20-30 million items of hardware and software removed in 2020, 50 percent in 2021, and 20 percent in 2022. This is the first publicly known guideline aimed at decreasing China’s reliance on foreign technologies, the report said.
The move, which is likely to deal a blow to U.S. companies Dell and Microsoft, is regarded as a countermeasure to the restrictions imposed by Washington earlier this year on trade between American companies and Chinese tech giant Huawei, wrote The Guardian. In May, multinationals like Intel, Qualcomm, and Google announced they would sever ties with Huawei.
While it is viable to phase out foreign brand computers, analysts cast doubt on the possibility of swapping software with China’s own products. Most software developers make products compatible with U.S.-made operating systems, for example Apple’s macOS and Microsoft’s Windows, Financial Times suggested.
It could also prove a challenge to determine whether a product is made in China. Despite the fact that government offices like to use desktop computers from the Chinese-owned company Lenovo, its processor chips and hard drives are mostly manufactured by American or South Korean companies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turn Your Face Into a GIF With Snapchat Cameos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat is reportedly testing a feature that essentially lets users insert themselves into GIFs.
The social network’s video alternative to Bitmoji, Snapchat Cameos uses selfies to replace other people’s faces in animations.
Following a trial run in France, Snap today announced the Dec. 18 global launch of Cameos on iOS and Android, as reported by TechCrunch.
The news site’s Josh Constine got his hands on the forthcoming function, which turned his smiling face into a personalized meme.
“Snapchat has made 150 short looping video clips with sound that you can choose from with new ones coming each week,” he wrote in a blog post. “They can show you flaunting your cash, dancing like crazy, falling asleep, and tons more.”
Simply take a selfie to teach the app what you look like (try not to smile); Snap automatically applies your photo to actors’ heads in various GIFs.
Whether starring in your own looping animation or sharing the spotlight with friends (activate two-person Cameos), you can search for specific words and phrases or browse categories to find the right clip for the moment.
Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp have copied Snap’s Stories to great success.
But, as Constine pointed out, Snap may have taken its own Cameos inspiration from Chinese social platform Zao, which let users Deepfake their faces into videos.
In an effort to keep ahead of the chatting curve, Snapchat has begun monetizing messaging, and may even sell sponsored, branded Cameos clips to advertisers, TechCrunch said.
Snap did not immediately respond to Geek’s request for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Android, Google and free content licenses. Who is to blame and what can be done?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Have you heard about bans on apps and developers in Google Play? This is just such a story. It’s also an attempt to collect similar cases into one place and offer some kind of plan of action to prevent Google’s unpredictable actions. It isn’t fair to be banned for the legal use of free material. Personally, I like the idea of content licenses such as CC BY-SA, which permits any use, including commercial. Thanks to such licenses, we developers have websites like StackOverflow, where I’ve been elected to be the moderator. Unfortunately, companies like Google don’t respect the ideas behind these licenses. Here's my story.
It all started out fine. Our app for Android was created back in 2014 and had been living quite a normal life on Google Play. The app was a client to a site with texts. Nothing special, but people liked it, especially the option to download texts to the device and read them without the Internet. The app took the texts from http://scpfoundation.net/. It’s a website for joint literary creativity within a common fictional universe, quite well-known in some circles. Originally it appeared in the US (http://www.scp-wiki.net).Then their community translated thousands of articles from English into over 10 other languages. For posterity, it is important that all the content on the sites, the original and the translated ones, is distributed under a free Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which is located at the bottom of each page. This also applies to the logo of the website indicating the license, as seen here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SCP_Foundation_ (emblem).svg on Wikipedia. The license permits any use of the material, including for commercial purposes, requiring only the indication of authorship and preservation of the original license in derivative works. This information, the source of the texts with license indication, was in both the description of the apps and in the apps themselves.
For several years everything was running normally. Initially, it was decided to make all the features of the app free and to provide the possibility of voluntary donations through in-app subscriptions. However, it hardly brought in any profit at all. As a result, it was decided to monetize the most popular features of the app, compensating for the inconvenience to users by opening the source code. We also started to release versions for languages other than Russian. The original Russian version of the app even got into the top 10 of the "news and magazines" category of Google Play. While working on this project, I sort of taught myself programming, I tried new things, I made mistakes and I learned a lot. The important thing for this article is the development process. It was necessary to parse HTML on the server and then send it through API to all the sites with translations, instead of doing a separate app for each language with parsing on the client. I know this now, but 5 years ago I had very little idea of how to write servers. At the time, it didn't make much sense to me. My thinking was that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Now I write API and plan to go onto iOS and hopefully one day return to Google Play.
Then the warning lights started flashing, one after another. First Google Play began to reject new apps for copyright infringement. It was the same code, but for a site in a different language. I believe the new versions started to get rejected in the summer of 2017. However, each time it was possible to solve the issue by contacting their technical support service, which even suggested a special form, in which you can notify Google of the release of a new app by sending them any files needed. In my case, all I had to do was provide a link to the website and state that there was a license at the bottom that allowed the use of the content. After that, Google sent a letter saying that everything was okay. We were free to spread it and they had saved our information. But apps also got deleted (I’ll talk later about the difference between removal and blocking).They’d be deleted for things like mentioning the names of other apps in the description, in particular, the name of one of the games based on the site. In theory, the license should allow it. But okay, I'm not a lawyer, maybe Google was right, and we just had to clean up what they didn’t like and move on. But then they started removing apps due to the lack of privacy policy and processing of personal data. We were not alone in this situation. The problem was extensive. It seemed to have started around 2018.The network had several generators with such agreements, which were just enough to put on the website and add a link to the description of the app. Then there was Appodeal, where the app was removed due to problems in their SDK. But my mistake was that I had used the beta version, and Appodeal honestly warned about this problem the day before removal. I just had to update the SDK to the latest stable version, but I didn’t manage to up it in time.
Then things started going wrong with Google Play’s app checks. I tried to release an update with a new version of Appodeal SDK. It was rejected for the same reason. On reflection, I decided that it was easier to just remove SDK, replacing its functionality (it was used for advertising with rewards) with similar functions from AdMob. Do you think it helped? I don’t think so! This update was also rejected. But I'm a programmer. I'm cunning. I bypassed this bug on Google Play simply and gracefully. I posted an update in the form of an alpha version and raised it to the working version. And everything was fine. For a while.
Then there was the time that our apps were removed because of violations of their advertising rules. As always, no examples, just a link to the voluminous rules for developers. After talking with their technical support service, I managed to find out that Google saw a problem with the links to my other apps in Google Play, which was just a list of similar apps in other languages. I mean, come on, I can’t give links to my own apps on the same platform? Okay Google, if you want it that bad. Here you go. I released an update with "Ad " over each button-link. Problem solved.
Then I got a letter stating, "After a recent review, SCP Foundation France On/Offline database fr (ru.dante.scpfoundation.fr) has been removed from Google Play." The French version of the app got banned. The reason given was, of all things, "Violation of Sexually Explicit Content policy." And again, nothing was said about what exactly Google had found objectionable. Perhaps, if you search really thoroughly amongst the thousands of texts, you might have found a couple of provocative images. Well, I didn’t lose heart. Google probably knows what it's doing and I'm the one to blame. I put up with the loss of the app. It had a few users, but its loss didn’t set us back too much. I began to update the rest of the apps, disabling of all images. At the same time, I began to look for information on app bans on the Internet. And then I started to suspect that this was not an accident. I wasn’t the only one in this situation. It turned out that the network has many examples of app bans and even accounts bans.
Let’s digress and talk about the moderation system in Google Play. There are two or three types of sanctions against apps, depending on what you count. First, your app can be "Removed." In this case, the app will not be available for search and download on Google Play, but you have access to it in the developer console and can release an update with fixes. This is not considered a serious violation and does not affect the status of the account. A subset of this is “Update Rejection.” In this case, the app is available for search and installation through Google Play, however, you should make changes to the planned update, as it violates something — something in the current form. Like in the first case, it does not affect the status of the account and nothing threatens you except for spoiling the mood and having some extra work to do. The last type of sanction is really bad. It’s called "Suspended" and if you see a letter from Google with this word, prepare for the worst. The app isn’t just removed from Google Play, it’s removed permanently, with a ban on updating and even viewing the description, statistics and reviews in the developer console. The scary thing here isn’t that Google makes you release a new version with a new package and re-recruit users, reviews, paying audience and explain to the users of the deleted version why everything stopped working. The scary thing is that you’ve got a label on you and the timer has started. Now you are an unreliable developer. Some people say that strikes get "rotten" after about six months. If get two more "Suspended " apps, you automatically cease to be an independent Android developer forever. Google explicitly prohibits the creation of a new developer account after the ban of the existing one and, given the market share of Google Play, the ban deprives the developer of a lot market access.
Okay, back to the main plot. About three weeks later after the aforementioned app bans, I was at another meetup listening to some reports. And then I get two messages from Google. That's right, two more apps were banned. But this time, the two main ones, the Russian and the English versions. My first thought was, "Damn, I didn’t have time to release the update with the pictures disabled." But that wasn’t the reason. Here is a quote from the letter: "After review, SCP Foundation EN Database On / Offline, ru.dante.scpfoundation.eng, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a strike policy because it violates the impersonation policy." In other words, Google decided that I was impersonating another person and using someone else's brand without permission. And here's the weird thing, all apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name were removed from the store. Except the ones I posted later, notifying Google of a free content license through the form I mentioned above. And not only were my apps removed, but other developers' apps were as well, about ten or more. I didn’t count them at the time, so I don’t know how many were removed and how many developers discovered that years of their work were thrown into a landfill by Google and their robots. Now you can’t find any apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name in Google Play, which implies that none of them managed to resolve the situation with Google.
In this case, I immediately issued appeals for both apps. I wrote that the apps use content under a free license and gave them links to the site where this is clearly written. However, in response, they wrote the following:
That means that they want me to provide them with documents confirming my right to use the content and the brand, as I understand it, both the name and the icon. They also needed the documents in the form of a response to this letter from the mail server of the site. In addition, for the Russian and English versions, they had two different domains in mind, one of which is a mirror of the second, although the Russian version did not take anything at all from these sites. They didn’t care about the presence of a free license for content that allows its use, as they never even mentioning it. Although in other apps it was enough, going by the fact that other similar apps have not been removed. Okay Google, I tried to comply with this requirement of yours. I went on scp-wiki.net’s private messaging system(like other sites with translations, it works on the Wikidot engine) and I wrote to other local administrators dealing with issues related to their content licenses. In the “Help” section of the site, it was written that they answer within a day. The first admin didn't answer me, I wrote the other one, then another, then another. I was answered by deathly silence. But I didn’t give up. Although the first panic attacks began to occur, I still hoped for a solution to the problem within a week or two. Thinking about how many subscriptions to users would be canceled in this time, I browsed the net looking for information on how to make a document that the site administrators can send to Google. It looked like this. Meanwhile, I wrote a newsletter to our users through FCM, describing the situation. With that, I built a simple page on the site.
One more digression. Let me tell you about the recent scandal in the SCP Foundation community related to content licensing, copyrights, threats, revelations and other things. I don’t know if this stems from blocking apps. I’ll just give you a list of facts and you can draw your own conclusions. It went more or less like this:
I know this individual. We’d worked together for some time, mutually advertising his artbooks and our app. But at one point we had a misunderstanding about the details of our agreement which resulted in a rather unpleasant conversation. Fortunately, we managed to resolve it. However during the conversation there were direct threats to remove the apps from the Google store due to the use of the TM.
This case was in December 2018. And blocking all apps with "SCP Foundation" in their name occurred at the end of March. After two weeks, my developer account was blocked. Apparently, this was due to the fact that I had not received a response from the administrators of the English site and already had had three strikes on the account. The next day, the owner of the TM presented his own analogue version of our app. Everything seemed to check out and the reason for the block was clear. However, in a personal conversation with the owner of the TM, he denied my assumptions about his involvement and announced his intention to withdraw the TM. Google also refused to confirm my suspicions, ignoring my questions to technical support about any claims of copyright holders and the name and logo of the apps, insisting on the connection with the original site. You can decide if there is any connection.
Update: After I started writing this article, the situation with the TM has worsened. He began to block communities in VK with its help and withdrew board games from the market. The administrators of the Russian site released a post explaining the situation and reporting that the court documents for the app were almost ready. They were also supported by the original website, which started collecting donations for legal expenses. As a result, the site administrators wrote a statement to the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. It’s also worth mentioning the position of the technical support service of VK: they completely ignored any indication of the license and ban on the communities.
But let’s get back to Google. At some point I realized that there was only one way to win back the account and apps and that was to contact the admins of the original site and ask them to send an email with the ready-made document. Nothing could be easier, right? Initially, I had my doubts. Going by what I had known about the site and its administration system, they might not have their own mail server or even a desire to help me. But those were only my fears. And the task was so simple. I just had to contact them. But that turned out to be the biggest problem. No one answered my personal messages. And when one of the admins did finally answer, he said that he was busy and would answer later. Four (!) months later, I managed to get through to the administration, which said that I was not alone in this predicament. They have tried to help others with this and failed. Google just doesn't want to hear them. And they do not have their own mail server, so there is no technical possibility to send the letter I need. So the circle has been closed.
Is this an isolated case? As I’ve mentioned above, no, it’s not. You can see for yourself by searching the web or visiting my website (https://dont-play-with-google.com/). I created it specifically to collect articles about cases of blocking apps and accounts in Google Play. Some of the articles on the site were translated into Russian, English and French with the help of my friends. Keep in mind that we are not professional translators and many articles are translated automatically and only slightly corrected. It is also possible to add new articles and translations into other languages. If you have links to other blocking cases, please, add them to the site as people should know. If you want to help the site, you can translate articles, correct typos or just code. The site consists of server and client sections. BackEnd is made on Spring (Gradle, Kotlin, Postgresql): https://github.com/mohaxspb/dont-play-with-gp-api. FrontEnd — Angular (TypeScript): https://github.com/mohaxspb/dont-play-with-gp-front. Don’t judge the code too harshly as I specialize on Android. It's funny that in the process of creating the site I even had to edit the Angular compiler (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32760). PullRequests are welcomed on any subject either bugs or new opportunities. The list of tasks for the site’s functionality can be found in Trello.
Here are just a few examples of absurd app and account bans:
In all these cases, the bans occur suddenly. The developer doesn’t receive any warnings. In many cases, one can avoid getting their ban apps or accounts banned simply by changing one line in the name of the app (as in my case) or the name of the account (as in a case from the list above). However, instead of a warning with a proposal to correct the violation, you’re just banned. And technical support either doesn’t want to help you or demands unnecessary documents. I even had a case in which an automatic email from Google about a problem with the app contained broken links. Also, there are never any specifics in automatic letters, only the indication of the violated point of very vague rules and a reference to these rules. To at least get some hint to the cause of the ban, you need to contact the technical support service. And it doesn’t always give any details, like in the case of the ban of the associated account, thereby depriving you of any opportunity to do something. Here’s another example. A person got three bans on their app, all automatic. The first two bans were later canceled by technical support due to lack of violations, but the third ban appears not to be canceled.
The worst part is that there is absolutely no way to talk to a real person, only through forms with a promise of a response by mail within 72 hours. And the mail is rumored to be answered by outsourcers from India. I've no problem with that, but as for the quality of the technical support service, I think I’ve already said enough. Compare this with Google Ads technical support. They’re on the phone, in your native language, and they’ll tell you that you need to put a comma in the text and lower the age rating. And they’ll call back from a personal mobile number to check up on you. "Is your ad okay now?" I had the opportunity to compare the Google Play service and Google Ads. It's like night and day. But how did it happen? And does Google know about this issue?
Of course they do. They even have special webinars for developers to clarify the details of the moderation system, complete with tips on how to avoid getting banned. And they conduct them in the developer’s native language. And they announce these webinars on major IT resources like habr.com, the largest Russian-language IT resource. However, if you look at the recording of the webinar, you’ll find that it was just someone reading a printout of the info available in Google Help. The Q&A was also just people reading from papers, with pre-prepared answers for prepared questions. It was all just to check a box. Google does not have any real desire to help developers. The video of the webinar has already been removed. It was here. There was also a chat in which dozens of developers, including me, tried to ask questions about blocks on our accounts and apps. We were answered with links to their rules. We were so upset, we tried to organize a Telegram chat. If you are interested in talking to colleagues about similar unfortunate events, welcome to our chat: https://t.me/android_developers_ban.
On the other hand, in local markets, Google is trying to convince everyone how amazingly organized they are at helping developers launch, distributing and support apps. For example, you read about how well everything is organized. Google Play is constantly in touch, always willing to help with advice on any matter. Help with promotion, help in general, whatever you need. It’s not just any old technical support, it’s a waking dream. But when people went to the comments section and asked how to get this access in Google Play, they were all ignored. Obviously, it was just a promotional article designed to draw developers into the store.
How did it happen that the app store, which once allowed anyone put up any app of any quality without being afraid of it getting banned, has now turned into a place where you’re terrified to post an update or even have the app on your account. Some say that bots check and can ban even unpublished apps. And you can’t delete them if someone has the app installed. There are several reasons for that, as far as I understand:
My friends told me about companies involved in the creation of apps that just embed WebView, in order to redirect advertising traffic to users. Their only goal is to push their app in the store, one way or another, and earn at least some money. If the account is blocked, they simply switch to another one. They have a lot of tools to hide their digital tracks. They can avoid bans for linked accounts and there’s even a market for selling developer accounts formed around them. It’s clear that such abuses can be fought only with the help of robots. But the wrongdoers don’t get punished, they just buy a new account for a few dollars. While ordinary developers suffer from friendly fire and lose their apps forever. Their apps are often their only source of income. But maybe these are unavoidable losses. It’s just the unavoidable result of the reliable security we enjoy on Google Play. Unfortunately, no. There’s constantly news about dozens of new malwares, viruses and other things popping up. Google can't keep users or developers safe.
What conclusion can be drawn from all this? I’m sorry to say it, especially after so many years, but my conclusion seems to be that you can no longer consider Google Play to be a reliable platform for publishing apps. Or even as a platform where you can count on a reliable source of income. And the worst part is that there are simply no alternatives, unless you publish in China where Google is banned. And after your account is deleted, you might not be able to continue earning ad revenue while you're trying to recover it; unless, of course, as per Google’s advice, you use their advertising SDK from AdMob. As soon as your app and/or account is banned, advertising in AdMob immediately becomes disabled. And it doesn't work the other way around. If you manage to restore the app/account you will have to write to AdMob technical support to restore the advertising display. You can use other advertising SDKs, but with new risks. I’ve already described a case of the failure in Google Play due to the availability of the SDK from Appodeal. The latter, by the way, also requires an account in AdMob and an app in Google Play and will seriously limit the display of ads or disable them altogether in case of problems with Google.
As you can see, if you are going to build a serious business with distribution through Google Play, you need to be prepared for the fact that you might suddenly lose it all and your only hope is a possible hype in the media. Or you need to be a company the size of Facebook, then you will have the phone number of a manager at Google and you’ll be able to solve any problem quickly and easily. And you won’t be banned for the nude photos of your app users which they placed there themselves. But if you are not Facebook, you’ll just be banned, because you violated the rules. And in this case, the developers managed to restore the app. After 3 months! But we all know that such a situation simply doesn’t happen to large companies. As indicated in the first link, the ban was for a picture which was considered too racy for Google Play. However, the developers found the exact same picture in Twitch and other big apps. That means the rules are not only vague, but also do not apply to everyone. Some developers are “more equal” than others.
So, can we improve the situation? I don’t think we can. Google is a commercial company and their goal is to make money. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. But it means that the company will try to reduce costs and increase profits. And try to avoid lawsuits. As a result, it is easier and cheaper for them to ban apps and developers automatically than to hire a huge number of specialists who will personally understand the nuances and view each app, especially since, most likely, a very small percentage of developers and apps give the bulk of the revenue to Google Play. I have not seen detailed statistics on this topic, but I think it is unlikely that the situation here is very different from the situation with another Google service: YouTube. According to this study from Pex only 0.64% of videos get more than 100,000 views. And those videos generate 81.6% of all platform views. And since videos with a small number of views do not meet the criteria for enabling monetization, YouTube can remove 99% of all videos with almost no loss in profits and significantly reducing the cost of infrastructure for their storage. Moreover, at the time of writing YouTube plans to include a clause in their rules on December 10th, 2019, in which a user can be banned if he does not make a profit. "YouTube may terminate your access to or access through your Google account to all or part of the Service if it considers that providing you with access to the Service no longer makes commercial sense." I’m sure the same situation exists in Google Play. This way they can ban 99% of developers and apps and even increase profits.And don’t even dream that the situation with technical support is better on YouTube. It’s the same story. Automatic bans, unsubscribed by bots, inability to talk to a real tech support person. Unless of course you’re one of the few who rake in significant profits for the service.
Is there any way to fix the situation? I'm not sure that's possible. Because it’s more profitable for Google to leave the situation as it is than to spend huge amounts on a solution. It seems that we developers affected by Google bots can only write articles about it over and over again, hoping that someone at Google will read and manually restore our app or account. I think you shouldn’t discount the thought that developers could unite and act as a united front to change the situation. People are wired this way. They think about such solutions when so many people face the same problem. Since I began to develop for Android, I had read articles about bans, but of course, I never thought that this would happen to me. I'm not a spammer. I don’t write viruses and in general, I am always ready to wait on Google hand and foot. And I didn’t think I would lose everything because I didn’t change one word in the name of an app, especially since the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License permits it, as far as I understand. At least I successfully uploaded two of my ten apps to the Amazon store and they didn't have any questions about them.
Here’s a list of what I think any developer should do to minimize the damage from apps and accounts getting blocked. Not to avoid the damage, but to reduce it, because no one will warn you that the Google algorithm has found a problem.
Also, I would add to this list my thoughts on how the situation could be improved by creating competition. A while back Google was obliged to provide a choice of search engine at the first Android launch. It would be logical to oblige Google to also offer a choice of app store. Competition could emerge this way and, perhaps, Google would start to provide technical support on the phone (like in Russia, where Google has a strong competitor, Yandex) and stop automatic bans and let bots only be used for giving advice to moderators. Many problems could also be solved by changing the practice of banning without warning, so that the developer has the opportunity to fix something. Sometimes it is enough to change one word in the title to stay in good standing with the Google Play moderation system.
I don’t really believe I can do anything alone to improve the situation, but I won’t forgive myself if I didn’t try something, such as writing this article. Not expecting much, I sent an appeal to the FAS, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. Please note, I am not a lawyer or a writer. I'm a programmer. So my application must be rather informal and generally naive, because it seems only the state can protect developers from Google.
If you are also not satisfied with the current situation, please do the same. I am sure that things will improve if the app market on Android gets healthy competition between stores.
And finally, I would like to try to reach out to Google (in case someone from the company reads this article) and ask them to do something. For example:
I would be very happy if Google restored my apps and account, because I’ve invested a lot of work in them for more than five years. I hope at least someone will hear me. I hope that one day Google will be able to configure the moderation system so that developers will be safe from the situation when one day they find that themselves thrown out of the market by some program by a ridiculous mistake.

On Windows 10, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature that creates a lightweight environment that allows you to install and run supported versions of Linux (such as Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Debian, etc.) without the complexity of setting up a virtual machine or different computer.
Although you won't get a graphical interface, this approach enables developers and network administrators to use a long list of command tools and services (such as vim, tmux, andemacs, sshd, Apache, and MySQL), and run Bash shell scripts written in Python, Ruby, C#, F#, and many others using a command console.

*Updated December 9, 2019:** Sega confirmed that the bundle should launch on February 18, 2020.
Last night, we reported that a remastered version of Vanquish was spotted on the Microsoft Store. The release date was listed as February 2020 and it said that the game ran at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second (FPS) on Xbox One X. Well, this was just part of the story.
In 2017, images of a Bayonetta and Vanquish remaster bundle leaked online but Sega didn't confirm that it was working on native Xbox One ports of the two titles. Flash forward to the end of 2019 and TrueAchievements not only managed to spot Vanquish, but they also reported that Bayonetta was listed on the store. That too runs at 4K 60 FPS on Xbox One X and comes in at over 12 GB.

The Bayonetta and Vanquish bundle is indeed real and should launch on February 18, 2020. It's unclear how much it's going to cost, but I'm going to get $50 to $60, with each game being around $25 to $30. However, only time will tell. Sega may decide to reduce the price further, but given the sheer demand for both experiences, that's probably unlikely.
She's back!
Experience the genesis of the Bayonetta series with the cult classic, original action-adventure game. The tantalizing Umbra Witch rises from the depths after half a millennium in slumber with no recollection of her mysterious past.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Source: Microsoft
Microsoft has announced plans to migrate Minecraft PlayStation 4 players to its unified Bedrock client, falling in parallel to the universal versions for Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and more. That update brings content in-line with other mainline versions of the blocky bestseller, enabling full cross-platform multiplayer with other systems, alongside purchases and progression. The update is scheduled to roll out tomorrow, December 10, 2019, free to all existing owners.
Minecraft first introduced cross-play in late 2017 with its "Better Together" update, merging players on Xbox One, PC, and more under a single codebase, followed by Nintendo Switch. However, with Sony long-averse to cross-play for PlayStation 4, the generation's top-selling console saw itself excluded from the movement. Sony changed stance in late 2018 caving to demands, since welcoming Fortnite and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare among the many tearing down the wall.

As first reported earlier this month, Minecraft PlayStation 4 will receive an imminent update, leveraging Microsoft's Xbox Live backend. The update also brings cross-platform progression and saves, including access to Microsoft's Minecraft Marketplace for worlds, skins, and mini-games. The process requires a Microsoft Account, with multiplayer included for all Minecraft owners on PlayStation 4, with a PlayStation Plus subscription.
The addition of PlayStation 4 to Minecraft's Bedrock family finally unifies Microsoft's cross-platform vision, compatible with Xbox One, Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android mobile devices, and Gear VR.
Minecraft gets full-blown crossplay
Minecraft is getting PlayStation 4 cross-play support soon, bringing full compatibility between virtually every platform in existence.

Capcom has teased the existence of the Resident Evil 3 remake for some time. Recently, the cover art for the game leaked, so we know that an announcement is coming soon. Here's everything we know about this impending survival-horror game.
This is a full remake and reimagining of Capcom's Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, which released back in 1999. This game follows Jill Valentine, one of the protagonists of the original Resident Evil, as she attempts to escape Raccoon City, which is completely overrun with zombies. Along the way, an advanced creature known as the Nemesis begins stalking her throughout the city.

Much like Resident Evil 2 (2019), Capcom is treating this remake as an entirely new entry, it's not a remaster. While it will be faithful to the story and characters, things may happen in different ways and enemy encounters or puzzles may play out differently.
Again like Resident Evil 2 (2019), the remake of Resident Evil 3 is a third-person survival-horror game. Players will have to manage scarce ammo and healing items as they struggle to survive.
Here's everything we know about the different features of the game, as well as some pre-release images. We have the different cover art for the game:

While we don't yet know if there will be a demo, Capcom has historically provided demos for their major upcoming games. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard had multiple demos, as did Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry V and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.
We don't have a release date at the moment, though it's almost certainly going to be sometime in 2020. Capcom tends to favor January, March and September release date periods.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Source: Windows Central
Microsoft's Xbox One has accumulated an impressive assortment of music services, with Spotify, Soundcloud, and Pandora all among the services with apps for the console. Despite this, Apple Music, one of the biggest players in the music streaming space, is yet to deliver a solution for gaming consoles. While official support isn't expected soon, a third-party application known as AirServer delivers relatively seamless workaround to enjoy the service with gaming. Hooking directly into AirPlay, Apple's propriety wireless streaming protocol used across its devices, Apple Music content can be remotely cast directly to Xbox One from your iPhone or iPad.

Setting up AirServer on Xbox One is a relatively simple process, with no accounts or passwords to handle. Simply install the app and you'll be ready to go. Although the full version of the app is relatively expensive at $20 via the Microsoft Store, its handy free trial offers a chance to decide if the app is for you.
After completing the above steps, switch to your iOS device to complete the setup process.
Source: Windows Central
AirPlay is directly integrated into the iOS operating system, making audio and video streaming a simple process from iPhones, iPads, and other compatible devices running iOS 4.3 or higher. Taking advantage of this, AirServer essentially emulates the receiving capabilities of an Apple TV. Although AirServer recommends using its "AirServer Connect" application to eliminate initial discoverability issues, following an initial setup, connecting and disconnecting is a relatively seamless.
Following a successful pairing, your Xbox One can now recieve video and audio from your iOS device.

After establishing a connection between your Xbox One and iOS device via AirServer, you'll now be ready to play Apple Music tracks through your console. With support for background audio, the Xbox One's feature that allows music to play while gaming, you won't need to leave AirServer running to enjoy your music.
Once connected, audio playback, including volume controls and track selection, can be handled by your iOS device. Alternatively, playing, pausing, skipping and volume levels are all accessible using the Xbox One's background audio controls on the Guide menu.
While these steps specifically target Apple Music, AirServer supports remote broadcasting from a majority of music and video apps. Screen-mirroring over AirPlay even allows games and other content to be directly captured from your phone and outputted via your Xbox One. While the app might not be cheap, this is a great solution for those heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.
Get around Apple's ecosystem lockout with this third-party app
AirPlay doesn't officially support the Xbox One so enter the third-party developer community and this way to get around that.

Recently Apple launched a web app for the Apple Music service and, for the most part, it's very good. It's certainly a more elegant way to listen to your playlists at the computer than iTunes for Windows.
Since the Xbox One has a built-in web browser you might be hoping that it'd be an easy, free way to listen to your music through your console. Alas, that's not the case, at least not right now. Technically Apple Music for the web is in beta, but whether the problem is Apple, Microsoft, or a combination of both, it just doesn't work.
You can log in and see music, albeit after an excruciatingly long wait for everything to load properly. Actually playing music seems a step too far. It might work in the future, who knows, but right now, it's one to steer clear of.
Apple's music streaming service is really good
It's not particularly Xbox friendly, but Apple Music is really good, with an enormous library and excellent curated selections.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple gets FCC approval for Mac Pro tower, and rack-mount version</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Communication Commission has given the all-clear for the Mac Pro, with both the tower and rack-mounted version of the Mac workstation clearing regulatory checks for radio frequency emissions.
Initially revealed at WWDC 2019 alongside the new Mac Pro for conventional usage at a desk, little has been heard about the version that is intended to be mounted in a rack and used as a server. However, FCC regulatory filings about the device have surfaced, confirming it is on the way and could arrive soon. The filing for model number A2304 offer no real major details about the model other than what is already known or expected, such as its appearance. A photograph showing the test setup for the rack-mount Mac Pro shows it to look very close to the version briefly displayed in an image on the WWDC stage, complete with the signature metal lattice and two handles in the front. Other than the alternate enclosure, it is highly probable the internals will be the same as for the regular Mac Pro, complete with all of the possible upgrade options. One detail from the filing is that the unit measures 8.58 inches thick. In terms of a typical 19-inch-wide server cabinet, this means the rackable Mac Pro takes up 4.9U of space at 1.75 inches per "U", equating to a 5U enclosure. Apple is anticipated to start taking orders for the Mac Pro on Tuesday, but it remains to be seen whether the rack-mountable variant will be offered at the same time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rosenblatt spews specs for six 'iPhone 12' models while reiterating Sell rating on AAPL shares</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rosenblatt Securities said Monday it believes Apple is working on as many as six different "iPhone 12" models —including 'Plus' and 'Max' size variants of its 'Pro' series — but nonetheless reiterated its sell rating on the company's shares, predicting impending share losses in China that won't be helped by a so-called 'iPhone SE 2.'
In a lengthy note to investors seen by AppleInsider, Rosenblatt outlined expectations for the iPhone models it expects to see in 2020. Much like other predictions, Rosenblatt believes there will be an "iPhone SE 2" release early in the year, followed by a batch of iPhone 12 models in the fall. The "iPhone SE 2," anticipated for a March release, will consist of a 4G smartphone with a 5.1-inch LCD and a single rear camera, the firm says. While Rosenblatt reckons it will be equipped with the current A13 processor, Apple may also side with inclusion of Touch ID over Face ID, a move which is most likely thought enable the iPhone maker to "clean [out] some old component inventory." Despite the potential popularity for the device, Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang doubts the device will be "as attractive as the iPhone 11" to customers due to the iPhone 11's low price, additional promotions for the iPhone in China, and an expectation that China's 4G market "will drop dramatically" early in the year. For the "iPhone 12" range, Zhang expects there to be a far wider array of models to choose from than Apple has ever offered before, in part due to the introduction of 5G. The analyst's model predictions include:
To further complicate matters, Zhang also suggests the "iPhone 12" Pro 5G could be offered in variants supporting sub-6GHz only or adding mmWave compatibility. With all that on the table, the analyst makes a point of hedging his bets, advising his clients that while Apple is working on "multiple projects simultaneously" for the next iPhone, he has no "clear idea as to which model and version will launch." While the bulk of the handsets outlined in Monday's research note point to a September launch, Zhang suggests the "iPhone 12" Pro 5G could launch in the spring of 2021, to "target the middle-end 5G market." The shift towards 5G iPhones is also prompting some changes in fundamental device design, according to Rosenblatt, with Apple electing for a number of different components entirely in those models over 4G. For the frame, the 4G models and the sub-6GHz variants could use an alloy frame, Zhang said. Meanwhile, those with mmWave support will potentially employ a steel frame with holes, "in order to improve mmWave signals" which are more sensitive to interference from the local environment and distances. When it comes to radio density (or RF content) within the new iPhones, the analyst believes the 5G models will require approximately 30% more componentry than those of existing 4G iPhones. For the sub-6GHz models, Broadcom and Murata are expected to see more orders from Apple, while mmWave versions are believed to utilized Qualcomm components as well as some filters from Avago. LCP antenna producers will also see gains in orders over the course of the year for the model.Wireless charging capabilities are also due for upgrades alongside the next generation of iPhone 5G and 4G devices, Zhang told clients. This is likely "due to 5G consuming battery life faster than 4G." Memory specifications are likely to remain the same as the current generation for the basic models, while iPhone 5G models selling for more than $1,200 could see upgraded DRAM levels, he said.When it comes to iPhone 5G sales expectations, Rosenblatt is admittedly bearish, estimating builds of 30 million device and sell-throughs of less than 20 million during calendar year 2020. The firm believes Android 5G devices will begin taking market share from Apple in China in early 2020, where 5G deployment will enjoy a several months-long head start on most markets, including all of North America. For Apple, the costs associated with the launch of 5G devices will also be an obstacle, according to the firm, with the average selling price of iPhone 5G devices expected to fetch $200 more than their 4G equivalents. The lack of a "mid-priced 5G smartphone launching in 2020" means Rosenblatt doesn't expect "a big 5G cycle for Apple in C2020." As usual, Rosenblatt pessimistically rates Apple as "Sell" with a market low price target of $150, which it believes is "warranted for a company that could face potential problems in the smartphone market." Apple shares were trading down roughly 0.4% to $269.62 in Monday morning trading on the NASDAQ stock market.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'iPhone 12' could get bigger battery because of smaller circuitry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A reduction in the size of an essential battery protection circuit for the iPhone could mean that Apple has room to include bigger batteries in the 2020 "iPhone 12" series.
Sources within the supply chain claim that the "iPhone 12" expected to be released in late 2020 will feature smaller battery-related circuitry. The custom battery Protection Module Package (PMP) which governs charging is said to be both 50% smaller and thinner. The difference could mean that Apple will be able to increase the size of the battery.According to The Elec, a Korean website, the reduction and redesign has been done by South Korea's ITM Semiconductor. The company reportedly first supplied the protection module to Apple for the iPhone 11, although it already provides components for the AirPods Pro.ITM Semiconductor is said to currently be one of three suppliers making what are called Protection Circuit Modules or PCMs. Compeq in Taiwan and MinebeaMitsumi in Japan have also made them for Apple. However, what ITM Semiconductor has redesigned is a Protection Module Package (PMP) which appears to be unique to the company.It's this new PMP which is smaller and so may provide extra room for battery space. Separate reports, though, say that 5G in the forthcoming iPhones will require larger circuit boards which may mean there's still no more space for larger batteries.
ITM Semiconductor is reportedly due to complete work on a third plant in Vietnam which is intended to be used solely for Apple. The company is said to be planning a fourth plant and it's also possible that the PMP will be used in tablets and computers as well as phones.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Penticton RCMP is warning the public about a new phone scam taking place within the South Okanagan. 
The cell phone “port-out” scam sees scammers gather as much information as possible about a target. The crook then uses the information to contact your mobile provider and requested your number be ported over to a new phone. 
“Once they have the number ported over to a new device, they are able to gain access to internet accounts which require a text to phone code for verification,” said Const. James Grandy. 
“This text is often referred to as ‘two-factor authentication,’ and is increasingly being used by online banking to keep accounts secure.”
Tips to protect yourself:
If you become a victim of this kind of scam, please report it to your local RCMP Detachment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2021 Audi Q7 will be a thoroughly refreshed example of the three-row luxury crossover, as we saw in its European reveal. One of the noteworthy additions was the inclusion of a plug-in hybrid variant that we expected to come to the States. Now the specs are in, and we checked in with Audi to see if there was any news for an American-specification one. Turns out there is news: there won't be a U.S. one.
The Audi representative we reached out to explained that Audi found too much overlap between the Q5 plug-in hybrid, announced before the Q7, and the latest E-tron EVs. As such, the Q7 plug-in hybrid will not be imported, despite the fact that the more powerful Q7 will share its powertrain with the North America-bound A8 sedan, both of which make 449 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. The lower power Q7 has a powertrain making 375 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque. Both systems have a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 and an electric motor.
As for the purely internal-combustion-powered refreshed Q7, it's still on its way to the United States. The Audi representative couldn't give us exact timing, but said it would launch here sometime in 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class and electric EQA spied with minimal camouflage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The reveal of the 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is just days away, but we're getting a sneak peek thanks to one of our spy photographers. An example of the subcompact luxury crossover was spied with only camouflage vinyl on the front and rear, with the rest of the car exposed. We also got a look at the electric EQA, which, compared with the GLA, appears to be mostly the same vehicle but with an electric powertrain.
Starting with the GLA-Class, we can see some resemblance to the A-Class hatchback sold overseas. It has a long, low, raked nose and windshield, but it has plenty of its own styling cues, too. The whole vehicle looks taller than A-Class hatch, both in ride height and in profile. The greenhouse is different, with the side windows extending past the edge of the rear doors, and the window sill kicks up toward the back. The hatch is more vertical, there's more body cladding and the wheel arches are squared-off.
When the GLA-Class is revealed this week, it should have the same powertrains as the boxy GLB-Class. That means a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four making 221 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque going through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic and either front- or all-wheel drive. Later, it will be treated to the same high-output turbo 2.0-liter in the CLA 45, available in 382-horsepower and 416-horsepower trims.
Then of course there's the EQA, the little sibling to the EQC electric crossover. These latest spy shots suggest that it will be extremely similar to the GLA-Class. It has the same profile as the GLA, and with a GLB-Class in the background, we can see it's about the same size as the GLA. The wheel arches are similarly shaped, as are the nose and tail. This is a contrast to the EQA concept from the Frankfurt Motor Show a few years ago that was a small little hatchback rather than a crossover. But the crossover body style is likely to be more appealing in America, and a tall crossover makes it easy to hide batteries under the floor without changing the shape much. It will probably have a unique grille and fascia trim to make it look more like the larger EQC.
Details are scarce regarding the EQA's powertrain. Considering the EQC's range of around 200 miles, we wouldn't expect any more than that from this smaller vehicle. Front-wheel drive seems likely considering the platform is shared with the GLA-Class, A-Class and others. It will probably be revealed sometime in 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TikTok slammed for removing same-sex couple's pictures from India and Pakistan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Instagram photoshoot of a Hindu-Muslim same-sex couple, hailing from India and Pakistan, had gone viral on social media and users are going gaga over the pictures.
The pictures showed Anjali Chakra from India and Sundas Malik from Pakistan laughing and kissing under a rain-splattered umbrella in traditional outfits.
The same-sex couple then shared a video of the two dancing on video-sharing app TikTok.
Now the couple is creating headlines as TikTok has pulled down the video as per its community guidelines.
As per a report, the video-sharing site restricts posts by users it identifies as disabled, fat or LGBTQ+.
Chakra posted the same video on micro-blogging site Twitter on December 2 after learning that TikTok had pulled her video down.
She retweeted the video and wrote, “TikTok deleted this for ‘violating community guidelines’ so the rumours about homophobia are true.”
“@tiktok_us you wanna explain why this got taken down,” she added.
In the video, the couple can be seen dancing, first wearing casual outfits and then sporting traditional clothes.
The shared post triggered an outpouring of support for the couple on social media. Many users supported the couple and asked them to keep posting.
Aryaa Bhattacharya, Twitter user said,”I read the tiktok community guidlines and in no way the video violates it!! It is just so disappointing!!”
While Asha, another user said that,”I actually feel sick to my stomach… They’re fine with promoting violent relationships but not loving ones?! I just don’t understand…”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguar upgrades I-Pace with increased range for free</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jaguar launched the I-Pace eTrophy racing series in 2018, and ever since, it's been collecting data on its battery electric crossover. Using that research, Jaguar has managed small refinements that incrementally improve how the car runs and drives. In past times, these types of upgrades were implemented during a refresh or redesign, but thanks to the computerized nature of modern vehicles, tuning information can be relayed to the vehicles immediately. Installed by dealers, Jaguar is releasing a free I-Pace software update that affects the battery, aerodynamics and all-wheel-drive system.  
Jaguar already offers one of the best battery-operated vehicles on the road today, but the competition pool is quickly improving and becoming more crowded. In order to keep the I-Pace fresh, Jaguar decided to share its learnings from its eTrophy racing series and "more than 50 million miles" of real-world driving. 
As it stands, the I-Pace packs a 90-kWh lithium-ion battery that is EPA-rated at 234 miles on a single charge. It has 394 maximum horsepower, 512 lb-ft of torque, and Jaguar claims it can do 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds. With the new update, Jaguar says the battery can "run to a lower state of charge than previously without affecting drivability, durability, or performance." This only affects range and efficiency, though, not power.
All I-Paces are all-wheel-drive, and the update directly affects the car's traction system. Jaguar has refined the torque distribution between the front and rear motors, which improves the car's efficiency in ECO mode. A third update deals with the car's aerodynamics. Jaguar has refined thermal management control by using the active radiator vane system more frequently. Finally, small tweaks also improved the regenerative braking system.  
All said, these upgrades potentially equate to an 8% increase in range, which is about 12 miles, depending on usage. Jaguar did note, however, that the official EPA number would not change. Those who own I-Paces can take their cars to a local dealership, and a technician will update the software, which also includes advanced over-the-air functionality.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Land Rover reportedly lining up a $33,000 small SUV</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fresh off the reveal of the new version of its 2020 Defender SUV, a new report suggests that Land Rover could be planning an entry-level small SUV priced around $33,000, plus a battery-electricluxury version of the Defender with a price in the six figures.
British site Autocarreports that the entry-level Land Rover is envisioned at around £25,000, which equates to $32,880 at current exchange rates, and is targeting a 2021 arrival date. If true, that would make it the lowest-priced Land Rover model, slotting below the Discovery Sport in the company’s lineup of SUVs. As for the high-end Defender, it would reportedly come with sharper and leaner styling and a super-luxe interior and be called the Defender Sport, but not be ready for a reveal for four more years.
Despite offering a detailed report, Autocar does not say anything about the sources of its information. When contacted for comment by Autoblog, a Land Rover spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on speculation about future products, adding "we’re confident that the Defender family we have launched will meet the needs of every customer out there no matter how varied their requirements."
Styling on the entry-level Land Rover would reportedly hew to the new Defender and reference the brand’s original model. Ditto the interior. It’s not known yet how the vehicle would be branded, since the new Defender will be positioned higher in the market, with the four-door Defender 110 starting at $50,925, including destination fee, when it goes on sale in the spring and the smaller Defender 90 two-door likely a bit lower when it hits next fall.
It’s said that upcoming CO2 regulations in the European Union are driving the need for a smaller ‘ute to offset the gas-guzzling mix of large and heavy SUVs in Land Rover’s lineup. It would reportedly ride atop a modified version of a platform developed by parent company Tata that could accommodate a small battery pack, meaning plug-in hybrid variants paired with the 1.5-liter three-cylinder Ingenium engine could be part of the mix.
Though much remains unknown about Land Rover’s plans, it’s not hard to see a market stateside for a smaller Land Rover that could compete with popular small SUVs like the Jeep Cherokee, Toyota RAV4 and even the comparably priced Volvo XC40.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA shown in design sketches ahead of this week's debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mercedes-Benz published a design sketch on its social media channels to preview the second-generation GLA crossover. The model is scheduled to make its debut online on December 11.
The sketch picks up where the last batch of teaser images left off. Don't pay attention to the huge wheels; they're not headed to production. The rest looks fairly accurate. The next GLA is taller and more SUV-like than the outgoing model, it's about half an inch shorter, and it looks like it's better proportioned. While we haven't seen the front end yet, earlier spy shots suggest it wears a sharper design. It falls in line with the design language seen recently on the firm's other compacts.
The similarities continue inside. In a separate post, Mercedes released an image that shows part of the model's cockpit. The air vents, the digital instrument cluster, and the steering wheel are the same units you'll find inside the firm's other compacts. The MBUX infotainment system will be offered, too.
The GLA shares more than styling cues and interior parts with the second-generation CLA, the first A-Class sedan, the seven-seater GLB, and the minivan-esque B-Class sold in Europe. All of these models ride on a front-wheel drive architecture that can be upgraded with 4Matic all-wheel drive. Like most of its siblings, the GLA will get a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder as its entry-level engine. Mercedes will add more powerful turbo fours (including a 416-horsepower unit that will power the flagship GLA 45), and a plug-in hybrid model could join the range a few years into the production run.
The next GLA will break cover on the Mercedes Me media platform the firm launched in 2017 at 2 p.m. CET on Dec. 11, which is 8 a.m. in New York and 5 a.m. in Los Angeles. It will be the first time Mercedes introduces a car exclusively online. There won't be an unveiling event organized for the media, and executives purposely chose to step well out of the auto show circuit. It's a move that saves a significant amount of money while drawing attention to the Mercedes Me platform.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The McLaren 620R is revealed as a road-legal 570S GT4 race car</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Perhaps you missed out on the limited-run McLaren Senna race car for the road. Those were all snapped up immediately, so it’s understandable if you did. Don’t fret, though, because McLaren just unveiled another road-legal race car that it plans to sell 350 of. It’s called the McLaren 620R, and it’s even more exclusive than the 500-unit Senna.
The 620R is truly a road-legal 570S GT4 race car at its core. McLaren simply homologated it for road use, and then took advantage of the total lack of racing regulations to make it even quicker than the race version. The end result is rather enticing.
To make it road legal, McLaren attacked a laundry list of items. The massive rear wing gained a brake light. McLaren says that cars will be delivered to customers in the most roadworthy low-downforce setting, but a McLaren retailer is able to adjust it to one of the two other more aggressive settings — in maximum attack, it can contribute 408 pounds of downforce. The front bumper and splitter were redesigned with “more pronounced aero blades” on the splitter. Dive planes were added to help accelerate air flow along the sides of the car and aid brake cooling. Then, the redesigned carbon fiber hood has two nostrils to clean up the air flowing over the top of the car and aid downforce. The full frontal aero package is able to produce up to 143 pounds of downforce.
As expected, it uses an unshackled version of the 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 out of the GT4 race car. In this spec, it produces 612 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque. That’s good for a 0-60 mph sprint in 2.8 seconds and a maximum speed of 200 mph.
The dampers are straight off the GT4, too. They’re manually adjustable, and actually contribute to a 13-pound weight savings over the road version of the 570S. Still, these dampers are meant for the track, so expect them to be brutally stiff on our pockmarked roads. Lightweight aluminum wishbones and uprights are used, plus stiffer anti-roll bars as well. Carbon ceramic rotors and forged aluminum calipers are used to stop. McLaren says stopping power is spectacular with the standard Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires, but it’s taken to an entirely new level with the optional full slicks.
Buyers in the U.S. are allowed even more goodies than those elsewhere with this car. You’re able to spec an MSO upgrade package that features a carbon fiber roof and roof scoop for the car’s intake. The McLaren Track Telemetry system comes with this package, allowing you to record your lap times and analyze them later. The starting price is $299,000, and production will begin in January 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla Cybertruck looks like an alien spaceship on L.A.'s 405</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many criticized the Tesla Cybertruck for being closer to a prototype than to a production model, and time will tell how much of the design the company is able to keep. In the meantime, Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk proved it's more realistic than it might seem by taking it for a spin.
Footage of the Cybertruck, a one-off as of this writing, prowling the streets of Los Angeles has surfaced on Twitter, and on an enthusiast forum dedicated to the model. One Angeleno posted a video of it cruising down the 405, while several car spotters saw it parked in front of Nobu, a Japanese restaurant in Malibu. It was often accompanied by a Model 3, and some claim Musk was behind the wheel -- and, later, behind a delicious plate of Japanese food.
Over at TMZ, they reported that Musk was behind the wheel with a truckload of passengers, and was showing off the truck to actor Edward Norton. And the truck was apparently unwieldly enough that Musk hit a traffic pylon pulling into the Nobu parking lot.
 
Tesla repaired the side window that broke during the unveiling before letting its chief executive take the truck out for a spin. And if you're wondering how on earth it's street-legal, take a look at the back end: It's wearing a manufacturer plate. From a legal perspective, there's not a big difference between Musk driving around in a Cybertruck prototype and vehicle development engineers putting camouflaged test mules through their paces in Death Valley.
Our best look yet at the Cybertruck in real-world conditions suggests it's even more UFO-like when it's surrounded by the cars we're used to seeing in 2019. It's also huge; it dwarfs the Model 3. And, a photo taken near LAX by Twitter user Cody Simms shows the truck's hitch.
There's no word on why the Cybertruck was let loose in traffic. Musk — assuming he really was behind the wheel — might be gathering data on the powertrain, or he might have simply felt the urge to show it off in order to keep the hype going. Either way, we expect more reports of wild Cybertruck sightings in the coming months as Tesla develops and refines the model, which is tentatively scheduled to enter production in late 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Video: Check out this custom-made BMW M3 CS Touring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BMW M3 CS was unveiled by the German manufacturer as a more poised and agile track weapon than the standard M3 and Competition Package. It was created to be lighter and sharper, so combining the CS badge with the Touring body style is a bit of an oxymoron. Nevertheless, a lot of enthusiasts –especially around good old Europe — are fascinated by this body style. So here we are, discussing whether what we’re looking at here is a true BMW M3 CS Touring model.
The guys from Evolve hooked up with the owner and creator of this car to offer us some insight into what he’s done and why this is a CS Touring model. According to him, the car was done using a BMW M3 CS donor. As far as I can gather, they used the body of a 3 Series Touring as a starting point but changed out everything underneath the sheet metal with parts from the M3 CS. One of the reasons why that was done is because the donor M3 was crashed and couldn’t really be fixed on the outside.
Luckily, even though the body panels were basically destroyed, the engine and other tech bits underneath were ok and they were transferable into the Touring body. As an interesting side note, the Touring 3 Series he used as a mounting bed was originally a 316d, the cheapest, least powerful 3er you could get in that body style. That car was also not running but it did have perfectly functional chassis.
The process entailed taking everything off the 316d Touring and replacing it with BMW M3 CS parts. Almost everything up to the A-Pillar was changed. And it wasn’t just the exterior that was swapped. Inside the cabin you’ll notice everything looks just like on the real deal.
There’s M3 CS seats all around, a new dash, new instrument cluster and even the center armrest was deleted. It is truly an impressive build but would you considering a true BMW M3 CS Touring?

    <h5 class="mb-1">BMW was reportedly targeted by hackers, foiled their plans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It has been recently reported in German media that BMW along with other car manufacturers were recently targeted by a hacker group. The group, otherwise known as Ocean Lotus used a backdoor into BMW’s systems, for what seems to be a potential scan for trade secrets in a typical industrial espionage scheme.
According to a report published by German media outlet Bayerisher Rundfunk, the BMW security team found out about the breach early on, as far back as April. Their decision was to let the hackers browse through their data, without allowing them to reach truly valuable and sensitive information. This move was aimed at finding out more about the group themselves and what they were actually looking for.
Ocean Lotus is known to have ties to the Vietnamese government and it seems like this isn’t the first time they did this. Toyota reported a similar situation. The Japanese manufacturer’s global network was affected and apparently the hackers managed to steal 3.1 million customer records back then. As for the BMW breach, it seems like the main goal was to steal tech in a bid to help Vietnam’s own home-grown brand VinFast.
That would be a peculiar move though as VinFast works with BMW on a number of topics, the German car maker actually being a provider for the newly released company. However, stranger things have happened and it will be interesting to see how this affects the relationship on the long run.
This move would follow in the footsteps of what China did and is still doing, the Chinese having a long record of similar attempts at stealing tech and valuable info from various companies around the world, not necessarily strictly from the automotive industry.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This stretched, bulletproof Rolls-Royce Phantom costs $3.3 million</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So you thought the Rolls-Royce Phantom is the best Roller you can get? You thought it’s also quite expensive, didn’t you? Well, I’m about to rock your world with an even better proposition that’s based on the Phantom and yet so much more. What we have here today might be a good proposition for services created to protect very important people around the world, such as the Secret Service, for example.
This is a stretched, bulletproof Rolls-Royce Phantom. It comes from the guys over at Klassen, who are otherwise known for other interesting, unique projects they have signed off before. Based on the long wheelbase Rolls-Royce Phantom, their stretched version has over a meter extra in between the axles, raising the car’s total length to 7,032 mm (277 in or 23.1 feet). That means this thing will carry you and several other people in comfort wherever you go.
It’s not just luxury, space and comfort this thing provides. According to the ad on a popular car-selling website in Europe, the car is also B7 certified which means it can withstand gun fire and small explosions thus making it a good choice in case you live in a dangerous part of the world. If that’s the case though, you might want to keep a low profile and not spend 3 million Euros ($3.3 million) on a car that will definitely attract a lot of attention to you and your loved ones.
Of course, there are several other interesting features inside this bulletproof Rolls-Royce Phantom, such as a new entertainment system, a new sound system and so on. What’s surprising though is that there’s no mention of an upgrade under the hood. Sure, the 6.75-liter twin turbo V12 of the standard Rolls-Royce Phantom is able to carry more than just the 2.6 tons of the standard car but then again, a bit more power never hurt, especially since this stretched version is definitely also heavier.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world's first skincare brand to use artificial intelligence is coming to Ireland.
Skinmade is a German company that uses advanced technology and artificial intelligence to measure and understand the skin's individual needs.
Specific ingredients are then selected to offer products optimally designed for the skin.
Skinmade founder Dr. Lars Rüther said: “Originally we were working with this technology in the Fraunhofer-Institute in Germany, when we realised the potential to use this intelligence for personalised skincare.
"Today we are absolutely at the forefront of this capability within the worldwide skincare industry.
"One day we will all look back and think it is crazy that we all used to use the same generic skincare products as each other, instead of having individual products that are designed specifically for us, by our own skin. Products that are Skinmade.”
Customers can book a Skinmade reading at Akina Beauty Clinic on Leeson Street in Dublin.

    <h5 class="mb-1">My favorite cases for the iPhone 11 Pro</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s brand-new iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max handsets are beautiful – both to the eyes and to the touch – but all it takes is one good drop to put an end to that seemingly short-lived appreciation. That’s why I always use a case.
Given just how many case options there are on the market today, both from no name manufacturers and from well recognized brands, it seemed like a wonderful opportunity to go over some of my favorite cases that I’ve enjoyed using since splurging on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro this Fall.
I like to keep half of a dozen cases or so on hand at any point in time because different cases have varying features that make certain ones more ideal for what I’m doing any particular day. If I know I’m going to be somewhere rough or rugged, then I’ll use a thicker case; otherwise, I levitate toward something thinner. Some of my cases include added utility that I’ll go over in this piece.
After taking a moment to think about the cases I use the most and why, these were my obvious choices:
Topping today’s list is the Speck Presidio Grip, a highly versatile case that meets slenderness somewhere in the middle with military grade drop protection of up to 13 feet and a pocket-friendly 1.2cm at its thickest point when installed.
Speck’s Presidio series cases come equipped with a proprietary rubberized bumper technology that they call Impactium, and I have yet to experience a drop where it hasn’t helped my iPhone land safely. I’d even go as far as to call this my daily driver given just how often I use it.
My favorite feature of the Presidio Grip case is what’s in the name – the grip. So many cases on the market are either too slippery or catch too much of my pocket when I pull my iPhone out. The Grip’s hard plastic rear shell combined with the subtle rubber rubbing is the perfect compromise, and it feels great in my hand.
Pros:
Cons:
You can pick up a Speck Presidio Grip case for your iPhone 11 Pro for anywhere from $22-40 on Amazon, depending on the colorway.
The second runner-up to my favorite case above is the Nomad Active Rugged Case, a sporty option that combines the luxury of leather with the performance of 6-foot drop protection while maintaining a pocketable 1.2cm at its thickest point when installed.
Nomad is known for their use of Horween leather in many of their cases, but this is the first time they’ve deviated to something new. The Nomad Active Rugged Case takes advantage of German Heinen leather, and unlike Horween leather, Nomad’s Heinen-wrapped case sports hydrophobic qualities that make it uncompromisingly luxurious in damp environments.
Albeit not the most protective case on this list, Nomad’s Active Rugged Case brings decent drop protection with a slim form factor and premium materials. It’s great for the office life, but it can be used confidently on outdoor excursions. Nomad even includes a lanyard loop near the iPhone’s speakers to prevent drops entirely.
Pros:
Cons:
Limited colors of the Nomad Active Rugged Leather case are available on Amazon for as little as $45, but you can find the full assortment of color options on Nomad’s website for $50.
Another case I like to keep in my arsenal is the Mophie Juice Pack Access, a case that couples an integrated Qi-enabled battery pack with high-tech USB-C-based pass-through charging. Measuring about 1.8cm at its thickest point when installed, this pocketable case is on the beefier side of things, but for all the right reasons.
I wouldn’t go as far as to say that I’d trust this case in a dropping contest, but it definitely has some rigidity to it that would make me confident in protecting against small drops – perhaps from my waist when exiting my car. But clearly, drop protection isn’t this case’s takeaway feature.
As an avid Pokémon GO player, my iPhone’s battery almost always seems to need more juice after just a few hours, and this case extends my handset’s battery life more than two-fold. Best of all, it charges either with a wireless Qi-enabled charger or with a USB-C cable, and the latter is particularly tempting given just how much I wish the iPhone would ditch Lightning in place of USB-C.
Pros:
Cons:
The Mophie Juice Pack Access is available for $80 on Amazon with Prime shipping.
By far the chunkiest case on this list is the OtterBox Defender Pro, a case that shares its roots with the iconic OtterBox Defender but stands apart with its integration of an anti-microbial coating that resists germs and stains better than the former. Holster included, this case measures almost 3.5cm thick at its thickest point when installed, or just 1.5cm without the holster.
The OtterBox Defender Pro is far from my daily driver, but I trust its beefiness when carrying out tasks that would otherwise be dangerous for my iPhone, such as working on my car, hiking, or zip-lining. What’s more is the port protectors keep water and dust out of the Lightning port and ringer/silent switch. In most high-risk situations, I’d trust this case over most others.
As an added bonus, the holster’s clip doubles as a kickstand, enabling effortless Netflix binge-watching when you get home to unwind. What’s more is these cases don’t integrate a chintzy screen protector anymore, so you’re free to use your favorite tempered glass option instead.
Pros:
Cons:
If you’re serious about protecting your pricey investment, then you can buy an OtterBox Defender Pro case from the manufacturer’s website for $71. The case comes in a variety of colors to match any taste.
Whenever I’m in an environment relaxed enough not to necessitate any form of drop protection, but still want some form of scratch protection from being set on a tabletop or otherwise, I turn to my Pitaka Air Case, a premium minimalist case made of 600D aramid fiber that adds just 0.06cm of thickness to a naked iPhone 11 Pro.
It’s rare that I’m daring enough to go this minimalistic with my $1,000 iPhone, but if I do, I do it with Pitaka’s Air Case. It’s so thin that the iPhone quite literally feels naked in my hand, apart from the fabulous silky feel that the case seems to emanate in one’s hand, which offers a satisfying grip.
The one thing I disliked about this case was the plastic camera bezel that made my iPhone ‘floppy’ on a flat surface, so I pulled it off the case. The manufacturer probably wouldn’t recommend doing this since the lenses protrude from this impossibly thin case without the bezel, but I think it makes the user experience a whole lot nicer, especially if I’m in an environment where I don’t really have to worry about damage.
Pros:
Cons:
Fellow minimalists can pick up a Pitaka Air Case for $60 from Amazon with Prime shipping.
When it comes to smartphone cases, some people prefer minimalism over protection, and others are just the opposite. I’m somewhat moderate on the matter, and that’s why I like to have such a strong variety for different occasions.
While these are certainly my favorite cases to use, I’m curious to know what my readers’ favorite iPhone cases might be. Please feel free to comment about yours below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New to Mac? 15 tips and tricks for macOS beginners</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When you get your first Mac, you spend some time getting used to it. You figure out where items are located, set up apps like Messages and Mail, and prop a cool wallpaper on the screen.
After a while, you might be ready to learn some shortcuts for using Mac that help you do things faster or easier. So for you, we have this big list of tips and tricks for macOS beginners.
Whether you’re composing an email or writing up a note, you might be unsure how to spell a word. Rather than use a dictionary, just use a keyboard shortcut F5. This will show you words starting with the letters you’ve typed so far. Then you can just select the word you want and keep writing.
You don’t have to open the Calculator to do calculations. For simple equations, you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide using Spotlight Search. Just open the Search and pop in the calculation you want.
If you’re used to using Control + Alt + Delete on Windows to force quit an application, you’ll need to get used to a different shortcut on macOS. Hit Command + Option + Escape to open the force quit window.
Another cool shortcut you can use on Mac is to delete files. Instead of dragging them to the Trash or using the right-click shortcut menu, just select the item and hit Command + Delete.
Mac has a cool tool for capturing your screen that you can access with Command + Shift + 5. But for a fast screenshot of your entire screen, just use Command + Shift + 3.
If you start each day by opening the same apps on your Mac, you can make this much easier. Set up your Mac so that the same apps open automatically when you start your computer.
Open System Preferences > Users & Groups. Select your username and click Login Items at the top. You can then check the boxes for those apps in the list or add more using the plus sign button.
If you need to use a letter that has an accent, you don’t have to search for a special character. Just press and hold the key on your keyboard. A selection of accented letters based on that key will display for you to pick the one you want.
You have a really cool collection of emojis along with special characters on your Mac. And without jumping through hoops, you can open them with a keyboard shortcut. Press Control + Command + Space and the window will pop open.
While the menu bar is handy for navigation, there may be a time when it gets in your way. Luckily there’s a simple way to keep it hidden when you don’t need it.
Open System Preferences > General. Towards the top, check the box for Automatically hide and show the menu bar. You should immediately see your menu bar vanish. To show it again, just move your cursor to the top of the screen.
You can easily increase or decrease the volume on your Mac using Fn with the volume buttons. But if you want to change the volume in smaller increments, hold Shift + Option with Fn and the volume buttons. You’ll see the indicators for the volume move in smaller amounts.
If you’re switching from a Windows computer, then you’re used to having both Delete and Backspace keys on your keyboard. Delete removes letters forward and Backspace removes letters backward.
But on Mac, you only have Delete, which works like Backspace removing letters backwards. So if you want to remove letters forward, use the keyboard shortcut Fn + Delete.
While you can use tabs in Finder to view multiple windows, you might open new ones without thinking to use tabs. But you can easily clear up the clutter by merging your open Finder windows.
With them all open and active, click Window > Merge All Windows from the menu bar. You’ll then see all of your open Finder windows combined into one using tabs for each.
You can easily rename files one by one, but if you want to rename a group of files to something similar, there’s a fast way to do it. Select the files you want to rename, right-click, and choose Rename X Items. You’ll get a pop-up window where you can replace the text in the current filenames with whatever you like.
Create more workspace on your Mac by using the Split View feature. This lets you put two apps side-by-side in a full-screen view.
Put your cursor over the green button on the top left of the first app’s window. You can then choose to put that window on the left or right of the screen. Once you do, you’ll see which windows are available to use on the other side of the screen. Just click the one you want and you’ll be in Split View.
If you work with a dual monitor setup, you can put your Dock on whichever screen you want. The Dock will move automatically to your active window.
Go to the second screen and click to make it the active one, then move your cursor to where your Dock would be (bottom, left, or right). Your Dock will pop right up on that other screen.
Hopefully one or more of these Mac tips and tricks for beginners will be something you find useful. Be sure to let us know in the comments!
And if you have shortcuts of your own like these that you’d like to share with other macOS beginners, feel free to share it below or hit us up on Twitter!

You can easily rename files one by one, but if you want to rename a group of files to something similar, there’s a fast way to do it. Select the files you want to rename, right-click, and choose Rename X Items. You’ll get a pop-up window where you can replace the text in the current filenames with whatever you like.
Create more workspace on your Mac by using the Split View feature. This lets you put two apps side-by-side in a full-screen view.
Put your cursor over the green button on the top left of the first app’s window. You can then choose to put that window on the left or right of the screen. Once you do, you’ll see which windows are available to use on the other side of the screen. Just click the one you want and you’ll be in Split View.
If you work with a dual monitor setup, you can put your Dock on whichever screen you want. The Dock will move automatically to your active window.
Go to the second screen and click to make it the active one, then move your cursor to where your Dock would be (bottom, left, or right). Your Dock will pop right up on that other screen.
Hopefully one or more of these Mac tips and tricks for beginners will be something you find useful. Be sure to let us know in the comments!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Update (9/12/2019): Minecraft: Bedrock Edition has been officially confirmed for PS4. This means you'll be able to play cross-platform with those using other hardware. It also grants access to the Minecraft Marketplace, where you can find new skins, worlds, and other bits and bobs. Anyone who already owns Minecraft on PS4 will be able to upgrade to the Bedrock Edition for free. The update will be rolling out this week.
Original Story: After a prolonged period of absence, it appears that the cross-platform Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will release on the PlayStation 4 from 10th December. This means that, in an unprecedented move, you'll be required to login to an Xbox account on Sony's system to experience the title to its fullest. Revived boxart for the behemoth includes both a Sony Interactive Entertainment logo and an Xbox Game Studios logo.
The refreshed retail release will ship with a LittleBigPlanet mash-up pack, as well as various other in-game goodies, such as the Greek Mythology mash-up pack. The strangest thing here is that, assuming it's like the Nintendo Switch version, there'll be Xbox achievements for this re-released PS4 edition, as well as the usual roster of Trophies. Expect an official announcement during State of Play next week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following rumours late last week of a supposed Bayonetta and Vanquish remaster making its way to current-gen consoles, the release has now finally been confirmed for a PlayStation 4 launch with a glitzy reveal trailer. Both games release on 18th February 2020, and physical buyers can snag a steelbook edition if they feel so inclined.
The package brings together two of Platinum Games' very best titles of the previous generation with 4K visuals and a boost in framerate to 60. You'll be able to purchase them separately or as a bundle on the PlayStation Store for $39.99, and pre-ordering digitally nets you two exclusive themes. Not bad at all considering 2020 is looking rather quiet before the March onslaught.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Feature: 6 PS4 Announcements to Expect During This Week's State of Play</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sony’s set to close out 2019 with one last State of Play broadcast, and clocking in at over 20 minutes, we’re hoping for a humdinger ahead of the holidays. While the manufacturer is remaining tight-lipped regarding the nature of the pre-recorded stream, there are a few rumours flying around that we figured were worth sharing. In this article, we’re going to share six PlayStation 4 announcements that we expect from the Japanese giant’s next Nintendo Direct-inspired briefing.
Resident Evil 3 is the worst kept secret in gaming and is guaranteed to be a part of the next State of Play broadcast. While speculation has been surrounding the PSone remake for several months now, leaked cover art scraped from the PlayStation Store’s servers proves that pre-orders are poised to go live any day. As journalist Geoff Keighley has ruled the release out from The Game Awards, there’s only one place this can be revealed. Expect a trailer, release date, and some kind of update on how multiplayer spin-off Project Resistance will be involved.
Sucker Punch’s samurai open worlder Ghost of Tsushima has been keeping its head down for almost 18 months, prompting many to speculate that it’s now a PlayStation 5 launch title. Sony insists that’s not the case, though, and updates to the exclusive’s YouTube playlist suggest we may get a brand new look at the historical outing this week. Don’t expect much more than a trailer, but seeing as the release has been dormant for so long, we’ll take anything at this stage.
Media Molecule has ended Dreams’ period of Early Access, meaning that a release is imminent. One retailer in the UK believes that the title’s officially due out on 14th February, and that seems plausible to us. As part of this, we’ll probably get an extended look at the developer’s included single player campaign, which is set to ship as part of the full package. Of course, the real beauty of this game will be everything that happens post-launch.
The Last of Us: Part II should be a couple of months away; instead we’re going to have to wait a good half year for it. The chances of you forgetting about Ellie’s sophomore outing are slim to none, but Sony’s going to want to keep the game at the front of your brain. Don’t expect much from the Naughty Dog developed effort this week, but a short teaser trailer shouldn’t be out of the question.
It’s one of the biggest hits of 2019, and it looks like it could honk to PS4 before the end of the year. Untitled Goose Game’s various Trophies are already live in Sony’s servers, suggesting a release on the Japanese giant’s device is imminent. We reckon this could be a shadow drop, available on the PlayStation Store immediately after the State of Play. If that’s not the case, then we don’t think we’ll be waiting long; a release prior to Christmas would be fantastic festive news.
We’re long overdue an update on PlayStation VR’s software schedule. We know that Marvel's Iron Man VR is coming, and we’d expect to see a brand new trailer for that – but Sony seems to have run out of big name titles beyond the Camouflaj developed superhero outing. We need a slate of releases to look forward to in 2020, so let’s hope State of Play delivers one or two titles that deserve to be on our radar.

    <h5 class="mb-1">To the Surprise of No One, PS5 Will Have Exclusive Games</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When isn’t there a furore on gaming forums? There’s a lot of discussion at the moment regarding comments made by trusted Kotaku scribe Jason Schreier, who teased on a Split Screen podcast that the PlayStation 5 will have exclusive first-party games at launch. Surprising? Not really, but it sounds like Xbox will be following a different philosophy, with cross-gen titles playable on both Project Scarlett and the Xbox One family when it releases its own new box next year.
Talking about next-gen development, Schreier said that he believes most third-party titles are being developed with both the PS5 and PS4 in mind – as is often the case during a hardware transition. However, he added the following: “Some of the stuff I've heard about is PS5 only. I haven't heard anything about Xbox first-party games, but I'm sure their stuff is going to be on as much stuff [as possible]. Actually, they already said Halo: Infinite is going to be cross-gen, so Microsoft I'm sure will be much less about exclusives.”
Schreier reiterated the comments when asked to comment on social media:
Sony has been very clear in recent interviews that it still believes in generations, so there should be no surprise that it’s creating games exclusively for its new hardware. And that should be good news for anyone planning to purchase the system, as you can pretty much guarantee it’s going to be utilised to its fullest out of the box. As for what the games are, well, the expectation is that Bluepoint’s strongly speculated Demon’s Souls Remake is one, while there suddenly seems to be a ton of discourse revolving a new Ratchet & Clank from Insomniac. All should be revealed soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sony Wants to Make Every PS5 Game Multiplayer with Cloud Controller Sharing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The USPTO has been very busy lately, approving and publishing several patents from Sony Interactive Entertainment. With PlayStation 5 on the horizon, it's always interesting to look at these, as they could possibly give us a glimpse at what the future holds. Just last week, we learned about a proposed PS5 controller device that could give you contextual information dependent on where you are. Now, it seems Sony wants us all playing together more often -- even in single player titles.
This patent details the ability to split a set of controls up and assign segments to up to four players, either locally or online. For example, player one is on the sticks, player two has the face buttons, and player three is in charge of the triggers. You'd each have a PS5 controller, but you'd each be in charge of certain commands. It sounds mad, and it might be fun for certain types of games, but we're not sold on this one.
However, the other aspect of this patent sounds more interesting. Using the cloud, players may be able to swap total control from one to another, say after a certain period of time. This would mean you and some friends could all play, for example, Uncharted's single player campaign "together", periodically swapping who's in charge of the on-screen action. This doesn't sound dissimilar to Share Play, functionality on PS4 in which players can view and join in with each other's games. It seems this patent is a progression of this tech.
What do you think of all this? Would you like to share controls with your pals in PS5 games? Let everyone have a turn in the comments below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Which PS4 games support cross-play with rival consoles Xbox One and Nintendo Switch? Sony was underfire for a long time regarding its reluctance to support cross-play, but following an open beta featuring a handful of tentpole titles, the company now allows developers to support the oft-requested feature without any restrictions. Below you'll find a list of all PS4 games with cross-console play, which we'll update as more software gets added.
Here are all the PS4 games currently confirmed to be compatible with cross-console play:
There's a long, long list of titles that are already perfect to take advantage of this updates, but the likes of Overwatch, Minecraft, and Destiny 2 must surely be first on the agenda. Other contenders include the likes of Warframe, Grand Theft Auto V, and Monster Hunter: World.
Which game do you want to gain cross-console compatibility the most? Are you looking forward to playing against Nintendo Switch and Xbox One users? Share the love in the comments below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tool Illegally Enables Windows 7 Extended Security Updates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A method has been discovered that allows Windows 7 users to bypass eligibility checks and receive Extended Security Updates even if they have not paid for a license.
On January 14, 2020, Windows 7 will reach end of support (EoS), which normally means that Microsoft will no longer offer security updates for the operating system.
As many business and enterprise users are not able to switch from Windows 7 before EoS, Microsoft introduced a paid-for service called Extended Security Updates (ESU) that allows licensed users to continue to receive security updates.
While some devices, such as voting systems, can get this service for free for a limited time, other business users who have a volume licensing agreement would need to purchase a license for $25 to $200 per device depending on the Windows and the year of the program.
To use the Windows 7 Extended Security Updates service, users need to activate ESU on their Windows 7 devices using the license key issued to them by Microsoft.
In a post to the MyDigitalLife forums, a user has uploaded a tool called BypassESU that bypasses the ESU license checks so that users can get the updates for free.
It does this by patching the operating system so that ESU license checks always return true, meaning that the device is properly licensed..
This bypass has been tested and shown to work by utilizing the Windows 7 KB4528069 update, which is used to test whether the device is properly configured to receive Extended Security Updates.
When installed, if ESU is not properly setup on the device, the update will fail to install. On the other hand, if ESU is configured or the bypass is run, the update will install successfully.
While it may be tempting to use this bypass in order to continue to receive Windows 7 security updates after EoS, it is important to remember that using the bypass is illegal.
By using this tool, users are circumventing license restrictions placed by Microsoft in order to get a paid-for product for free.
Instead of using this crack, Windows 7 users should upgrade to Windows 10, which can still be done for free.
Furthermore, by using scripts like these that install DLLs and make modifications to the proper operation of the operating system, you are putting yourself at risk for malware or other types of attacks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TrickBot Trojan Abuses Google Suite, Baits With Annual Bonuses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A recently active malicious campaign baited targets with phishing messages promising annual bonuses, abusing Google Suite cloud services to infect them with Trickbot banking Trojan payloads.
TrickBot (aka TrickLoader, Trickster, and TheTrick) is a modular information stealer regularly upgraded with new capabilities and modules since October 2016 when it was first spotted in the wild by Malwarebytes Labs' malware analyst Jérôme Segura.
This campaign's bait emails were sent using the legitimate SendGrid cloud-based email delivery platform in an attempt to conceal their malicious nature, as well as to obfuscate the links used throughout the infection chain as researchers at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 found.
The attackers employed embedded links to legitimate Google Docs documents that redirected the potential victims to a Google Drive download link. By clicking this link, the targets would be served with a downloader tool designed to drop the final Trickbot payload on the victims' computers.
The attackers used compromised .edu emails to send the phishing emails through SendGrid's Email Delivery Service (EDS) and bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEG) deployed on their targets' networks.
"The body of the emails contained lure text consistent with the subject lines and links that utilized a SendGrid function called Click Tracking which sends a notification back to the sender of the email for tracking purposes," the Unit 42 researchers discovered.
To deliver the Trickbot payloads, the campaign operators used two downloader variants, based on the phishing email's theme: StatementReport.exe in the case of annual bonus baits and Preview_Report.exe for payroll phishing messages.
"Due to default settings in most Windows deployments of not displaying file extensions, these files will not appear as obvious executables to a victim," the researchers add.
Once executed, the downloaders would display an "IMPORTANT" decoy pop-up asking the victims to update their Microsoft Word installation or to open the document on another computer.
Regardless of what the victim does (dismisses the pop-up or not), the Trickbot payload gets dropped from first stage command and control (C2) servers owned by legitimate organizations — another attempt to avoid detection — to the Temp folder and gets executed.
Once launched, the Trickbot Trojan will load itself into memory using process hollowing after spawning a svchost.exe process to camouflage as a legitimate program and further attempt to evade detection.
Next, the malware starts collecting system information which it sends to its second stage C2 server and requests additional modules, while also gaining persistence by creating a "System cache service" scheduled task that auto-starts on logon and checks every 11 minutes if it's already running on a compromised system.
A full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to this campaign and including downloader and payload samples, as well as Trickbot payload URLs are available at the end of Unit 42's report.
Last month, Unit 42's research team also spotted an updated Trickbot password grabber module that could be used to harvest OpenSSH private keys and OpenVPN passwords and configuration files.
The Google Docs online word processor was previously used in Trickbot campaigns as discovered by Cofense researchers in August when Trickbot payloads were delivered onto unsuspecting victims' devices via executables camouflaged as PDF documents with .pdf.exe extensions.
The phishing messages delivered via that malspam campaign used legitimate messages generated by sharing a Google Docs document with the targets, containing fake 404 error messages and links to the malicious payloads.
TrickBot is one of today's most aggressive malware after switching places with Emotet as the most distributed strain via malspam before the latter was revived during August [1, 2].

    <h5 class="mb-1">The new BioShock game is nearly half a decade into development</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This morning, when 2K Games revealed the existence of a new studio, Cloud Chamber, it also took the opportunity to unveil the developer's first title. It's the fourth BioShock game, a series that has been largely dormant since BioShock Infinite released in early 2013.
The way the announcement went, you're meant to think that all of this is a very brand new development. That's not exactly the case. Kotaku has followed this story for quite some time now, providing proof that the roots of the next BioShock stretch back nearly half a decade.
The fourth BioShock originally started in 2015 (but possibly even earlier than that) at Certain Affinity in Austin, Texas. Certain Affinity is a studio that has made a name for itself supporting triple-A shooters. It has assisted on franchises like Call of Duty, Halo, and Doom.
Nothing will ever come of Certain Affinity's time with BioShock because 2K took the project in-house in 2017 and rebooted the whole effort. That's when 2K originally formed what's now Cloud Chamber. Back then, it was a mysterious small team next to Mafia III developer Hangar 13, and the rumbling was that it was working on something BioShock-related. Hangar 13 employees competed with one another to switch teams -- both because BioShock is one of 2K's biggest properties, and because Hangar 13 didn't have a great sense of job security; it underwent an aggressive round of layoffs in February 2018.
When 2K says it has started working on the next BioShock, that's technically true. But that work started years ago. However, all that time was presumably spent figuring things out on a conceptual level, a small group of creatives brainstorming the future of the series. 2K makes it perfectly clear that the next game is still years away. Now that 2K is comfortable enough to formally announce it, we can probably expect development as we imagine it to actually ramp up -- hundreds of people all doing their small individual parts to collectively create a giant video game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A weird glitch all but confirms Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's battle royale mode</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rumors have been swirling for quite some time now that Activision eventually plans to add a battle royale mode to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. There are two pillars supporting this rumor, each steeped in their own sort of logic. First, last year's Blackout mode in Black Ops 4 was a huge hit and it's not a stretch that Activision would revisit it. More concrete, data miners have already unearthed evidence that a battle royale exists.
A Modern Warfare player recently found himself high in the heavens in a way that seems to further confirm battle royale is coming. Reddit user Nateberg3 posted this video of him hovering over a giant map that isn't in the game. He was loading into a Spec Ops match when he was mysteriously transported atop this newfound area. When compared to the stuff that the data miners dug up, everything seems to check out. The locations match up like they should.
So, it's probably just a matter of time until Activision makes this official. The prevalent theories are that: it'll launch in early 2020, it'll be standalone and free-to-play, and that it'll support 200 players. Also, Raven Software is said to be working on it, meaning that Infinity Ward's left to focus on supporting the traditional multiplayer side of Modern Warfare.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Official Switch GameCube remotes can go for upward of $80.
You know the drill. Nintendo releases a limited run of something, scalpers go crazy, Nintendo drags their feet on reprints and the world continues to turn. It's been a while since we've seen the resurgence of the GameCube Super Smash Bros. Edition controller, but thanks to a listing update on the official Nintendo UK Store, there's now hope.
The listing notes that "new stock will be due to dispatch" in late January 2020, a year and a month after the original release of the hardware. Note that the price is £24.99, which is roughly $32 US. Worldwide restocks might be imminent!
Not a moment too soon: I play exclusively with these, and own four from my time with the Wii U edition of Smash, as well as a few for Switch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oculus Quest now has hand tracking</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Oculus Quest just got that much more enticing. With update v12, the standalone VR headset now has motion tracking – a taste of it, at least. The functionality is currently limited to "select first-party apps" (like the browser and Oculus TV) and the Home interfaces (like the Library and Store), but considering hand tracking wasn't even supposed to launch until next year, it's a nice early present.
Another handy feature? You can now change your floor height without a controller.
"Simply update your Quest software to v12 when it rolls out to you, then turn on hand tracking in the Experimental Features menu to be among the first to try it," the company said in a blog post.
"To switch between your hands and Touch controllers, just use the new toggle switch in your Oculus Home menu," Oculus continued. "And this is just the beginning. We'll continue to add new features and functionality to improve the experience of hand tracking on Quest in 2020."
Next week, the company will roll out a software development kit (SDK) to developers, so Oculus Quest owners can expect to see more hands-free interactions sooner than later. Some games are inherently going to demand controllers and the input methods they provide, but this is a big step for VR.
I can't tell you how many virtual-reality games I've played where everything just would've flowed better if only I could've used my hands to interact with the world like I would in real life. It's too late in the cycle for me to want to buy an Oculus Quest, but I'm excited about hand-tracking possibilities down the line. I mean, I'll get another headset eventually. As for Oculus Rift and Rift S owners, you're out of luck here.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's taken some time, but the PS4 port of globally-popular build-'em-up Minecraft will be updated to the "Bedrock Edition" tomorrow, finally allowing the same cross-play features that the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and mobile editions have been enjoying for almost two years.When PlayStation first rolled out its own cross-play capabilities, the brand drew ire from fans for not teaming up with its contemporaries on games such as Minecraft and Fortnite, coincidentally two of the biggest games in the world. Although Sony would eventually relent and allow cross-play for Fortnite, (along with other major releases such as Rocket League and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare), PS4 owners would remain locked out of the global Minecraft party.Once the free update goes live, PS4 Minecraft players will be able to play, build and interact with users on PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and mobile, further widening the community and no doubt increasing the game's global reputation. It should be noted that, speaking with Eurogamer, Microsoft confirmed that PS4 players will require a Microsoft or Xbox login in order to use the crossplay feature.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Patch Tuesday alert! Protect your machine by pausing updates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The past couple of months have gone reasonably well in the Automatic Update world — we saw a convincing Keystone Kops rendition in September, which continued into October, but November was relatively benign (unless you’re using Access). 
My guess is that December will be relatively quiet, too, because so many Microsofties are on vacation. But you never know. Microsoft, eh?
Yes, you have to get patched eventually. But there’s very little reason to jump head first into the pernicious patching pit. Get Automatic Update disentangled for a while — defer it, pause it, put a cork in it — and wait while we all watch the unpaid beta-testers take one for the Gipper.
If you’re using Windows 7 or 8.1, click Start > Control Panel > System and Security. Under Windows Update, click the "Turn automatic updating on or off" link. Click the "Change Settings" link on the left. Verify that you have Important Updates set to "Never check for updates (not recommended)" and click OK.
Not sure which version of Win10 you’re running? Down in the Search box, near the Start button, type About, then click About your PC. The version number appears on the right under Windows specifications.
If you’re on Win10 version 1803, it’s time to pack your bags and move on. Microsoft’s pushing hard to get your machine to version 1909 right now, but you don’t have to dance to the ‘Softies' tune. I talk about your options in "Running Win10 version 1803 or 1809? You have options. Here’s how to control your upgrade." Once you've decided where to land, move on to 1809 or 1903 or 1909 before you temporarily block this month’s patches. @PKCano has a newly updated list of 1803 upgrade deferral settings and their effects on AskWoody.
If you’re using Win10 Pro version 1809, I recommend an update blocking  technique that Microsoft shows for “Broad Release” in its obscure Build deployment rings for Windows 10 updates — which is intended for admins, but applies to you, too. (Thx, @zero2dash.)
Step 1. Using an administrative account, click Start > Settings > Update & Security. 
Step 2. On the left, choose Windows Update. On the right, click the link for Advanced options. You see the settings in the screenshot. 
Step 3. The first box — “Semi-Annual Channel” — is no longer recognized by Microsoft. It has changed the terminology over and over again. In our newly redefined update world, choosing “Semi-Annual Channel” adds 60 days to the “feature update” setting discussed in the next step. I recommend that you nod, wink and, in the first box, choose Semi-Annual Channel.
Step 4. To further delay new versions until they’ve been minimally tested, roll the “feature update” deferral setting all the way up to 365 days. That tells the Windows Updater (unless Microsoft makes another “mistake,” as it has numerous times in the past) that it should wait until 425 days after a new version is released (60 days for Semi-Annual Channel + 365 days deferral) before upgrading and re-installing Windows on your machine.
Of course, nobody expects Microsoft to refrain from upgrading your 1809 machine until July 19, 2020 ( = version 1903 release date + 425 days): Even though those settings appear here, Microsoft has already warned that it’s going to push your 1809 machine onto 1909. We just don’t know exactly how hard it's going to push quite yet.
My production machines are still on 1809, awaiting the results of this month’s 1903 patches — I'm still not convinced that 1903 is stable enough — so don’t feel left out if you haven’t yet moved on. If you’d like to block a forced upgrade to 1909 for the foreseeable future, follow the instructions in How to block the Windows 10 November 2019 Update, version 1909, from installing.
Step 5. To delay cumulative updates, set the “quality update” deferral to 15 days or so. (“Quality update” = cumulative update = bug fix.) In my experience, Microsoft usually yanks bad Win10 cumulative updates within a couple of weeks of their initial release. By setting this to 10 or 15 or 20 days, Win10 will update itself after the major screams of pain have subsided and (with some luck) the bad cumulative updates have been pulled or reissued. Notably, in February 2019, it took Microsoft 18 days to fix its first-Tuesday bugs.
Step 6. Just “X” out of the settings pane. You don’t need to explicitly save anything.
In the past I’ve recommended that you avoid clicking “Check for updates” simply because, up until a few months ago, clicking “Check for updates” would automatically install everything Microsoft had backed up for your machine, without giving you a chance to peruse the items on offer. It now appears as if Microsoft has seen the error of its ways, and no longer crams everything on your machine, should you have the temerity to “Check.” Still, I’m a superstitious old cuss with a long memory. I won’t be clicking “Check for updates” any time soon.
If there are any real howlers — months where the cumulative updates were irretrievably bad, and never got any better, as they were in July 2018 — we’ll let you know, loud and clear. 
If you have Win10 Home, version 1809, your only reasonable option (other than installing a third-party patch blocker) is to set your internet connection to “metered.” Metered connections are an update-blocking kludge that seems to work to fend off cumulative updates, but as best I can tell still doesn’t have Microsoft’s official endorsement as a cumulative update prophylactic. Worryingly, there are some reports that Microsoft is pushing for upgrades even if they go over metered connections.
To set your Ethernet connection as metered: Using an administrator account, click Start > Settings > Network & Internet. On the left, choose Ethernet. On the right, click on your Ethernet connection. Then move the slider for Metered connection to On.
To set your Wi-Fi connection as metered: Using an administrator account, click Start > Settings > Network & Internet. On the left, choose Wi-Fi. On the right, click on your Wi-Fi connection. Move the slider for Metered connection to On.
If you set your internet connection to metered, you need to watch closely as the month unfolds, and judge when it’s safe to let the demons in the door. At that point, turn “metered” off, and just let your machine update itself. 
I’m close to installing 1903 on my production machines, but haven’t yet made the plunge. It still hasn’t been stable enough, for long enough, to get my wholehearted endorsement. If you’ve already upgraded to 1903 or 1909, though, your patching life is considerably simpler. 
In version 1903 or 1909 (either Home or Pro), using an administrator account, click Start > Settings > Update & Security. At the top, click the Pause updates for 7 days button. 
That button changes so it says Pause updates for 7 more days. Click it two more times, for a total of 21 paused days. That defers all updates on your machines until 21 days after you click the button. Once set, you can’t extend the deferral any longer unless you install all the outstanding cumulative updates to that point.
Historically, 21 days has sufficed to avoid the worst problems.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to use Google Drive on iPhone, iPad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s Files app is a fantastic solution for Apple users who need flexibility when it comes to the cloud storage services they use, as it supports iCloud, Dropbox, Box and Google Drive.
The promise of cloud storage systems is that it becomes easier to move between  different platforms efficiently. You might want to access files using your parent’s older Windows PC, even while using a MacBook Pro at home, a Chrome tablet when you travel and an iPhone the rest of the time.
Fortunately, it is becoming easier to access all of these systems – you might use iCloud with Windows, and can also turn to Google Drive with Windows, Mac and iOS systems, as well as Android devices such as that Chrome tablet.
While managing files across all these disparate platforms may sometimes be a little more complex, it makes it possible to stay productive in a platform-agnostic way.
At a very basic level, using Google Drive on iOS devices is simple: Download and install the app, login with your Google ID and you can begin to store items from your device to your Google Drive, which offers 15GB of free space.
The Files app makes this even simpler since, once you have downloaded Google’s app and logged into it, Google Drive will be made available as one of your Locations within the app. This makes accessing documents and other data you have stored in Google Drive as easy as finding anything else in Files. You do still need to open up the Google Drive app to access some of the service’s more sophisticated features, though.
You can also drag-and-drop content between the different storage services you may have enabled on your device, though you must wait for content to be downloaded to your iPhone first.
Changes made to any file in Google Drive on any of your computers or mobile devices will be updated across all your devices, of course.
If you use Google’s apps – Docs, Sheets, or Slides – and the apps are installed on your device, tapping on any Google document, spreadsheet or presentation in the Files app will open the app of the associated Google editor. 
If you don’t have these apps installed, they should open in a compatible app that you do have on your device – so long as the document format works. Here's a selection of tips to help you get more from using Google Docs on iOS devices.
Apple’s biggest weakness is the miserly amount of free storage it provides to iOS users; they get just 5GB of space in which to store their digital identity.
While most iOS users will spend a little money to increase the quantity of storage available, many choose to use alternative online storage services to supplement the free space they get.
With 15GB of storage, Google Drive can be a good way to store video and images captured on your device. You can choose to store every image, or just manually store those that you most want to keep safe.
Assuming you have installed Google Drive and are logged into your account:
If you want to store everything all the time, then you’ll need to install the Google Photos app. This lets you store an unlimited number of 16MP photos and 1,080HD videos for free – or upgrade to a subscription-based plan to backup images in their original image quality.
Once you’ve installed Google Photos and signed into your account, tap the Menu icon in the app and choose Settings>Back up & sync, which you should switch to On. You may need to give the app permission to access your Photos.
NB: It is also possible to back images up to your Google Drive. Open that app, and then enable Auto Backup in Settings>Backup.
You can also choose to backup contacts and calendar events here, though this may not be appropriate if you rely on Apple’s services for these tasks.
You can send files up to 15GB to others with Google Drive, though you’ll need to upload the files to your Drive first (and probably pay extra for storage if you hit the 15GB maximum free tier).
There are more hints for Google Drive collaboration here.
While the Files app is fine for accessing your information, you do get more features when you use the Google Drive app.
For example, when navigating files stored in Google Drive, if you press the triple dot icon to the right of the file name you can access tools to send and make copies, move files, rename and remove them and (I think most useful) an Available Offline item. This (at the risk of seeming obvious) you should use if you plan working with some files when you are offline.
At the top left of the Google Drive app you’ll see a box comprised of three straight lines. Tap this and you’ll be able to share folders, search for recent items and a range of other options.

When you are in the business of manufacturing, one problem you have to deal with is counterfeit products. They not only hurt your sales and spoil your brand name but these products can also cause harm to the user.
It has been reported that Xiaomi went on a raid with the police to an Indian market where it seized fake products worth 13 Lakhs (~$18,252). The raid was carried out at Delhi’s Gaffar Market after the Chinese manufacturer had filed a complaint at the Delhi Police.
An official statement put out by Xiaomi reads thus: “Police officers of Central District Karol Bagh Police Station along with the representatives of the company, conducted the raid where they seized over 2000+ fake Xiaomi products from four shop owners who were arrested for allegedly selling counterfeit Xiaomi products,”.
The confiscated products numbering more than 2000 include chargers, USB cables, power banks, headphones, and the popular Redmi AirDots wireless earbuds. Investigations revealed that the four culprits arrested have been in the business for years and sell in retail and wholesale to unsuspecting customers.
Xiaomi advises customers to check for proof of authenticity when buying products. Certain products such as power banks have a security code you can verify on the Mi website while other checks include logos on the product and packaging. We also advise you to buy from authorized distributors and the official Mi Store. Xiaomi also has Mi Express Kiosks, which are actually vending machines, in certain locations in India.

The Redmi K30 and Redmi K30 5G will launch tomorrow. The phones pack some pretty impressive features such as 30W fast charging that allows you to recharge the battery in just 1 hour. Redmi has also revealed that the Redmi K30 has a Hi-Res Audio Certification.
What this means is that sound output on the Redmi K30 series (with Hi-Res audio headphones) should be greater than CD-Quality. So if you have a subscription with platforms such as Tidal, then you should be able to enjoy Hi-Res audio tracks. Redmi says you should also get a better audio experience when playing games and watching movies.
The Redmi K30 series will launch alongside the Redmi Xiao AI Play Smart Speaker, and RedmiBook 13. The K30 will be a 4G phone powered by the Snapdragon 730G while the Redmi K30 5G will have Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor with an integrated 5G modem. Both phones will have LCD displays with a punch hole for dual-front facing cameras and a 120Hz refresh rate. There will be 64MP quad cameras on the back and a 4500mAh battery with support for 30W fast charging under the hood. They will also run Android 10 out of the box.

Xiaomi has launched a new product under the Youpin crowdfunding platform. It is a smart cat eye with a 5-inch IPS display. The device comes with a 369 yuan ($52) price tag and will start shipping on January 16, 2020.
The design of the Chuangmi Smart Cat Eye Doorbell comes in two different parts; one is a large smart display screen and the other is a camera placed on the door. The overall color tone is a relatively stable black.
The Smart Cat Eye camera is equipped with a 161 ° wide-angle camera, which has a wide field of view and can recognize the overall shape of outsiders and doesn’t just capture headshots. The camera also has a night vision function, which can identify visitors in the dark at night.
What’s more interesting is that Cat’s Eye can be paired with Xiaomi’s XiaoAI smart speakers. As long as someone knocks on the doorbell, you can directly view it in the smart speaker’s display in real-time. In this way, you can use the door camera without the 5-inch IPS large screen. However, the two components cannot be sold separately.
The camera is also a recorder that can perform 24-hour outdoor monitoring. It also comes with several AI features such as face recognition and human shape detection, thus reducing the false alarm rate.
In addition, the response voice can be changed during voice communication with guests. This feature is a good one especially for girls who live alone. This device can be linked with Mijia APP and other Mijia smart devices.

Last week, Vivo China confirmed that it will be launching the Vivo X30 series of 5G phones on Dec. 16. The X30 series is rumored to include at least two devices such as Vivo X30 and Vivo X30 Pro. Official teaser video and live shots of the Vivo X30 phone that surfaced in the recent past have revealed its design and color variants. A pair of new real-life images of the Vivo X30 smartphone have appeared on Weibo. The new images have not only showcased the front and rear design of the smartphone, but also they have revealed its key specifications.
The leaked hands-on images of the Vivo X30 show that it features a punch-hole display. The phone seems to be equipped with an in-screen fingerprint reader. The glass rear of the phone has a vertical triple camera setup at the top-left corner. Alongside it is the fourth lens with a squarish design. It seems to be a periscope lens and below it is a dual-tone LED flash. The text imprinted below the camera setup reveals that it will come with a 64-megapixel main camera.
The image of the Vivo X30’s display shows that it is running on Android 9 Pie OS. The operating system is overlaid with the all new JoviOS UI, a rebranded version of FunTouchOS. It remains to be seen whether the phone will be really arriving with JoviOS as the Chinese firm confirmed today that it will not be using the new name for its custom ROM.
The leaked image has further revealed that the Vivo X30 is powered by Samsung-made Exynos 980 chipset that includes a 2.2 GHz octa-core processor. The new chip will bring support for dual-mode 5G connectivity on the device. The SoC is assisted by 8 GB of RAM. The native storage of the X30 phone is 128 GB.
The leaked image has also revealed that the model number of the Vivo X30 smartphone is V1938T. The V1938T phone had received approval from the 3C authority of China. The 3C certification had revealed that the X30 phone may ship with a 33W rapid charger in China. Hopefully, the smartphone will appear with all its specifications on the database of China’s TENAA telecom authority in the next few days before its launch.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BySean- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
Qualcomm has recently officially unveiled its flagship chipset, the Snapdragon 865 SoC, alongside its mid-range Snapdragon 765G/ 765 processor which are manufactured using TSMC 7nm and Samsung’s 8nm processes. But questions arise as to why Qualcomm used two different processes and why the SD865 chip didn’t feature an integrated 5G modem, unlike the SD765G. And with the availability of EUV methods, why did the chipmaking company not utilize the new technology?
Keith Kressin, Senior Vice President of Product Management at Qualcomm, answered these questions in an interview. He stated that for each distinct chip many factors are taken into account. It includes technical parameters and commercial considerations such as power consumption, package size, wafer availability, speed of production and supply chain diversity.
From a technical standpoint, the performance between the processes produces similar power consumption and performance results; and with the shipments planned for the Snapdragon 865 and 765 being very large, commercial considerations were taken to ensure adequacy and diversity of supply. In other words, both Samsung and TSMC processes were used due to commercial constraints but, rest assured, deliver similar performance.
Kressin also went on to address why Snapdragon 865 doesn’t utilize the second-generation 7nm EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) technology. He stated that even if the new processing method is more efficient with production times, it does not have any real material impact on the end-user experience. For consumers, the most important aspect will always be power consumption and performance which will still be delivered regardless of production time. Furthermore, there is still some time before Qualcomm shifts to the new method to save time on production and processing.
Lastly, unlike the Snapdragon 765, the flagship SD865 is bundled with the X55 5G Modem while the former has an integrated X52 5G Modem. Although an integrated modem saves on battery life and space, the X55 modem on the SD865 improves on space consumption and power limitations without sacrificing power. In simpler terms, Qualcomm did not integrate a 5G modem in the SoC so it could provide the newer and faster X55 platform (which also does not suffer from issues related to non-integrated modems.)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ByHabeeb Onawole- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
OnePlus has announced a new TV remote for the OnePlus TV Q1 and OnePlus TV Q1 Pro. The new remote is called the Netflix Remote and that is because it has a dedicated Netflix button, unlike the one that currently ships with the TVs. It also has a completely new design. The good news is that existing customers get it for free.
The OnePlus Netflix Remote (RC-002A) is black with a polycarbonate body. It has a curvier design compared to the original remote but is also thicker, which is no surprise since it uses AAA batteries rather than a built-in rechargeable remote. The thickness is also an advantage has quite a number of reviews have complained about how uncomfortably thin the original remote is.
Gone is the squircle D-pad at the top. It has now been replaced with a circular navigation control that should be easier to use. There is a circular button in the middle of the d-pad that serves as the OK button.
The Netflix Remote also has its volume control buttons in a more accessible location rather than on the side. There is a Google Assistant button in between the volume buttons, and above it are the return and home buttons. There is a OnePlus button to access Oxygen Play as well as a mute button at the top right corner.
Even though this is called the Netflix Remote, there are dedicated buttons for Amazon’s Prime Video as well as YouTube. There is also an input source button to switch between inputs.
OnePlus says existing customers will get the Netflix Remote for free. All you have to do is follow the steps below:
OnePlus says only those who received the RC-001A (without Netflix Button) in the box are eligible for this remote. Based on this, there is a possibility, newer production units of the OnePlus TV series will ship with the new remote in the box rather than the rechargeable one.

The G8X ThinQ was launch in partnership with Japan’s Softbank and will be sold at some 5,000 stores in major Japanese cities. This is coming barely two months after the G8X ThinQ was first launched in September.
The LG G8X ThinQ is an updated version of the LG G8 ThinQ. It is the first LG phone to feature an in-screen fingerprint reader. The phone also features an improved edition of the DualScreen flip case. The updated DualScreen accessory has a waterdrop notch-enabled 6.4-inch display like the G8X ThinQ and it is also equipped with a 2.1-inch monochrome OLED display on its other side. The 360-degree hinge on the device allows users to view at any angle. While using the DualScreen with G8X ThinQ, users can make use of the second screen as a gamepad or a larger keyboard or it can be also used to accessed two apps side by side.

Xiaomi is hosting a launch event in China tomorrow, i.e. on 10th December where the company will be launching its much-anticipated 5G smartphone — Redmi K30. As the name itself suggests, it is a successor to Redmi K20.
While the Redmi K30 is getting launched tomorrow, its Pro variant, named Redmi K30 Pro is believed to get launched next year. Now, reports indicate that the upcoming Redmi K30 Pro smartphone will go official in March 2020.
Further, the report also adds that the smartphone will be powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 octa-core processor, coupled with Snapdragon X55 5G modem. Earlier reports have claimed 120Hz refresh rate for the phone’s display.
As for the Redmi K30, the smartphone is said to feature a 6.67-inch Full HD+ display with a punch-hole cut-out for housing front-facing camera sensors. The device will come with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for added security.
In terms of optics, the Redmi K30 will have a 64MP Sony IMX686 primary sensor and likely to be aided by a 13MP wide-angle lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and an 8MP telephoto lens. On the front, it could have a 32MP sensor and a ToF sensor for 3D face recognition.
The smartphone is expected to come powered by a 4,500mAh battery with 30W fast-charging support. While the 5G version of Redmi K30 will get a Snapdragon 765 SoC, the Redmi K30 4G model, which is expected to come to India, will likely be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G SoC.
The Snapdragon 765G chipset on the Redmi K30 will come with an integrated Snapdragon X52 5G modem that supports SA and NSA 5G dual-modes and fifth-generation Qualcomm AIE artificial intelligence engine.
To know more about the Redmi K30 smartphone, including its memory variants, pricing, and availability details, we’ll have to wait for a few more hours. The company also provide some details about the Redmi K30 Pro at the same event.

Redmi will be holding the launch event for the Redmi K30 series tomorrow, 10th December 2019. It is not strictly a smartphone conference and will also feature the new products from the company like its new notebook computer, RedmiBook. However, prior to the official announcement, the live images of the RedmiBook have already surfaced online.
According to the images, we can observe the design of the RedmiBook. The yet to be announced notebook features minimal bezels on surrounding the screen with a high screen to body ratio. Furthermore, RedmiBook is a relatively small laptop with a screen size closer to 13-inches. It is no surprise considering it was labeled as a “lightweight player” by the Xiaomi subsidiary, although larger variants might also be announced.
Under the hood, the RedmiBook is confirmed to arrive with top notch specifications. This includes the Intel Core i7 processor of the latest 10th Generation which features a maximum core frequency of 4.9GHz. For graphics, it will feature NVIDIA‘s MX250 graphics card with 2GB of VRAM that is great for gaming and productivity purposes. In other words, the specs show that it is a capable ultrabook.
Previously, we had reported on a new RedmiBook 13 laptop being launched on 12th December 2019, and these might be the same notebook in question. Notably, the company has already launched the 15.6 inch and 14 inch models which also featured similar specs with 10th Gen Intel processors. Lastly, the 14 inch Enhanced Edition carried a price tag of 3,299 Yuan, so the 13 inch model is could be priced similarly or lower than its larger variant.

Oppo’s sub-brand – Realme recently unveiled Realme X2 Pro featuring Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset and a high-end Super AMOLED display. Realme made an entry into an affordable premium smartphone market with the Realme X2 Pro. It is set to compete against the OnePlus 7T Pro and Redmi K20 Pro. Apart from the hardware specs, the third-party development has also become a reason before buying a smartphone. In today’s article, we will guide users to unlock the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro easily (RMX1931).
Unlocking the bootloader of any Android smartphone is like a window to unlimited customizations. It opens doors to rooting the device and installing third-party recovery like TWRP. However, bootloader unlocking will void the warranty of your device. It is always recommended to follow the instructions carefully. Otherwise, you will end up with a bricked device. The Bootloader can also be relocked if it is not needed anymore.
The Realme X2 Pro is the company’s maiden premium flagship smartphone featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset coupled with Adreno 640 GPU. It is available in different storage variants including a 6GB + 64GB, 8GB + 128GB and 12GB + 256GB UFS 3.0 internal storage.
The smartphones feature a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED 90Hz refresh rate display having the resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. Moreover, its display supports 1000 nits maximum brightness level and supports HDR 10+. The device is encased in an aluminium frame and comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect against the frequent falls.
In optics, the Realme X2 Pro comes with a quad-camera module featuring a 64-MP primary camera, an 8-MP ultra-wide lens, a 13-MP telephoto lens, and a 2-MP depth sensor. There’s a 16-MP selfie camera on the front having an f/2.0 aperture for video calling.
The smartphone is backed by a 4000 mAh battery with 65W Super VOOC Flash Charge fast charging technology. There’s an in-display fingerprint sensor along with an accelerometer, proximity, gyroscope, and compass sensor.
You can follow our simple guide below to unlock the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro.
Note: GizmoChina.com is not responsible for any damage to smartphone and data while unlocking the bootloader. The process will void your warranty.
Note: Widevine L3 will replace Widevine L1, and the fingerprint sensor will stop working until the bootloader is locked again.
We hope you have successfully unlocked the bootloader of Realme X2 Pro. If you have any glitch while performing the above tasks, then make sure to comment below.

Xiaomi had an event today in Japan to mark its official entry into the island nation. The Chinese tech giant was supposed to launch in the country next year but decided to make it early. At the event today, Xiaomi announced five products including the Mi Note 10 series, the Mi Smart Band 4, Mi Power Bank 3
The Mi Note 10 series are the only smartphones Xiaomi announced at the event today. The Mi Note 10 (6GB + 128GB) has a price tag of JPY 52,800 (~$489) excluding tax while the Mi Note 10 Pro (8GB + 256GB) will sell for JPY 64,800 (~$597) excluding tax. Both phones will be sold by Amazon Japan. Pre-order starts today for the two devices but the Mi Note 10 will go on sale on December 16 while the Mi Note 10 Pro will go on sale on December 23.
The Mi Note 10 has a 6.47-inch AMOLED FHD+ display with a waterdrop notch and Gorilla Glass 5. It is powered by the Snapdragon 730G processor and packs a 5260mAh battery with support for 30W fast charging that allows you to charge the device from empty to full in just 65 minutes.
The phone has a 32MP selfie camera and a 108MP penta-camera setup on the back. The primary sensor is paired with a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, another 5MP 5x optical zoom camera, a 20MP ultrawide angle camera, and a 2MP macro camera. There is NFC, Bluetooth 5.0, dual SIM support, an audio jack, a USB Type-C port, and an in-display fingerprint scanner.
The Mi Note 10 Pro has nearly the same specs but its 108MP camera has an 8P lens and not a 7P lens like the standard version. It also has more RAM and storage.
The Mi Smart Band 4 is Xiaomi’s latest fitness tracker and it has made its way to Japan. The Mi Smart Band 4 will be sold for JPY 3490 (~$32) excluding tax by Amazon Japan. Pre-orders begin today while sale begins on December 23.
The Mi Power Bank 3 10000mah version brings 18W fast charging support for JPY 1899 (~$18) excluding tax. The power bank will be available in blue and silver and sold by Amazon but there is no mention of when it will be available for purchase.
Mi Power Bank 3 10000mAh Japanese version
The Mi Power 3 10000mAh is different from the one that launched in China early this year. The one sold in Japan has two full-size USB output ports rather than one. Its USB Type-C port is also only an input port, not a 2-way port. The power button is also a circle and no pill-shaped. You still get a MicroUSB port.
Xiaomi says the power bank is also allowed on flights.
Rice is a pretty popular food in Japan, so it is a smart move for Xiaomi to launch its Mi IH Rice Cooker in the market. This is a smart home product, so it works with the Mi Home App.
The rice cooker will sell for JPY 9,999 (~$92) excluding tax. There is no info on availability.
If you are a frequent traveler, then Xiaomi’s Mi Luggage will surely interest you. It will be available in Japan in two versions: a metal version with an aviation-grade aluminum body and a JPY 17,990 price tag and a more affordable JPY 7990 (~$74) version made of Makrolon. These suitcases will also be sold by Amazon.
The metal version comes in silver while the Makrolon version is available in blue, gray, and black. Both are 20-inch suitcases with TSA approved locks and adjustable handles.
Xiaomi also had the Mi MIX Alpha on display at the event but it was in a sealed box and could not be touched. Surprisingly, no Redmi products were announced at the event.

Samsung Vietnam will be holding a launch event on Dec. 12 to announce a new 2020 Galaxy A-series phone. The launch teaser had revealed that the new Galaxy A phone will be arriving with a display that features a punch-hole at the top-center position. This suggested that the company may announce the Galaxy A51 or Galaxy A71 or both phones on Dec. 12 since these devices are rumored to arrive with aforementioned punch-hole styled display. A leaked promo video of the Galaxy A51 smartphone has appeared to confirm on its design, color variants and key specifications
The leaked promo video revels that the Samsung Galaxy A51 that has a “Rhythmic Pattern” rear will be arriving in color editions like Prism Crush Blue, Prism Crush Black, Prism Crush Pink, and Prism Crush White. As it can be seen in the snapshot taken from the video, the phone is fitted with a rectangle-shaped camera module on its back. It is equipped with quad cameras arranged in ‘L’ pattern along with an LED flash.
There is no fingerprint sensor on the backside of the Galaxy A51. It appears that the handset will be arriving with an in-display fingerprint reader like the predecessor Galaxy A50 and Galaxy A50s smartphones.
The Galaxy A51 is fitted with an Infinity-O AMOLED display like the Galaxy Note 10. The size of the screen is 6.5 inches and it carries support for full HD+ resolution. The punch-hole on the display houses a 32-megapixel camera. The quad camera system on its rear has an f/2.0 aperture 48-megapixel primary sensor, an ultrawide 12-megapixel lens, a 5-megapixel depth assist sensor and a 5-megapixel macro lens. There is Super Steady Mode for recording jerk-free videos. The handset is backed by a 4,000mAh battery.
Past reports have revealed that the Exynos 9611 chipset is present under the hood of the Galaxy A51 phone. The SoC is assisted by 4 GB of RAM. The phone may hit the market in storage choices like 64 GB and 128 GB. The handset may come with 15W rapid charging support. The Galaxy A51 will be preinstalled with One UI 2.0 based Android 10 OS. Apart from Vietnam, India is one of the countries to receive the Galaxy A51 phone. There is no word on the pricing of the smartphone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BySean- Dec 9, 2019FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt
According to a new report, the Co-founder and President of Xiaomi Group, Lin Bin, played a role in naming Qualcomm’s new mobile chipset. Earlier today, the senior executive also reposted Lu Weibing’s (CEO and Co-founder) Weibo post on the Redmi K30, which features Snapdragon 765G SoC, that launches tomorrow (10th December 2019).
On the Chinese social media website, the Founder praised Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G which is a 5G processor. He stated that the chipset had an impressive CPU, GPU, and AI performance. Alongside this, the senior executive also revealed that the name of the fifth-generation artificial intelligence engine (AIE) used by Qualcomm came from a private dinner between the Founder and Qualcomm’s Product manages at the CES conference last year.
This is yet another example of the strong partnership between the smartphone manufacturer and the chipmaking giant. Historically, the Chinese company’s smartphones have prominently featured Snapdragon processors of every segment in low, mid to even high-end flagship models. Hence, it is not surprising that the Xiaomi Founder played a part in the naming of Qualcomm’s product.
The Snapdragon 765G is expected to arrive with AI hardware accelerator HTA 220 with a main frequency of up to 700MHz, which is also found in the flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC. Furthermore, it also features 1.4Ghz HVX that means that the AI performance will be double in comparison to the fourth generation AIE with up to 5.5 trillion operations per second being performed.

OPPO will be launching the OPPO Reno 3 series of smartphones later this month. The Chinese manufacturer has already confirmed that the upcoming Reno 3 and Reno 3 Pro are dual-mode 5G-ready phones. The Reno 3 series is now for reservations on the official website in China. Recently, a mysterious OPPO PCRM00 / PCRT00 smartphone was spotted on the database of China’s 3C authority through which it was confirmed that it is an upcoming 5G phone from the company. Today, the phone has appeared on TENNA authority’s database. The listing lacks images of the phone, but it has revealed some of its key specs. The preliminary specs of the PCRM00 / PCRT00 5G phone suggests that it could be the Reno 3 Pro 5G phone.
According to the TENAA listing of PCRM00 / PCRT00 5G, it measures 159.4 x 72.4 x 7.7mm. The device is fitted with a 6.5-inch display and it houses a 3,935mAh minimum rated battery. The 3C listing of the phone reveals that it could be shipped with a charger that supports 30W rapid charger.

Rumors have it that it will be arriving with a 6.5-inch AMOLED display. Hence, it appears that the newly spotted PCRM00 / PCRT00 5G smartphone could be the OPPO Reno 3 Pro 5G.
The Chinese manufacturer has already confirmed that the Snapdragon 765G mobile platform will be powering the Reno 3 Pro 5G. It will be the second phone after the Redmi K30 Pro that debuts tomorrow to feature the SD765G chipset. OPPO has already revealed that the Reno 3 Pro 5G has an AMOLED display with punch-hole placed at its top-left corner. The display seems to be curved towards the edges. Rumors are rife that it carries support for 90Hz refresh rate and 180Hz touch sampling rate. It will arrive with an in-screen fingerprint reader.
It is speculated that the Reno 3 Pro 5G could be coming with 12 GB of RAM. Its rear side could be fitted with an OIS assisted 48-megapixel + 8-megapixel + 13-megapixel + 2-megapixel quad camera setup.

Meizu, the Chinese smartphone brand, has been teasing its new products with puzzles since quite some time. Most of the times, netizens have been able to guess what product or feature the company is teasing.
Today, the company has shared a new teaser image with words “OMA” written over the poster. It also confirms that the launch event for the same will take place in China on 13th December. However, guessing the product getting launched next week is proving to be more difficult this time.
It remains a mystery what the three letters “OMA” means. Given that the poster showcases a crowded place in the background, some are claiming that the device is question should have something to do with active noise cancellation. However, others are suggesting that it could be hinting at One Mind Aicy smart stream, enhancing the capabilities of the company’s own smart voice assistant system.
To know for sure what’s up the company’s sleeves this time, we’ll have to wait for the official launch event to take place in China on 13th December. Since there are still few days left for that, we expect the company to share more details about this in the coming days.

Recently we’ve seen a resurgence in popularity for Windows on ARM. Microsoft themselves made a big deal about by announcing the Microsoft Surface Pro X running on a Qualcomm ARM chipset. Since then, we’ve only seen more ARM-powered Windows devices appear. The only provider for these chipsets was Qualcomm, but Huawei seems to want in now.
Huawei recently introduced the Kunpeng D920S10 desktop motherboard. What this does is allow Huawei’s Kunpeng 920 processor to power PCs, which increases the likelihood of Huawei launching an ARM PC pretty soon. Technically nothing is set in stone, but there’s no way the company isn’t at least slightly interested in an ARM PC with their own chipset.
The Kunpeng 920 chip is a 7nm ARMv8 processor with a top speed of 2.6 GHz that will be available in quad-core or octa-core varieties (although the server versions of the chip can come with up to 64 CPU cores. Huawei’s D920S10 board will support up to 64GB of DDR-2400 RAM (with four slots for memory) and up to six SATA 3.0 hard drives. It also has two M.2 slots for solid state storage, and three PCIe slots.
While Windows 10 on ARM was initially referred to by Qualcomm as “Windows 10 on Snapdragon,” it is now referred to as “Windows 10 on ARM,” which leaves things open for other chipset manufacturers in the future. Whether Huawei’s ARM-PC actually materializes in the future remains to be seen, though we’d definitely like to see it.

According to a new report, MediaTek might be supplying Samsung with 5G chipsets for its low-end range of smartphones in the near future. The former has already formed partnerships with various other brands like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi and may now also supply the South Korean tech giant for its affordable range of smartphones.
MediaTek has just recently launched its Dimensity 1000 which is a high-end 5G SoC. It will be seen in various smartphones from the aforementioned brands in 2020. Alongside this, the company has also announced two mid-range 5G SoC with designated model numbers MT6885 and MT6873 which may soon be found in Samsung’s low-end handsets as well. Notably, MediaTek chipsets are also expected to be featured in Huawei’s affordable lineup of smartphones in 2020.
Reportedly, Samsung is currently in contact with MediaTek for the introduction of mainstream and affordable 5G smartphone chips in the Samsung Galaxy A series and other low-end models. With two of the most popular smartphone brands partnering up with MediaTek, the shipments of the company’s new 5G SoC are expected to reach record-breaking levels.
Furthermore, Samsung has closed its ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) factory in Mainland China and is seeking to outsource low to medium segment devices to others. This provides an opportunity for companies like MediaTek that can receive large sums of orders for Samsung’s affordable range of smartphones.
MediaTek is one of the leading companies for 5G networking in terms of mobile chipsets. Its latest modems also support most of the current global telecommunication operator’s specifications as well. This makes it a key player in the global markets for 5G bandwidths. Additionally, MediaTek is also developing a more advanced millimeter ware (mmWave) frequency band, which will be faster than current 5G solutions and is expected to arrive by 2021.

Earlier today, the Xiaomi Youpin official Weibo announced that it will be launching a new time related product at 10 am on December 11. For the uninitiated, Xiaomi Youpin is the company’s crowdfunding platform, responsible for all the wonderful odd products that get released by them on an almost biweekly basis. Now we’ve got something new coming up.
As we can see from the teaser poster, the new product is probably going to be some sort of clock, possibly an alarm clock. The post mention that the clock supports 16 settings, which they don’t elaborate on. The interesting thing is that Xiaomi already has an alarm clock. It’s one of their most popular products on the crowdfunding platform.
The Xiaomi XiaoAI Smart Alarm Clock, which is possibly one of the most feature-rich alarm clocks in existence, launched in September last year to great reception. It can set 30 separate alarms, use dynamic alarms, broadcast the weather in real time, generate good white noise, setup snooze reminders and even syncs with your phone for reminders.
What we’re getting at here is that the Xiaomi XiaoAI Smart Alarm Clock is an excellent device, so whatever Xiaomi launches will need to improve on it. It’s a high barrier, but it’s also not too hard to imagine an incremental update to the device. We aren’t sure it really warrants a big launch announcement otherwise, so we hope it lives up to the hype.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hello, citizens: West Java introduces app to facilitate communication with residents</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The West Java administration has launched a mobile application that will enable local residents to engage in a two-way communication with administration officials, allowing them to voice concerns over certain issues and curbing the prevalence of fake news.
West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil said he expected the app, dubbed "Sapa Warga", to serve as an official channel through which the administration would be able to catch wind of the latest issues and developments at the neighborhood level, first and foremost.
“We hope the app will allow us to be more in touch with problems cropping up at the neighborhood level. There are tens of thousands of RW [community units] in the province – if everyone is able to be more proactive in articulating their ideas, it will be easier for [the administration] to solve their problems,” Ridwan said during the 2019 West Java Innovation Awards in Bandung, West Java on Friday.
The administration has invested Rp 60 billion (US$4.2 million) in a supply of smartphones that have been loaded with the app, which will later be loaned to at least 53,000 RW heads across the province. The phones are aimed at making it easier for the RW heads to report the latest issues and developments in their respective neighborhoods to the administration.
“This is still the first phase [of the roll-out]. The second phase will see residents download a version of the app that allows them to communicate directly with their respective RW heads,” Ridwan added.
He went on to say the app would prove especially useful whenever the administration wished to spread the latest official news on its development programs. The app is expected to be usable next year, he added.
“It resembles a social media platform, the difference being that users can keep track of their communication history – whether their ideas and recommendations have been considered or approved,” Ridwan said.
The app was also intended to be positioned at the vanguard of the administration’s ongoing fight against fake news, he said. He explained that the app would serve as an instrument used by the administration’s anti-hoax task force to debunk fake news.
“It will help protect residents from false information,” he said.
West Java Communication and Information Agency head Setiaji said the Sapa Warga app would be connected to a number of third-party apps developed by private firms that allow users to pay government taxes, such as e-commerce platforms Bukalapak and Tokopedia.
The app is connected to a 40-terabyte (TB) data center for cloud storage, which would then be expanded to 400 TB to accommodate user influx.
“The first stage of the app development cost us around Rp 300 million to Rp 400 million. We may need up to Rp 3 billion for data storage expansion,” Setiaji said. (rfa)

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Cambridge Analytica profiled voters and what it means for India</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) order holding US based Cambridge Analytica guilty of “deceptive practices to harvest personal information from tens of millions of Facebook users for voter profiling and targeting” has shed new light on the business of psychological profiling aimed at predicting voter behaviour. The Commission’s order spells in great detail the technicalities, business and potential impact of voter profiling on election results.
How did the Cambridge Analytica model work?
The now bankrupt firm’s chief Alexander Nix primarily relied on new research that was done in University of Cambridge that used Facebook profile information to predict an individual’s personality according to the OCEAN scale. The OCEAN scale also known as the five big personality traits measures an individual’s personality on five counts - openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Researchers had developed an algorithm that used an individual’s Facebook likes to predict their personality traits – the more the likes a person had, the more accurate the algorithm’s prediction would be. A researcher at the university named Aleksandr Kogan had developed an application that could collect personal data from not just those Facebook users who had installed this application but also data about their friends who were not using the application. The charge against Facebook in this data collection exercise was that it allowed collection of data from users friends even though they had no information about their data being collected. Among the pieces of critical personal data that was harvested from millions of users in the US and across the world included their name, gender, age, location and likes of all public Facebook pages.
As US investigators put it; this data when analysed by the algorithm could produce a psychological profile of users and predict an individual’s personality better than their friends, family and co-workers. In the US for instance, anyone liking a page related to George Bush, rap, hip-hop and certain other pages could be accurately linked to a conservative and conventional personality. The FTC noted, “Cambridge Analytica was interested in this research because it intended to offer voter-profiling, micro-targeting, and other marketing services to US political campaigns and other US-based clients.” The company also procured voter records in various US states.
Then, a series of paid surveys were carried out in which Facebook users were asked various questions including those pertaining to national security in the US. The algorithm was then trained to analyse these responses along with the harvested Facebook information to classify personalities on a range of issues like “political enthusiasm, political orientation, frequency in voting, consistency in voting for the same political party, and views on particular controversial issues.” It is estimated that data of upto 65 million people; majority of them in the US were harvested in this fashion to build psycho-political profiles. Most of these users had never consented to share their data nor had they consented for their psychological profiling. These profiles were then matched with voter registration records and the trial proved to be a great success. In effect Cambridge Analytica now had a database of Facebook users whose political affiliations and voting behaviour had been predicted using harvested personal data determined by an algorithm. Cambridge Analytica would use this to “identify and build target voter lists and apply psychological profiles to target group of voters.” These profiles could then be sold to political parties or other clients who could then target these users with advertisements and influence their voting behaviour. In effect, these profiles that also revealed consumption tastes and other personal traits could also be sold to corporations who would use it to send targeted advertisemnts for their products. The FTC noted, “The project would have had little value to Cambridge Analytica if the personality scores could not be matched with actual US voters.”
What can it mean for India?
The FTC’s findings and ruling in the Cambridge Analytica case have deep repercussions in a country like India where data privacy is still in its infancy and a large part of the population is unaware about what bits of their personal data are being harvested and for what purposes. The FTC found Cambridge Analytica guilty of deceiving Facebook users – not telling them that their and their friends’ identifiable information was being collected and analysed for political purposes. The Personal Data Protection Bill that was recently cleared by the union cabinet does take many steps in this regard. It explicitly states that the data fiduciary – in this case Facebook – would have to explicitly tell users the kind of personal data it is collecting, the purpose for its collection, source of such collection, the entities with which data will be shared among other things. It provides equal safeguards to users when it comes to processing of their personal data. But the recent FTC judgment in the Cambridge Analytica case shows that users are oblivious of the fine print of the consent that they are often asked to provide. Often the language of these terms and conditions are highly technical and voluminous with users generally preferring to click on the ‘I Accept’ button instead of bothering to read the fine print. In many ways, this was at the crux of the ‘deception’ that Cambridge Analytica was found guilty of. It also remains to be seen if India’s Personal Data Protection Bill can address the issue of comprehensibility and simplicity when it comes to devising terms and conditions for getting citizens consent for collecting, processing and sharing their critical personal data.

    <h5 class="mb-1">10 Amazon Green Monday deals that are better than Black Friday 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon’s Black Friday 2019 sales event was its biggest ever, according to a press release that the nation’s top online retailer sent out last week. That’s pretty impressive considering how big Amazon’s sale was last year, but it’s also not surprising since Black Friday 2019 was actually an eight-day event at Amazon. During that span, we saw some of the best deals we had seen all year on so many products that we expect to be top-sellers this holiday season. That said, today is Green Monday 2019 and while there are always killer deals on Amazon for Green Monday, we were shocked to find so many deals that are better than what we saw during Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Week.
Want to see some highlights? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Forget the Mario Kart bundle because today you can buy a Nintendo Switch console with promo code D3E2CDJ6GB6S and get a $30 credit from Amazon. There are tons of killer Amazon device bundles like the $200 Ring Video Doorbell 2 bundled with a $90 Echo Show 5 for just $139 total and an Echo Dot bundled with a TP-Link smart plug for just $29.99. Other top Amazon deals on Green Monday include the first discount ever on brand new top-of-the-line Bose 700 wireless noise cancelling headphones and other Bose deals, the $200 Roomba 671 robot vacuum that was a Black Friday best-seller for only $194.99, a bunch of terrific Philips Hue deals that were nowhere to be found on Black Friday or on Cyber Monday, great Samsung microSD card deals like a 128GB card for just $16.99, a one-day blowout sale on Anker charging accessories, the wildly popular Philips Norelco OneBlade and OneBlade Pro at better prices than Black Friday, deep discounts on surge protectors to keep your gear from getting fried — and speaking of frying — Dash’s excellent new air fryer ovens at their lowest prices ever.
You can see the entire Green Monday 2019 sale right here on Amazon’s site, or skip the suspense and cut right to the 10 best Green Monday deals down below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It turns out Green Monday 2019 has brought with it some of the best deals we’ve seen in a long time, and this particular sale is one that you should definitely take advantage of. The hot new $100 Dash DMAF360GBBK02 AirCrisp Pro Electric Air Fryer is by far the best air fryer Dash has ever made, which is saying a lot since Dash’s older model is fantastic. Today, for one day only, you can score it in one of three different colors for just $69.99! The only reason to skip this killer deal is if that model doesn’t offer enough capacity for you — in which case you can pick up the $180 DASH DAFT2350GBGT01 Chef Series Air Fry Oven for just $125.99 instead. These deals will disappear at the end of the day on Monday, so definitely get in on the action while you still can.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Philips Norelco’s fantastic OneBlade Pro didn’t get much of a discount on Black Friday, which was a bummer. For those unaware, the Pro model is similar to the original OneBlade everyone loves so much, but way better. It lasts longer, has an LCD screen that shows remaining battery life, comes with an adjustable trimmer, and it has an awesome dock so you can always keep it charged. For Green Monday 2019, Amazon is making up for its lackluster Black Friday deal with an even better discount on this awesome electric shaver. The regular OneBlade is down to $24.96 today and you can get it with 4 stubble trimming combs, 1 body trimming comb, and 1 skin guard for $29.99. But the Pro model is the way to go, and it’s only $59.99 when you clip the coupon on Amazon!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amazon has 8 new device bundle deals that are just as good as Black Friday… or even better</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Monday 2019 were all about device bundles. Sure, individual devices were on sale at deep discounts as well, but the best bargains were all bundles. Those sales are all long gone, but now Green Monday 2019 is here and it turns out that there are bundle deals available on Amazon that are just as good… or even better! For example, bundle the $200 Ring Video Doorbell 2 with a $90 Echo Show 5, and you can get the pair for just $139. That’s insane! You can also upgrade to the $250 Ring Video Doorbell Pro with a $90 Echo Show 5 for only $229. Other fantastic bundle deals on Green Monday include the Echo Dot with a TP-Link smart plug for $29.99, the Echo Dot with two Philips Hue smart LED bulbs for $34.99, the Echo Dot with an Echo Show 8 for just $79.99, and the new unreleased Fire TV Blaster with a Fire TV Stick 4K and an Echo Dot for only $94.97 total.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Walmart’s Green Monday sale is just as big as Black Friday – here are the 10 best deals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Look, we’re going to start this post by being completely honest with you: Walmart’s online Green Monday 2019 sale isn’t the best one you’ll find this year. Don’t get us wrong, there are plenty of killer deals out there and we’re going to show you all the best ones. But Amazon is truly the place to be today if you want the best of the best, with tens of thousands of deals on some of the hottest products of the season. Highlights include the first ever big discount on Bose 700 wireless noise cancelling headphones (they weren’t even discounted on Black Friday or Cyber Monday!), deep discounts on Samsung microSD cards, the best Ring Doorbell bundle deals we’ve ever seen (like a free Echo Sho 5 when you buy a $250 Ring Video Doorbell Pro for $229), discounted Philips Hue LED smart bulbs, a one-day blowout sale on Anker charging accessories, popular Dash air fryers at their lowest prices ever, and more. Oh, and remember the Roomba 671 robot vacuum that dropped to $200 on Amazon and was a Black Friday best-seller? Well, it’s somehow only $194.99 today!
Those deals and so many more are available today on Amazon, and you can check out more in the company’s Green Monday 2019 deals hub. Walmart might not be able to match Amazon this year, but it is offering a handful of deals that are quite impressive. You can see all 2,000 of them right here, and you’ll find our picks for the 10 best Walmart Green Monday deals below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Monday 2019’s big sale on Sony noise cancelling headphones was fantastic, but you still had to pay hundreds for them and not everyone wants to cough up that kind of cash. Thankfully, Amazon’s running a great Green Monday 2019 deal on headphones that do the trick for a fraction of the price. A special limited-time deal just slashes the already-affordable Mpow H5 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones to just $29.99 when you use the coupon code MPOW143AH2 at checkout. These headphones offer impressive sound quality, shockingly deep bass, and 30 hours of battery life that will last the average person a week or even longer!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We knew Amazon was going to have a big showing this year for Green Monday 2019, but we had no idea that the retailer was going to go as nuts as it did. Seriously, some of today’s deals are even better than the ones we found during Amazon’s big Black Friday sale this year! Case in point, Amazon announced in its big press release that the iRobot Roomba 671 Robot Vacuum was one of its best-selling products during Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Monday 2019. It was selling for $200 during that time span, but for Green Monday 2019 it’s on sale at a new all-time low of just $194.99!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s pretty unbelievable how much amazing tech you can get during the weeks leading up to and right after Thanksgiving. Because, let’s be honest, while you’re spending time with your family, you’re also thinking about the fantastic gifts you’re able to get for all of them and yourself with the crazy amount of sales that are going on. But if you weren’t able to get everything you wanted to on Black Friday, Cyber Monday or during Cyber Week, HP wants you to know that they have a whole new set of deals to get you through the holiday season.
During their Green Monday promotion, the deals are targeted specifically to help you save some green. The fantastic options that are offered are helping you finish out your shopping, because you’re going to need some time to wrap those presents once you get them. You’ll be able to get some of your favorite devices and electronics for as much as 63% off during this event! We were shocked by the amount of savings HP is still handing out.
For those in the market for a premium laptop that has super fast processing and amazing graphics, then you’ll want to check out the HP Laptop 14-z. For a limited time only, you’ll be able to get this for only $170, saving you $160! It runs on Windows 10 Home 64 and has a 14″ diagonal HD display. This machine boasts an AMD Dual-Core E2-9000e processor and features unreal clarity with the AMD Radeon™ R2 Graphics. It has 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of eMMC storage, meaning you’ll use this laptop for a long time. A Microsoft© Office software trial is provided and you’ll be able to save $20 instantly if you sign up for a year. You’ll have the choice of setting up a McAfee LiveSafe™ Security Software for up to three years and receive up to nearly $150 in savings. You’ll also be able to customize it in other ways, such as choosing its color between Jet Black, Snow White, Natural Silver, Pale Gold, Smoke Gray, Scarlet Red and Twilight Blue.
But if you’re not looking for laptop and are, instead, searching for a PC, then the HP Slimline Desktop-290-a0035z should be your first stop. Right now, you’ll be saving almost $120 by nabbing this for just $233! This also runs on Windows 10 Home 64, providing you with a friendly and easy-to-use system. It features an AMD Dual-Core A-Series processor and AMD Radeon™ R4 Graphics for some truly impressive viewing potential. You’ll receive 1 TB of HDD storage and 4 GB of memory, as well as a DVD writer, so you can watch the movies you want to watch. There are tons of ports and it supports dual monitors, so this desktop is ready to connect you to anything you need. Its sleek and narrow design isn’t meant to take up your whole desktop, giving you plenty of room for those monitors.
HP offers no cost shipping and easy returns, so it doesn’t hurt you to give something a try. They also offer price matching, meaning if you find one of their devices at a better price somewhere else, you’ll be able to get it from them at that price. You can completely customize either of these computers or many of their other stellar products that you can choose from during this event. But it only lasts until the end of December 9, or until supplies last, so if you’re at all thinking about picking up any of these, you need to do it ASAP. Put a bow on your early shopping for the year with HP.

For example, if you are looking to buy a laptop, you will probably visit numerous websites before ordering one. Collections will help you in comparing laptops available in different websites. If you’re a student, Collections will help you organize your web research and create your lesson plans or reports. If you’re an planning for a trip, Collections will help pull together all your trip or event information in one location.
Based on the feedback from early adopters, Microsoft has made the following improvements to Collections feature:
If you are running Edge browse build 80.0.338.0 or later, you will see this feature enabled.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft today announced that it will shut down Wunderlist on May 6th, 2020. For the past few years, Microsoft has been working on a brand-new task management app called To Do. Microsoft To Do will be the successor to Wunderlist app and you can import your lists from Wunderlist to To Do in few steps. From today, new users will not be able to sign-up for Wunderlist.
Based on the feedback from Wunderlist users, Microsoft has made several changes and additions to To Do app experience. For example, the latest design of To Do app looks and feels similar to Wunderlist. In addition to all the features that were available on Wunderlist, Microsoft To Do app comes with several brand new features such as My Day, Planned Lists, Dark mode, list groups, Planner and Outlook integration and more.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cheaper And More Expensive Land Rover Defenders Are Coming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it goes on sale in the US next spring, the 2020 Land Rover Defender will initially only be available in the 110 guise, which measures 197.6 inches long with the rear-mounted spare wheel, 77.4 inches high, and 82.9 inches wide including the mirrors, with a 119-inch wheelbase.
A smaller Defender 90 variant will join the lineup in the summer of 2020, measuring 180.4 inches long with the rear-mounted spare wheel, 77.5 inches high, and 82.9 inches wide including the mirrors, with a 101.9-inch wheelbase.
The Defender 110 is offered with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine developing 296 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque or a 3.0-liter turbo inline-4 with a 48-volt electric supercharger producing a combined 395 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. The smaller 2020 Defender 90, on the other hand, will be offered with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine with electric boost developing 395 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. According to Autocar, however, the new Defender family will be further expanded with a cheaper entry-level model and a more expensive luxury variant.
Priced at around £25,000 ($32,894), the new entry-level five-door Defender, reportedly codenamed L860, will be cheaper than any previous Land Rover model and is expected to arrive in 2021. The styling is expected to be based on the new Defender while also paying homage to the original iconic Land Rover, but the interior will likely offer less equipment and space to reflect the price.
It's not yet known how the entry-level Defender will be branded, but Autocar claims it could adopt the Land Rover 80 name as a reference to the wheelbase of the original Series 1. The new model could lure buyers away from compact SUVs such as the Jeep Compass, Mini Countryman and Volkswagen Tiguan and compete with premium models like the BMW X1 and Volvo XC40. Reducing development and construction costs will be a challenge to sell the L860 at a low showroom price.
More powerful four-cylinder engines and all-wheel drive are allegedly possible, but there's a risk that this could cannibalize sales of the Land Rover Discovery Sport. A plug-in three-cylinder version is also a possibility to keep emissions low. To keep costs down, it's believed the L860 will be built at Land Rover's new plant in Slovakia, which has lower employee costs. Autocar claims the new entry-level model will be unveiled in the third quarter of 2021, so we should see some test mules undergoing testing in 2020.
According to insiders, the range-topping Defender Sport is in the early stages of development and is expected to be the first pure-electric Defender based on the new MLA architecture. It will be significantly more luxurious than any other current Defender to rival the Aston Martin DBX and entry-level versions of the Bentley Bentayga but isn't expected to launch until around 2023.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus TV gets Netflix app and a redesigned remote controller</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an effort to diversify its product portfolio, OnePlus launched its first-ever smart television, OnePlus Q1 Pro TV a few months back. While OnePlus TV was praised for its vibrant 4K LED panel, integrated soundbar, the lack of Netflix app and the remote control were some of the biggest letdowns of the smart TV.
The good news is the lack of a Netflix app and a bad remote controller will no longer force consumers to look somewhere else because these issues are now solved. The Netflix app is now available for OnePlus TV users, so you can now easily consume Netflix content, of course, for that you’ll have to have a Netflix subscription.
OnePlus is also offering a redesigned remote controller as a replacement to the previous controller for the OnePlus TV owners. Those who are planning to buy OnePlus Q1 Pro in the coming days will get the redesigned TV remote out of the box.
The new remote controller is made out of plastic, as opposed to the previous remote, which was made out of aluminum. You also have new shortcut buttons for Netflix and YouTube, the volume keys are on the front, which means they are now more accessible.
Are you a OnePlus TV owner? Let us know your thoughts on the redesigned remote controller.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Minecraft PS4 cross-play is finally real as Sony joins Bedrock Edition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sony PlayStation are finally joining in on Microsoft’s cross-platform version of Minecraft. That’s right, Minecraft PS4 cross-play is no longer a dream!
Starting tomorrow, installed versions of Minecraft on PlayStation 4 systems will update to the unified Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Connecting players across Xbox One, Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android mobile devices, Gear VR and now PS4, Minecraft is a connected world everywhere.
PlayStation 4 players will now be able to access the Minecraft Marketplace, a unified storefront for skins and texture packs that transcends platform restrictions. If you buy a skin pack on Xbox One, you’ll own it on every platform.
Minecraft: Bedrock Edition was first teased for PlayStation 4 a few days ago. With images of physical copies of the unified title leaking on social media, complete with Playstation-capable Minecraft Token currency, it was inevitable that Bedrock Edition would come to PS4.
Explore randomly generated worlds and build amazing things from the simplest of homes to the grandest of castles. Play in creative mode with unlimited resources or mine deep into the world in survival mode, crafting weapons and armor to fend off the dangerous mobs.
The video game phenomenon is bigger than ever before, but this cross-play update is a huge stepping stone in general. With the introduction of Minecraft PS4 cross-play, Microsoft’s Xbox Live ecosystem is now in place on PlayStation 4.
For parents, this news is amazing. Just think, for Christmas, it doesn’t matter what system you buy your kids, they can still play Minecraft with friends. What a world we live in.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Snapchat is testing a new feature that will allow users to edit their faces into GIFs. Called Cameo, the feature is rolling out to a limited number of users at the moment.
In an interview with TechCrunch, Snapchat confirmed that the feature is currently rolling out to a limited number of users for beta testing. The feature is not limited to the US and is being tested in various international markets like France. The feature takes advantage of the deepfake technology that has come under fire for misuse. The good thing is that Snapchat’s Cameo feature is pretty harmless.
This feature will also allow Snapchat to separate itself from Facebook’s social media services which seamlessly copied the stories feature from Snapchat. The company hasn’t disclosed the ETA at the moment but has promised a global launch soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chevrolet Camaro Discounts Are Even Better This Month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite being a fantastic muscle car, the Chevrolet Camaro still lags behind its chief rival, the Ford Mustang, in sales. While the Mustang is available overseas in right-hand-drive configuration, the Camaro is not. Even on the domestic front, the Mustang outpaces Camaro sales. Last year, for example, a total of 75,842 Mustangs were sold in the US, compared to 50,963 Camaros. Expect a similar result for 2019. Instead of accepting defeat outright, Chevrolet continues to stay in the fight by offering attractive Camaro sales incentives.
Last month, Chevy was selling the V8-powered Camaro SS Coupe at 12 percent below MSRP. And last summer the Bow Tie brand had an even more interesting offer: a $2,500 discount on 2019 Camaros for current Mustang owners and lessees. Could they coax some Mustang drivers to switch sides?
Whatever ultimately happened, Chevy has decided to bring back this offer, only better. As part of the brand's December sales program, not only is it offering Chevy employee pricing but also another $2,500 total cash allowance for a grand total of $5,495 off MSRP for a 2019 Camaro SS.
But again, the main stipulation is that buyers must be current Mustang owners or lessees. It's an interesting offer, no doubt, but if you're only seeking to get the best V8 power bang for your buck without any brand loyalty, then it probably doesn't get any better than this. The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro SS has an MSRP of $37,000. Do the quick math and this discount drops the price to a darn reasonable $31,505.
That gets you a 45- hp 6.2-liter V8, rear-wheel-drive muscle car. To further compare, the Ford Mustang GT has a 5.0-liter V8 with 460 hp and an MSRP of $35,630, though that's without any incentives. As of this writing, Ford does not appear to be offering any Mustang discounts this month, but it's always best to check at dealerships because some offers are unadvertised.

The Indie World – 10.12.19 livestream will, like always, be livestreamed on the official Nintendo Switch YouTube channel.
While not a full Nintendo Direct with AAA announcements, the smaller Indie World presentations are lovely additions by Nintendo. Highlighting some of the Nintendo Switch’s most innovative and inventive video games, the Indie World directs are great companion streams for Nintendo Switch gamers.
“Tune in on December 10th for a new Indie World showcase livestreaming featuring roughly 20 minutes of information on some upcoming indie games for Nintendo Switch,” reads the description.
As the last Nintendo Direct of 2019, Nintendo is certainly making sure that Switch owners know exactly where to spend their Christmas money.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch Elon Musk Jump A Red Light In Tesla Cybertruck</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Tesla Cybertruck is not expected to enter production until 2021, which is why residents of Los Angeles were in for a big surprise when the electric truck was spotted driving around local roads. Those who were able to get close to the truck got an even bigger shock when they noticed who was driving - Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Some people may be wondering how Tesla was already able to get the Cybertruck out on the road but keen-eyed observers noticed the truck was spotted wearing a manufacturer plate, meaning the company is allowed to drive it on the road even if it isn't production-ready.
Speaking of production-ready, it looks like Tesla has already made a few tweaks to the design, including the one-piece headlight design, which now features two brighter headlights that stand out over the connected light stript between them. The taillights too having seemingly been changed since the Cybertruck debuted on stage and now appear to be more segmented into three distinct pieces.

Musk was spotted departing Japanese restaurant Nobu in the Cybertruck followed by a Tesla Model S (likely filled with engineers). We don't know what platform underpins the truck Musk was seen in, but since it is so far from production, we assume it is a Model X drivetrain underneath. Driving the Cybertruck around LA is likely a publicity stunt for Tesla, but just like the unbreakable window test, this latest stunt didn't go without a hilarious gaffe.
When leaving the restaurant, Musk smacks down a road sign, which should have been easily avoidable, before jumping a red light and swerving into traffic. Potential buyers are already concerned that the CyberTruck may be too large to fit in their garage. They should be equally concerned by the amount of body roll the truck demonstrates as it sprints to beat the oncoming traffic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung is expected to launch four new Galaxy smartphones, which are Galaxy Note 10 Lite, Galaxy S10 Lite, Galaxy A71, and Galaxy A51, on Thursday this week. While the Galaxy Note 10 Lite and the S10 Lite are going to be more like a flagship smartphone, the Galaxy A71, and Galaxy A51 are going to be what you call “budget-friendly smartphones,” according to a Slovakian shop, where the prices of the Samsung’s December releases leaked.
The price leak in the Slovakian shop suggests that the Galaxy S10 Lite is going to be the most expensive phone, which will be followed by Note 10 Lite. The Galaxy A51 will be the most affordable smartphone, while the A71 will cost a bit more than the A51. You can see the price tag of the upcoming Galaxy smartphones.
All these three smartphones will be launched on December 12 and are expected to go on sale from December 27. You can read more about the Galaxy S10 Lite, Note 10 Lite, Galaxy A71 by clicking on the links. If you’re interested in the Galaxy A51 you can watch the below video.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beijing orders Chinese government to dump all Windows PCs by 2022</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chinese Communist Party Central Office has ordered all government services to replace all computers running non-Chinese software and operating systems within the next 3 years, reports AFR.
The move to force China to replace Windows PCs comes in response to increasing pressure by USA on Chinese technology companies like Huawei which restricted their access to Western software, operating systems and markets, and pressure by the US government on US and European networking companies not to use Chinese technology, such as Huawei’s 5G base stations.
The Chinese government services have been ordered to replace 30 per cent of their devices in 2020, 50 per cent in 2021, and 20 per cent in 2022. Analysts company China Securities, estimate around 20 million to 30 million pieces of hardware will need to be replaced to ensure only “secure and controllable” technology is used as directed by China’s 2017 Cyber Security Law.
For now private Chinese companies, which form the bulk of Microsoft’s Chinese revenue, are not affected, but this could easily change.
When China replace Windows PCs the switchover to homegrown Chinese operating systems such as Kylin OS is not expected to be easy, but given the leverage using US technology to run the Chinese government hands to the US government, on this occasion the directive appears serious.
China has previously touted Linux as a replacement, and Microsoft even offered “Chinese Government Edition” of Windows 10 in 2017, but this will no longer be considered sufficient.  Unlike previous pushes for self-sufficiency, recent US sanctions have added urgency to the project, said analyst Paul Triolo of consultancy Eurasia Group.
The tit for tat between USA and China risks splintering the technology world and significantly reducing the economies of scale which has kept electronics cheap these last few decades.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mysterious Hackers Strike BMW And Hyundai</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cybersecurity is more important than ever not only for governments but also for global corporations, including automakers. The near-endless amount of information potentially available within any company's internal database is simply too tempting to ignore for hackers. Instead of genuinely trying to compete with better products, it's easier and far less costly to hack into those systems and steal as much as possible. BMW and Hyundai are just two automakers who recently fell victim to this method.
According to Silicon Angle, hackers made their first strike attempts against both automakers last spring. The APT32 group, also known as "Ocean Lotus," has been wreaking havoc since at least 2014, targeting not only corporations but also foreign governments, dissidents, and journalists. Specifically, its focus has been on Southeast Asian countries.
Sources claim the group has ties to the Vietnamese government. Authorities believe APT32 was behind a previous hacking attempt on the global network of Toyota. This resulted in 3.1 million customer records being stolen. But why are Vietnamese hackers so interested in automakers in particular? What's in it for them? Vietnam is becoming a fast-growing manufacturer of vehicles, and recently established its own brand, VinFast. Several global automakers also have production plants in Vietnam.
It didn't take long for BMW to detect the network hack but instead of stopping it they allowed the hackers to continue but still denied them access to confidential information. The idea was to track their every move. They cut them off entirely at the end of November. The hackers were seeking intellectual property data, such as BMW's expansion into electric vehicles that will include the upcoming i4, iX3, and production-spec iNext.
Interestingly, BMW and VinFast have a design partnership. This begs the question: if they're partners, what's the purpose of the hack? Basically, analysts believe Vietnam is directly copying China's corporate espionage hacking policies, even if it means breaking into the networks of supposed partners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Upgraded Chuwi UBook goes for Surface Go’s throat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chinese hardware manufacturers CHUWI have surprisungly upgraded their Chuwi UBook 2-in-1 to create a more cost-effective Surface Go alternative.
Originally unveiled through the company’s Kickstarter for the 2-in-1 system, which raised an impressive $450,000, the UBook has always been pitched as a competitor to Microsoft’s Surface Go.
With a smart change in components, Chuwi is aiming to make their offerings more efficient and cheaper than Microsoft.
Firstly, this comes with a change of CPU. While the original UBook launched earlier this year with an Intel 6Y30, Chuwi is upgrading to the Intel N4100. The new processor features a quad-core die with four threads; the highest frequency reaches up to 2.4 GHz.
Alongside a bost in performance, upgrading to the Intel N4100 has a different benefit: lower power consumption. Chuwi has used this gap in power draw to swap out the GPU from the Intel UHD 515 to Intel UHD 600, which can decode 4K video easily.
Storage has also been improved. While the original model sported eMMC memory, Chuwi has instead decided to include the storage combination of 8GB LPDDR4+256GB SSD to make UBook more efficient in dealing with multiple tasks.
Chuwi is banking on this improvement to storage in its competition to beat the Surface Go.
“At a similar price, compared with UBook 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space, Surface Go has only 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space, which is poorer not only in the speed of reading and writing but also in the storage,” reads the press release.
In what is another strong move for the Chuwi UBook, the manufacturer has improved the number of IO on their device. For interfacing, users can use the interface of versatile USB Type-C, USB 3.0, headphone jack, DC charging, Micro HDMI and Micro SD.
As Chuwi is keen to tell us, “Surface Go only has USB-C, headphone jack and Micro SD to interface with. With only one USB-C interface, it is unable to charge while doing other operations. Instead, the user has to buy Surface Dock which is specially designed for Surface Connect interface.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Popular text/code editor Notepad++ is making its way back to the Microsoft Store. Back in the spring of 2018, an unofficial port of Notepad++ showed up on the Microsoft Store but it was later taken down.
Now the app has made its way back to the Microsoft Store and is updated to version 7.8.1  which is just a version down from the official app (v7.8.2). Notepad++ is an amazing app for people who want more than just a note-taking app. The app supports many programming languages and is light-weight making it the first choice for developers around the world.
You can download the unofficial port from the Microsoft Store. Alternatively, you can also get the x86 and x64 package from the official website if you’re not comfortable using an unofficial port.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meet The McLaren 620R: The Most Powerful Sports Series Yet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you thought the McLaren 600LT was the most hardcore Sports Series model, wait until you see the new McLaren 620R. Based on the track-only 570S GT4, the McLaren 620R is essentially a GT4 race car for the road, offering motorsport credentials in a road-legal package. McLaren describes the 620R as the "most track-focused, track-ready but roadgoing McLaren Sports Series model." It was built to celebrate the success of the 570S GT4 customer race car, which is the most successful GT car built by McLaren with more race wins and podiums than any other to date since debuting in 2017.
The McLaren 620R looks like a race car, handles like a race car, performs like a race car and feels like a race car, resulting in a seamless transition from race to road and vice versa. It shares the same lightweight single-piece carbon fiber Monocell II chassis as the 570S GT4, with a targeted dry weight of 2,826 pounds. Adjustable aerodynamic elements, race-derived suspension components, and powertrain recalibration to increase power and performance further enhance the 620R's dynamics.
Powering the 620R is the same 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the GT4 car, but with significantly more power. Since the car isn't restricted by racing regulations, the engine ECU and turbocharger management have been reconfigured to produce 610 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque, making the 620R the most powerful Sports Series car yet. This enables the 620R to hit 0-62 mph in 2.9 seconds and 0-124 mph in 8.1 seconds before maxing out at 200 mph.
Power is sent through a seven-speed Seamless Shift Gearbox with super-fast shift times ideal for setting blistering lap times. For added drama on the road, selecting Sport mode allows the driver to hear the upshift 'crack' created by a split-second cut of the ignition spark during a gearshift.
Other motorsport components derived from the 570S GT4 include two-way manually adjustable coilover dampers, which feature 32 clicks of adjustment per corner to allow a driver to tailor compression and rebound rates to suit their driving style and track conditions and is 13.2 pounds lighter than the regular Sports Series units. The suspension also features lightweight aluminum wishbones and uprights and stiffer anti-roll bars and springs than those fitted on a regular Sports Series model.
The rubber top mounts have been replaced with solid stainless-steel alternatives resulting in "noticeable improvements" in steering control and feedback. An adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing raised 12.5 inches into the cleaner airflow above the vehicle increases downforce while minimizing drag, which is now road legal thanks to an incorporated third brake light.
The front bumper, splitter, and hood have been redesigned, with the splitter retaining the 570S GT4's aero blades and cut-outs, while the carbon fiber hood has twin nostrils to aid downforce and clean up the airflow over the top of the car. Front dive planes contribute up to 66 pounds of downforce as part of the 143 pounds delivered by the full-frontal aero package.
Stopping power is provided by a lightweight braking system with carbon-ceramic discs (15.3-inch front and 14.9-inch rear) and forged aluminum brake calipers. As standard, the 620R rides on Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tires, but these can be swapped with optional, full-slick motorsport tires for track driving.
Specially developed for McLaren by Pirelli's Motorsport team, the slick tires are optimized to complement the motorsport brakes and race-derived suspension of the 620R. They unlock a contact patch eight percent larger than the road tire, increasing lateral G-forces and enabling quicker lap times. This is the first time that a road-legal car with 19-inch front wheels and 20-inch rear wheels has been engineered to be able to run on slick tires without the need for additional mechanical adjustment.
Being based on a GT4 race car, the interior has been stripped out and lacks luxuries such as a floor carpet and glovebox. Air-conditioning, IRIS Navigation, and an audio system are not included as standard but can be added at no extra cost. An upgraded Bowers & Wilkins upgraded audio system is available as an optional extra. The driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fiber racing seats with six-point racing harnesses, fitted as standard. A McLaren Track Telemetry system comes as standard and is displayed on a center-mounted seven-inch touchscreen.
Three colors are available inspired by the 570S: McLaren Orange (with white racing stripes), Silica White (orange stripes) and Onyx Black (orange stripes). Each can be optioned with race number decals and/or partner decals. Additional body colors are available from MSO.
The McLaren 620R will be limited to just 350 units. Production will begin in January, with each car starting at $328,951 including taxes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Magic Leap One developer slams the product – “An absolute nightmare.”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We have recently heard that Magic Leap has only managed to sell 6000 units of their Magic Leak One headset, despite it being $1000 cheaper than Microsoft’s HoloLens. The device has nearly equivalent specs to the HoloLens 2 and backing by major companies such as Google. It appears however that the company has been overpromising and under-delivering, writes a Magic Leap developer.
The Magic Leap developer (not an employee of the company) creating content for the headset reports that it is simply not very good. In a thread on Reddit discussing the poor sales of the headset Nostalgicbear writes:
In contrast in the same thread another developer notes:
… while a 3rd continues:
The Magic Leap One is, of course, a 1st generation product, but the company managed to raise more than $2.3 billion from investors such as Google, Alibaba and AT&T, but much of their hype appears to have been based on reportedly faked demos and large promises.
With the birds now coming home to roost, the Information reports dozens of staff have been laid off and two executives, CFO Scott Henry and SVP of creative strategy John Gaeta, have departed the company and that the Magic Leap’s next headset may be years off, as the company has run into “fundamental technology constraints” as they try and expand the field of view while at the same time squeezing in 5G and multiple colour options in a smaller and lighter headset.
In a statement, Magic Leap did not deny the report of disappointing Magic Leap sales numbers, but stated it was “littered with inaccuracies and misleading statements.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World famous brick merchant Nokia is briefly pivoting away from mobiles to launch its first ever Smart TV, and has graciously given Indian retailer Flipkart the rights to use its brand on a new intelligent gogglebox simply dubbed the Nokia Smart TV ($589). The 55in television features a 4K LED display with a wide colour gamut and intelligent dimming for "life-like picture quality," and also boasts a TruSurround Sound and Dolby Audio speaker system provided by the folks over at JBL. The (almost) bezel-less screen is powered by a quad-core processor and runs on Android 9.0 with built-in Chromecast, meaning it should be every bit as smart as the name suggests. Unfortunately, the Nokia Smart TV is only due to launch in India at the moment, so keep your fingers crossed for a proper international launch in the future.

If you're struggling with an iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro that whose GPS just won't work reliably, you aren't alone. In fact, over on Reddit you'll find a few people reporting problems using Waze, Strava, and more.
One Strava user has been working with the developer of the app to try and get to the bottom of things. And so far, they're blaming Apple.
Other users have chimed in to say that they've also been having problems with GPS-enabled apps, including the popular Waze mapping app.

But wait, theres more.
And on it goes. These reports appear to be sporadic although they are all related to the 2019 iPhones. Whether that means this is a software or hardware issue, it's difficult to tell. It's also possible that the issue isn't as big as it might appear – people with perfectly working iPhones don't post to Reddit to say so, after all.

Apple's Siri Remote has always been a bone of contention for Apple TV users. And with Swiss fiber TV company Salt giving Apple TV 4K boxes to its subscribers it was only a matter of time before they complained. And when they did, Salt made an alternative.
The new remote looks more like a "proper" remote than anything Apple has made and while it was reportedly designed in collaboration with Apple, it's clear this is something it wouldn't want to ship itself.
Because that collaboration was in place the remote works just like the Siri Remote does. There are no steps needed in order to pair the thing and it looks much easier to use without accidentally rewinding whatever you're watching, too.

Hopefully this is good news for everyone, though. It seems Apple is aware that the Siri Remote design is sub-optimal. And given its newfound fondness of listening to users and acting on their feedback we can reasonably hope – if not expect – that the next Apple TV will rectify things.
Maybe?

Apple's new Mac Pro is just hours away from being ready for pre-order, and now the machine has also gone through FCC approval after it appeared on the online registry as spotted by 9to5Mac.
That means that the Mac Pro can now be sold in the United States which is pretty important if you want to put it up for pre-order. We still don't really know when this thing will go on sale, though. Nor what built-to-order Mac Pros will look like in the old price department. But given the vast majority of Mac Pro buyers will be businesses or people who can write the cost off, that's likely not all that important to them.

This is the first Mac Pro refresh we've seen since 2013 and it's a big one. This is nothing like the trash can design that failed so badly thanks to poor thermals. It's big, boxy, and looks like a Mac Pro should. And it has the innards to match, too.
Unfortunately, it has a price to go with it. Starting at $5999 this isn't going to be a cheap computer. But if you need the best Mac available, and want to be able to expand it, this is it.

If Apple hoped that its ongoing Crimean problem would just go away, it's becoming clear that isn't going to happen. In the latest turn of events 15 European Parliament members (MEPs) have written to Apple, asking it to reconsider its options.
Apple recently made a change that means Crimea appears as Russian in the Apple Maps and Weather apps. But that's only the case if you're in Russia. But even that is causing controversy, with Patently Apple (via 9to5Mac) noting that 15 MEPs want Apple to alter course.

Tochisky has also took to Twitter to tell Apple that it needs to value international law above profits.
In the letter sent to Apple, MEPs call for the company to "restore correct mentioning of Crimea" to make it appear as part of Ukraine regardless of where the user is located.
This is clearly an issue that isn't going to go away, no matter how much Apple likely wishes that it would.

The Golden Globes are always a big deal in Hollywood and this year is Apple's big chance to announce the arrival of Apple TV+ with a bang. And "The Morning Show" might just be about to do that after it picked up multiple nominations across a couple of categories.
The biggest of those is as the best TV series drama that could see the show become a household name. Both of the show's biggest stars, Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon, are also both up for best actress nominations.
The Golden Globes ceremony will be held on January 5 2020 so we – and Apple – don't have to wait too long to find out whether there's a win here or not. Given the competition is made up of Big Little Lies, The Crown, Killing Eve and Succession, that's not going to be easy to attain.

This follows the news that Billy Crudup has also been nominated for a Critics Choice award.
It's been something of a topsy turvy couple of months for "The Morning Show" following the launch of Apple TV+. Initially it was panned by critics but some of them have started to change their tune. Importantly, viewers seem to have been more kind to the show although it's debatable whether it's hit the highs we might have expected given the cast and the promotion Apple gave it prior to the Apple TV switch-on.

good riddance It's time to say goodbye to the 2013 Mac Pro After six years it's finally time to say goodbye to the 2016 Mac Pro. And who better to do that than someone who perhaps has more obsolete Macs than anyone?

Watches, be they smart or not, are a utilitarian fashion accessory, but that doesn't mean they have to be dull. There is an entire industry built around providing accessories to smartwatches like the Fitbit Versa 2. We've combed through the interwebs to showcase some of our favorite Versa 2 accessories here for you below.
Staff Pick
These wireless earbuds are just about as good as they come for such a low price. Talk with your virtual assistant or stream music from your Versa 2 on your next jog or commute.
$110 at Amazon
This top-rated screen protector comes six to a package and promises an innovative anti-bubble application. IQ Shield calls their product a "smart film" that once applied blends in seamlessly to the screen.
$10 at Amazon
This charging stand from EZCO is nice because it gets your Versa 2 up and off the counter without calling too much attention to itself in the process. It has a strong magnet to keep your watch in the cradle, and rubber feet so that the puck doesn't slide off the table easily. Its charging cable is nearly four feet long, so you don't have to worry that it won't reach your outlet from the nightstand.
$13 at Amazon
I'm a big proponent of the idea of why get one when you can get two. After all, if you lose your original cable and only have one backup, then you no longer have a backup (two is one and one is none). Fortunately, you can pick up this 2-pack of Versa 2 chargers from Mostof for cheap, so you'll be covered wherever you are!
$9 at Amazon
We like this case because it is compact yet crush-resistant. It also has a couple of dedicated spaces to strap in your Versa 2, and another webbed compartment for your Fitbit charger or other accessories. It does a great job of fulfilling its purpose: protecting your watch on the go.
$25 at Amazon
These first-party Fitbit bands live up to their higher price with a very comfortable elastomer material that is perforated to allow for greater airflow and cooling. You can choose from five attractive colors, including navy, black, glacier, white, and our favorite, coral.
$30 at Fitbit
The same quality leather materials from Horween, with a bit of Fitbit functionality, added to the mix. This band comes in classic charcoal or a modern moss suede variety for a unique leather look. The perforations allow your wrist to breathe easier, keeping you as cool as you look.
$50 at Fitbit
One of the best parts of getting a new piece of technology is in making that tech your own through accessorizing. Out of all of the Fitbit Versa 2 accessories I've seen, the best pairing for this smartwatch are these awesome wireless earbuds from Soundcore. They have great audio for such a low price and they allow you to play music from your watch via Spotify, Deezer, Pandora, or your own downloads over Bluetooth.
Save 40% and get three months of wireless service for just $45
As you might expect, many of the best Fitbit Versa 2 accessories are bands to change the color and style of the watch. While there are many great third-party watch bands, I've always found that those from Fitbit itself are the best for me. The sport band with its perforations is great to keep you cool while active, and this Horween leather band brings a classic style into the modern era.
Whichever items you decide on, we're sure you have fun accessorizing your Fitbit Versa 2.

⌚🛡️ Keep that Versa 2 looking pristine with these great screen protectors The Fitbit Versa 2 is made with Gorilla Glass 3 for solid durability, but there are some activities that might push your smartwatch to the brink. For those occasions or for the more clumsy among us, there are these great screen protectors.
⚡⌚ Don't be caught without a charger for your Versa 2! Even though the Fitbit Versa 2 has incredible battery life for a smartwatch, it doesn't hurt to be prepared for when the charge gets low. Check out these charging cables and pick a couple up for yourself so you aren't left powerless in a pinch.
Fitbit Versa 2 in charge Keep that Fitbit Versa 2 powered up with a charging stand The Fitbit Versa 2 offers up to a full week of power on a single charge, but you will still have to recharge it at some point. Whether you want a bedside stand or extra charging cradles, we've picked the best options out there!

Apple TV+ has only been around for two months but it's already received its first award nomination. But it isn't a huge one. Unless you're actor Billy Crudrup, of course. He's up for an award as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Cory Ellison in "The Morning Show."
The show itslef has been on the receiving end of mixed reviews since it debuted, although many have found that the early reviews by critics were just a little on the harsh side. And while Apple TV+ nor the show itself are up for an award, any nomination by The Critics Choice Association is good news, even if only for exposure

As for Crudrup, he spoke with GQ (via 9to5Mac) and explained that playing the role required quite a bit of work.
Now that the first nomination has rolled in, Apple will surely be hoping that more will follow.

The Apple TV actions are some of my favorite new additions in iOS 13. They make using my Apple TV easier, and I no longer need to find hacked-together solutions just to turn it off and on. Now there are shortcut actions to wake up and put my Apple TV to sleep, play and pause, open a specific app, and more.
I've created shortcuts and automations around a number of these actions to add a little fluidity to my day, especially to the beginning and end of my work day. I've also built shortcuts that make switching between apps easier. Here are some of my favorite shortcuts and automations to use with my Apple TV.

I create shortcuts like this because I like using them with Siri and my HomePods.
Another simple one, this one is for waking up your Apple TV and is great if that's all you want to do. So I can just say "Hey Siri, Apple TV on," and the Apple TV in my office turns on. This shortcut also opens the TV app on the Apple TV automatically, as I've had trouble getting that to happen on its own in the past.
Source: iMore
This one puts my Apple TV to sleep. And unlike the my 'Apple TV On,' which I have because I like controlling things with my voice, this shortcut is flat-out more convenient than using the Siri Remote. Whereas with the remote you need to press and hold the TV button to activate Control Center, then click Sleep, this shortcut is a simple voice command or button press, then off goes the Apple TV.

What this automation does is shut off my Aurora LED panel in my room, which I use as one of my primary light sources, as well as turn on a lamp in my office. At the same time, this automation also turns on the Apple TV in my office and, for good measure, opens the TV app on the Apple TV. Uses an NFC disc I have attached to the desk in my room.
This automation works with both Apple TV and a couple of HomeKit accessories. I work from home, which means that all of the accessories that I need to work with are on the same network, so I don't need to manage multiple locations.

This one is essentially the opposite of 'Morning routine.' It shuts off the light in my office and puts the Apple TV to sleep. It then turns on the Aurora panel in my room. Like 'Morning routine,' this automation is attached to an NFC disc, this time on the desk in my office.
Source: iMore
This one could actually be called "Watch whatever." While this shortcut has Netflix in it, you can change it to any app that's present on your Apple TV. To do that, just tap the blue text that says Netflix, then select the app you want to use. Do the same thing to change My Office to your Apple TV. You should also rename this shortcut so you can use the right name with Siri.
I've actually got a few versions of this shortcut with tweaked names and different apps just so I can open various apps on my Apple TV hands-free. I like to use these shortcuts with my HomePod, which is in my office and can listen for shortcut commands, even if it kicks the actual processing back to my iPhone.

Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently in Japan meeting developers and members of Apple Store teams. He's also been sharing the highlights of his visit on Twitter, complete with well-staged photos.
Cook has been known to travel the world as part of his role as the head of one of the planet's biggest companies and he recently visited the likes of France and Germany.
During this trip in particular Cook met developers at Apple Omotesando, while also sharing a great photo of Tokyo that was, obviously, #shotoniPhone.

Cook also took the oportunity to meet with people working in the healthcare field during a visit to Keio University School of Medicine.
Cook's visit happened to coincide with Computer Science Education Week, with students learning about coding at Apple Marunouchi.
You can see more photos of Cook's trip on his official Twitter account.

In the tech world we're all guilty of chasing the latest, hottest, flashiest, and fastest thing. This year that's iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. But that's unfair to iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. Until 2019, they were the best iPhones ever made. And photographer John Kraus has reminded us (via 512Pixels) just how good their cameras are, too.
Kraus took his iPhone XS Max and placed it near the launch site of SpaceX's CRS-19 rocket. The result is a shot that looks highly impressive and reminds us once again that perhaps we don't really need the latest iPhone in order to take some amazing shots.

Now admittedly this isn't going to make me trade my iPhone 11 Pro in for a used iPhone XS. But if you're still on the fence about upgrading, this might make you think twice. Especially if you've been happy with your iPhone XS and its photography prowess to this point.

Apple's 2020 iPhones – or at least some of them – might be able to pack larger batteries if a new report is accurate. That report has Apple opting to use a smaller battery protection circuit, allowing for larger batteries to be used.
That report comes from The Elec (via MacRumors) and has Apple using new battery protection circuits from provider ITM Semiconductor. The company already makes the same modules for Samasung which uses it in its Galaxy S11, so it's already tried and tested.
The battery protection circuit helps the power source manage charging and discharging to ensure it does so at safe rates. ITM Semidoncuctor apparently pairs the circuit with a MOSFET anad PCB, reducing the space required for the whole package.

If all goes according to plan this new part will be used in at least some of Apple's 2020 iPhones. Quite how many the company will release is currently the subject of great discussion, with as many as five phones potentially in the cards. If that's the case we may finally see the end of the iPhone SE rumors, with a new phone pencilled in for the first quarter of 2020.

This post is something I've been thinking about on and off for a few weeks now. But seeing Joe Maring pose the question of whether 64GB is enough for a phone in 2019, I figured I wasn't the only one thinking along these lines. So here we are.
In that post, Joe shares the thoughts of some of the Android Central forum family, and to my surprise, the consensus was that 64GB is, generally at least, plenty. Maybe the only people who complain about 64GB starting points from Apple and Google are those who tend to complain at anything and everything. And, of course, those who think specs are more important than user experience. "Moar storage, more processors, moar everything" I hear them cry. But who really needs more than 64GB of storage in an iPhone?

I've never bought an iPhone with more than 64GB of storage. I've always tended to buy the one with the lowest storage available, too. It just isn't something I struggle with. Which is odd, because you'd imagine if anyone was going to need globs of space it would be someone who writes about phones and apps for a living. But here I am with my 64GB iPhone 11 Pro with 20GB free. If anyone's wondering, I have a 64GB iPad Pro with 20GB free, too.

My iPhone storage currently looks like this. I have all of my years of photos and videos on there, plus a healthy collection of games and of course more apps than most. Yet I'm fine. How?
Two main reasons:
These two things mean that I just don't run out of space. Sure, if Apple's 2020 flagship iPhone starts at 128GB that's what I'll get. And sure, it'll probably be almost full because iOS is handling the housekeeping for me. But if 64GB is an option you can be sure that's what I'll buy.
Now, I'm sure there will be people who need more storage. There are always edge cases. Always people who want to download TV shows and movies for offline playback. There will always be people who want to have more than 64GB of music available even when outside of cell signal. And there will even be some who just want to download the entire Apple Arcade catalog just because. But this is one of those situations where the words most people are important. Most people don't need more than 64GB of storage. At least, that's what I think anyway.
But enough about me. I want to know what you're using and whether it's sufficient. I've attached a handy dandy pole for the purpose as well. And you know where the comments are, too!
Is 64GB enough for you?

    <h5 class="mb-1">The State Of PC Gaming In 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes, as borders erode, new fissures form in their wake. In 2019, more games flowed between PC and other platforms than ever before, but a single major division cracked the PC gaming landscape in half.
This year’s central throughline was undoubtedly the titanic clash between Valve and Epic, with Epic snatching up every high-profile exclusive it could get its hands on, much to some PC gamers’ chagrin. But this year also saw longtime console exclusives like Red Dead Redemption 2, Heavy Rain, Journey, and Halo: Reach complete their years-long migrations to PC, with other heavy hitters like Death Stranding announced for PC as well. Games flowed in the opposite direction too, with the Nintendo Switch opening its doors to countless indie games that traditionally would have been PC-only affairs. Streaming and subscription services like Google Stadia and Project xCloud muddied the waters even more, putting PC-game-like experiences on platforms you’d never have imagined playing them on years before (albeit still with plenty of kinks to work out).
There are still some console exclusives, of course, and PC gaming retains its unique identity through things like mods, hardware configurations as numerous as grains of sand on the beach, and its inextricable ties to Twitch and YouTube. Increasingly, though, the lines between these platforms are dissolving, and everybody’s winding up back where so many series and genres started: on PC. As for how companies decide to divvy that up, well, that’s a muddier and potentially uglier question.
Steam made some real strides in terms of functionality this year, but its 2019 was defined, for better or worse, by opposition. In January, PC gaming’s premier one-stop shop lost a major first-person shooter, Metro Exodus, to fresh-faced multi-million dollar upstart The Epic Games Store. In response to this sudden platform exclusivity deal (Exodus was slated to launch just a couple weeks after), Valve stamped the game’s Steam store page with a statement declaring the move to be “unfair to Steam customers.” Not long after, Steam users review bombed previous Metro games and sent harassing messages to developers, including original Metro book series author Dmitry Glukhovsky.
This became a pattern with high-profile Epic Store announcements. Games like Borderlands 3 were met with irate, spittle-spattered reviews that took aim at Epic rather than the games themselves, and the small team behind indie Animal Crossing-Pokemon mashup Oobletsnearly drowned in coordinated abuse that even flooded their own Discord. It’s hard not to place some of the blame on Valve, which—when faced with the idea that its note about unfairness and the broader Steam culture it cultivated were partially to blame—said that it didn’t intend for the comment to be a “lightning rod” and noted that it purposefully said nothing in regard to subsequent exclusives to avoid pouring more fuel on the fire.
Still, Epic Store rage continues to simmer among Steam users, despite Valve’s efforts to defuse some of the weapons that incensed users tend to employ. The practice of review bombing has been around far longer than the Epic Store, but Valve once again took aim at the review score-tanking tactic in March, this time saying it would remove “off-topic review bombs” from affected games’ scores. This has, in some ways, limited review bombs’ effectiveness, but the new system didn’t do much to dissuade fuming Borderlands bombers in April, and more review bombs—both negative and, weirdly, positive—have sprung up since.
Valve tried to grapple with other elements of Steam’s sometimes-pernicious culture too, but in its own inconsistent, characteristically Valve way. In March, the company faced heavy criticism for the presence of Rape Day, a self-described “game where you can rape and murder during a zombie apocalypse,” on the Steam store. Ultimately, Valve decided to remove the game despite the fact that it was not “illegal or straight up trolling,” Valve’s stated line in the sand on an otherwise laissez-faire platform. The company did a poor job of explaining the game’s removal, chalking it up to Rape Day posing “unknown costs and risks” and leaving it largely at that. This revealed what many already knew to be true: Steam continues to pick and choose which games are allowed on its “open” storefront, but it does so with a frustrating lack of transparency. A degree of moderation is far from a bad thing, but later this year, Valve snapped 1,000 games into Thanos dust and offered only the vaguest of explanations. It also irrevocably blocked a visual novel for “sexual conduct involving a minor” despite a seeming lack thereof, so you can see how the company’s approach has become a point of contention.
Valve tried to do right by developers in other ways this year, again to mixed results. It tried to improve users’ ability to discover new games with an experimental set of Steam Labs tools, including an interactive game recommender that scans playtime and suggests new games of varying levels of obscurity based on its findings. These features were well-received, but broadly, Steam users still tend to find most games through tried and true methods: word of mouth generated by marketing, gaming sites, YouTube, and Twitch and Steam’s own best-seller charts, store page recommendations, and wishlists. Valve does not have any direct involvement with the former handful of methods, but it tried to tweak the latter few throughout the year. During the Steam summer sale, it hosted a store-wide meta game whose bizarrely complicated rule set confused many users into deleting games from their Steam wishlists. This also drew attention to algorithm issues that some developers said had been plaguing Steam since October 2018. In September 2019, Valve said it tweaked the algorithm again in hopes of doing a better job of surfacing smaller games, but some indie developers said the change had the opposite of its intended effect.
Despite a rocky year when it came to addressing platform and culture issues, Valve did have a pretty big 2019 in other ways. The company must be commended for generally improving its communication around Steam, posting regular blog entries and explaining major changes—even if it still majorly falters when it comes to transparency around minute decisions that arguably affect the platform day to day just as much. New features like an overhauled Steam library, meanwhile, were well-received. And while the company took one game, Dota card game spin-off Artefact, back to the drawing board, it released another, Dota auto battler spin-off Dota Underlords, to mostly positive reception and announced the loooooooong-awaited return of Half-Life in “flagship” VR game Half-Life: Alyx.
Epic spent its year going toe to toe with Steam, but even when it only had to support its own behemoth weight with its megalithic feetsy-weetsies, it stumbled. Certainly, Epic succeeded when it came to locking down high-profile timed exclusives, enticing aforementioned heavy hitters like Borderlands 3 and indies of all stripes alike with minimum guarantees on sales that’d help ferry companies through the gaming industry’s consistently choppy waters. Here are just a few notable games Epic managed to snag: Control, Heavy Rain, John Wick Hex, Outer Worlds, Outer Wilds, Journey, The Division 2, and Untitled Goose Game.
In justifying the unpopular strategy, Epic continually cited its desire to push back against the industry standard of a 70/30 split between developers and platform holders (Epic instead offers an 88/12 split). “The 30% store tax usually exceeds the entire profits of the developer who built the game that’s sold. This is a disastrous situation for developers and publishers alike, so I believe the strategy of exclusives is proportionate to the problem,” said Epic founder Tim Sweeney in June, noting that he believes developers with more money will reinvest in the creation of more games and price reduction, both of which he sees as good things for people who regularly buy games. That is not to say, of course, that what Epic is doing is purely altruistic; it’s a gigantic company that’s first and foremost out to make money, and it can now do so through its store and developers who reinvest money into game development by—just spitballing here—licensing Epic’s Unreal game engine technology, the cornerstone of its business.
This rationale did not quell the extremely vocal minority behind the lion’s share of Epic Store rage, which was by that point trading in abuse and conspiracy theories (in addition to legitimate complaints) to justify concerns about issues Steam also either had semi-recently or continues to have. It did not help that Epic was slow to address legitimate grievances, coming out the gate with a threadbare offering that only improved moderately over the course of the year. Its first big sale, for example, was a communications disaster in which developers who, it turns out, did not agree to participate in the sale wound up temporarily removing their games from the store so as to avoid getting caught up in the deal maelstrom. Frequently requested features like cloud saves, meanwhile, took the better part of a year to finally arrive, and while Epic’s public roadmap for the store is a nice bit of transparency, other key features like social functionality and achievements remain slated for some unspecified “future.” The store needs to justify itself meaningfully if it wants to wipe away the stain of its lacking launch, and so far, it has resolutely failed to do that.
This year, both Valve and Oculus took their next bold steps into a VR future still limited by our present living rooms. For the high-end crowd, Oculus released the Oculus Rift S, meant to replace the first Oculus Rift, with improved hardware and the second generation of its Touch controllers. Valve, meanwhile, released its own VR headset, The Valve Index, that felt like a luxury successor to its 2016 collaboration with HTC, the Vive. However, in the Index’s case especially, VR remained a hassle to set up and use with any regularity. This continued to be a major barrier to entry.
But Oculus also debuted a promising vision of VR—aka the future’s—future. Released in May, the Oculus Quest, unlike other headsets, is completely wireless. This minimizes the muss and fuss of setup. “Within 15 minutes of opening the package containing the Oculus Quest, Facebook’s new standalone virtual reality headset, I was playing a game. I wasn’t playing some watered-down mobile phone app or preinstalled demo, but a full-featured, console-quality VR game,” said Kotaku’s Mike Fahey shortly after the headset’s launch.
That said, while there are now a great many VR games to choose from, none have achieved elusive “must buy” status. As a result, VR is still a niche within a niche, and Steam stats show that just over one per cent of users own VR headsets. Will that change next year? Potentially. In November, Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx, which many VR fans (and probably also Valve) are hoping will be VR’s long-awaited killer app. Maybe it will finally crowbar the VR floodgates open just a little wider, or maybe it won’t. But it will definitely let us become marauding, headcrab-tossing thorns in the side of a fascist alien regime in the cramped comfort of our own living rooms, so at the absolute least, there’s that.
In May, Xbox Game Pass came to Windows, bringing the console game subscription service to PC users. Though the service is still in beta, games like Halo: Reach, Gears 5, and TheOuter Worlds were launch-day titles, making Game Pass for PC a pretty attractive option. Not all PC games support cross play or play anywhere, which prevents players from swapping smoothly between their PC and console, but Game Pass for PC is still a pretty good deal that will hopefully only get better.
While Epic and Steam were this year’s most prominent rivals, they aren’t the only PC storefronts. GOG, CD Projekt Red’s store and launcher, got a redesign this year. Called GOG Galaxy 2.0, it promises the ability to bring your disparate games—including console games—into one library, along with your friends list and achievements. While it’s still in closed beta, GOG Galaxy 2.0 is a step toward the dream of not having to sort through a dozen launchers every time you want to play a game.
Rockstar released its own PC launcher this year as well with the Rockstar Launcher, which most prominently houses Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC. The launcher caused some issues for RDR2 on PC, but it brings Rockstar alongside the likes of publishers like Bethesda, EA, and Blizzard for places where you can download a game and then forget about it.
Things were pretty quiet on the other storefronts front. WoW Classic breathed some life in Battlenet, while platform mainstay Destiny 2 crossed over to the dark side and arrived on Steam. Apex Legends was a big draw for Electronic Arts’ Origin platform, but EA also brought its games back to Steam this year with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, as well as Apex Legends, The Sims 4, and more to follow. While Epic searches for every exclusive it can get its hands on, it seems like other companies are a little more willing to share the wealth.
Auto chess was the PC’s standout genre in 2019, springing out of a Dota mod and bringing Valve, Riot, and Blizzard’s own takes into the fold. Other than that, it feels like there weren’t many PC-exclusive standout games this year, with PC hit Outer Wilds now on console and many of the year’s other big games being multiplatform. Major releases like Metro Exodus, Outer Worlds, Borderlands 3, and Control were Epic exclusives, but they weren’t exclusive to PC. The Switch was a second home for many of the year’s best indie PC games, such as Baba Is You and Untitled Goose Game. 2019 felt marked by a slow chipping away at platform exclusivity overall, as games and studios that had long been console only crossed over to the PC side.
Red Dead Redemption 2’s November PC launch was rocky, but it still brought the hoped-for console game to PC. Studio Quantic Dream broke its long-time console exclusivity this year, bringing Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls to the Epic Games Store, with Detroit: Become Human coming next week. Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 came to PC, following last year’s PC release of Yakuza 0. Longstanding console exclusive Catherine came to Steam in January as Catherine Classic. With Death Stranding is on its way to PC next year, it feels like console exclusives are becoming a thing of the past.
Many of these big arrivals brought massive file sizes with them. Gears 5, Call of Duty, and Red Dead Redemption 2 all clocked in at over 100 GB. As games get more graphically intense, we’re sure to see even bigger file sizes. Might be time to start stocking up on SSDs.
Live, constantly-updating PC games like League of Legends continued to exist almost as platforms unto themselves, as did PC versions of games like Fortnite, Warframe, and World of Warcraft. Almost as important, PC remains the go-to platform for these games in the worlds of Twitch and YouTube. In 2019, this drove the platform’s relevance more than ever, whether it was through the record-breaking launch of World of Warcraft Classic or out-of-nowhere streaming sensations like No Pixel, a Grand Theft Auto V server modified for role-playing purposes that—while far from the first—rapidly became the biggest. Minecraft also had a resurgence on Twitch and YouTube, reinvigorating interest in a fiddly, sometimes un-intuitive experience that is quintessentially PC.
Some of these long-running games even got sequels this year, with Blizzard announcing Overwatch 2 and Grinding Gear Games debuting Path of Exile 2. Though not exactly a sequel, Fortnite’s Chapter 2 overhauled the megalith battle royale’s map and systems following an internet-breaking end-of-season stunt. All of these sequels are folding into their predecessors so as not to split player bases or the microtransaction-powered ecosystems those players log into every day. PC gaming pioneered the idea of online games as singular places you go to, individual islands you vacation to every day. Now it’s evolving that idea. Time will tell if it pays off for players, or if this new breed of sequel is just a thinly veiled cash grab.
On the Mac side of things, Apple’s Catalina update ended support for 32-bit apps, which meant the end of many classic and indie games. RIP.
Last year’s cryptocurrency mining-induced GPU shortage was over in 2019, and now we’re back to having to choose which graphics card to buy instead of grabbing whatever we could still find on the shelves. AMD and Nvidia continued their endless rivalry, with Nvidia releasing Super versions of its RTX 20 cards this year, while AMD fired back with the Radeon 5700 and 5700XT. As our colleagues at Gizmodo wrote, the Navi architecture undergirding the AMD cards is going to figure big into the next generation of console gaming. Alongside Nvidia cards’ ray tracing capabilities, 2019 felt less like giant leaps forward and more like a year of preparing for the future.
Ray tracing was announced last year, but 2019 felt like the year it was suddenly everywhere, with even Minecraft getting in on the action. Nvidia is leading the way on the fancy—and intensive—lighting effect technology with its RTX 20 series, though in April 2019, some of its older GPUs got pared-down versions of the ability as well. While ray tracing still isn’t ubiquitous, more games will be getting the ability in the future. This is cool, even if lighting effects are next to hair animations for the first of several features that many players turn off when a game won’t run smoothly.
Even as the lines surrounding traditional platforms grow hazier and less defined, Valve and Epic continue to duke it out, with no clear winner in sight. Next year will hopefully bring answers to some big questions: Will Epic keep up its exclusives-heavy strategy? Will it be able to get its store’s feature set up to speed in a timely fashion? Will Steam continue to try out new features and ideas, pressured as it seems to be by Epic’s store? Will developers be able to find stability in the midst of it all?
In addition, PC has become a battleground just as Sony and Microsoft prepare to release new consoles and continue the ceaseless, crashing dance that is contrived corporate rivalry. Next year will see consoles once again try to step up to the same level as high-ish end PCs, which will hopefully result in new games that push PC hardware a little more.
Increasingly, though, PC gaming seems determined to change our definition of what a platform even is. Individual games and the communities people form within them and around them—not to mention in gathering places like Discord and Reddit—function more and more as platforms of their own, to the point that companies like Blizzard and Epic are wary of breaking them up with traditional sequels to their colossal games. In the coming years, how will that impact the sorts of games people make and the way developers leverage higher-end hardware? Where will that leave PC gaming? It’s impossible to say, but we’re only just now beginning to see the first ripple effects of a complete sea change.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cryptocurrency Exchange - Here are tips to choose the best</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The exchange you must have decided to make use of will greatly determine whether your crypto investment will be profitable or not in the long run. There are lots of investors who have ignored this aspect of digital currency investment and eventually lost lots of money. In case you don't know, exchange is simply the gateway through which your cryptocurrencies will be traded. This is perhaps why you need to take out time and ensure the right one is chosen.  There are lots of exchanges to choose from which will even make your task of selecting one that can meet your needs more difficult. Here is the great part The good part about all of this is that you don't have to rack your brains on this subject matter again. This is because the major aim of this post is to list out some of those variables to consider while searching for a crypto exchange platform. Just ensure to follow these tips and your investments will be safe 100% of the time. Location is vital The first thing to consider about an exchanging platform is whether it is operating legally within your country. Countries vary when it comes to crypto regulations. Simply put, what may apply within a country may not apply in another one. Even in the United States, there are times states may vary when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations. Before deciding to sign up with any platform, ensure to always know whether its operations are in line with the legal stipulations of your location.  Reputation and authenticity There is one major problem about the cryptocurrency market at the moment which is the fact that barriers for getting into it are very few. This gives room for fraudulent dealers to get both potential and existing investors ripped off. Before deciding to register with any exchange, try to find out whether it has been registered as a company. It may shock you to know that most of these companies are only making false claims about their legal status. This is why you need to carry out every necessary investigation in order to safeguard your crypto investments. Also, you will have to be aware of bitcoin revolution scam speculations in the web and arrive at a clear view on your own. Check various social media platforms if you have to and find out whether others are using such exchange.  Consider security Crypto exchanges have been facing lots of security challenges over the years. While experts have predicted that this problem may not get better, there is still need for you to find out platforms which have improved security measures to ensure your investments are protected in the best way possible. A typical example of security challenges is the issue of $137million which was reportedly missing in QuadrigaCX after the demise of its founder. LiquidityThe higher the trade volumes; the higher the liquidity will be. It means your chosen exchange will be able to handle your orders much quicker. Avoid those exchanges that have very low trade volumes as this can affect your business more than imagined. Customer SupportThis entails trying to sign up with a platform where there is great support. It is only natural that you will experience one or two challenges along the line. Therefore, look out for a crypto exchange which will attend to your problems without any delay.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Battlefield 5 will be updated to include Wake Island and support custom games later this week, EA and DICE have advised.
Available from 13 December here in Australia, the update will add Wake Island to Battlefield 5‘s offerings. The map, originally from Battlefield 1842 and since featured in Battlefield 3, will be twice the size as the original Wake Island.
“On Wake Island, you’ll get up-close, attack straight on, or flank the enemy using amphibious vehicles,” DICE said, detailing the map. “Just as on the original map, the open sandbox design offers multiple approaches to any situation whether you’re invading or defending.”
Ahead of that, on 10 December, will be the addition of Community Games, or custom games. Players will be able to define settings inside custom games, password protecting them to prevent randoms from joining. The offering will be limited to begin with and will expand in the coming weeks.
Head here for a list of planned features.
Battlefield 5 is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox One and PS4.

What’s compact, boxy, and can be found at your local Kia dealer? No, not the Soul – if you’ve even heard of Kia’s now departed, upright, space-maximising, SUV-aping hatch you’re doing well.
The newest addition to Kia’s range, both in Australia and around the world, is the Seltos. It is a new small SUV designed to slot in underneath the Sportage and vying to become a household name.
The 2020 Kia Seltos Sport you see here is all about urban. Like regular hatchbacks (Kia’s own Cerato, Toyota Corolla, Hyundai i30 and the rest), entry-level versions of the Seltos are front-wheel drive only.
That’s no real surprise when most of the small SUVs the Seltos Sport competes with offer a similar mechanical layout. If you want all-paw grip that’s reserved for more powerful and higher-spec versions.
In the case of the Seltos Sport, $29,490 drive-away pricing gets you into a variant one up from the entry-level Seltos S. Under the bonnet there’s a 2.0-litre naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine and a CVT automatic transmission, with no manual option.
There’s 110kW of power and 180Nm of torque to delve into. Not segment leading, no, but absolutely up to the task (more on that in a moment).
There’s also a decent amount of size for a small SUV. On the outside, the Seltos measures 4370mm long, 1800mm wide and 1615mm tall. As a reference point, the evergreen Mitsubishi ASX is 5mm shorter, 10mm wider and 25mm taller. The Seltos does a better job on boot space, though, with 433L to use compared to the ASX’s 393L, and it manages to feel more spacious inside, even though it rides on a shorter wheelbase (2360mm, or 310mm less).
Interior space is key here, and is likely the reason you’re shopping for an SUV instead of a regular hatch in the first place. Alongside Kia’s own Cerato hatch, the Seltos boasts just five additional litres of luggage capacity, but feels more airy inside with its tall roof and upright stance, plus boasts a rear seat that can be reclined slightly to the benefit of passenger comfort.
Quality of the interior fit-out seems seems good, but buyer perceptions might be swayed by the wealth of hard plastics. Nothing’s low-grade, but there are solid unyielding surfaces covering the dash, upper door cards and armrests. Hardly a problem when it comes to robustness and longevity, but surely some padding under your elbow isn’t too much to ask?
There are also allusions to the Seltos being built to a price (the range starts from $25,990 drive-away) with a detent in the dash plastics ahead of the driver. It’s for the space allocated to the head-up display in the flagship GT-Line model, but all Seltos models come with the filler panel for it.
Comparatively, spec levels are far from spartan. Opting for the Seltos Sport means access to a whopping 10.25-inch widescreen infotainment display. One of the biggest in its class (the Seltos S uses an 8.0-inch display), it brings additional tech like embedded satellite navigation and digital radio to go along with Bluetooth, smartphone mirroring for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and six-speaker audio.
Snappy loading, three-window home screen displays, split-screen apps (of the inbuilt variety, not downloadable), easy to decipher menus and a polished user interface make the system thoroughly decent to use.
While the infotainment upgrade is the most noticeable change, Sport trim also brings 17-inch alloy wheels instead of 16-inch steel wheels, power-folding mirrors with inset indicators, solar-cut glass, an extra USB charge point up front, premium leather-look steering wheel wrap, and single-zone climate control.
Otherwise, you’re treated to cloth trim on the seats, manual adjustment for the front seats, tilt- and reach-adjustable steering, traditional gauges with a monochrome trip computer display, key-in start, and a covered console with armrest.
There’s plenty of interior storage, door bins with bottle holders front and rear, useful space in the centre console and glovebox, and Kia’s now commonplace two-level centre stack bin that lets you rest your phone up top and keep your wallet and keys down low.
There’s a good chance the Seltos will find its way into the driveways of SINKs, DINKs and empty-nesters, but if you are thinking of one as a family car, note the lack of face-level air vents in the rear of the centre console.
On the utility front, there are four tie-down points in the boot to clip an accessory luggage net to, but oddly no parcel shelf or cargo blind, meaning your odds and ends are always on display. There’s only one bag hook, too, limiting day-to-day versatility a little.
In better news, Kia has stuck with a full-sized alloy spare wheel in the boot. The look of the spare isn’t important, but for buyers outside of urbanised areas, a full-size spare is worth its weight in gold.
Take to the road and the Seltos impresses. It might not be the most powerful engine available in its class (110kW and 180Nm from a 2.0-litre engine are at the lower end), but the Seltos runs what’s known as an Atkinson cycle that favours efficiency over outputs.
The Seltos also features an Aussie first for the brand with a CVT automatic in place of a traditional auto. The upside is a seamless, shiftless transmission as you potter about town, and Kia has managed to tune out most of the CVT downsides like the droning soundtrack and ‘stretchy’ feel under acceleration.
It’ll imitate a regular auto with stepped gear changes when you drive with authority, and revert to smoother operations as you dial things back. It can exhibit minor rev flare or hunting at steady speeds where the road meets an incline, but nothing too out of place.
The engine itself feels punchy enough to hold its own in the merciless thrust of city traffic, is quiet and subtle at cruising speeds, and officially rated to use 6.8 litres of petrol per 100km, though on test – in 90 per cent urban driving – the fuel meter settled on 8.4L/100km.
As with all other models in Kia’s range, the Seltos has had ride and handling tuned to Australian conditions. The result is good body control over suburban roads – no jarring or bobbing over bigger hits without being too firm.
There’s positive steering feel, and a not too heavy, not too light balance that makes parking easy but freeway driving steady. As speeds rise, there’s no loss of composure or comfort either, and wind and tyre noise remain hushed.
Warranty coverage spans seven years with no distance limit for private buyers (or 160,000km for commercial-use cars). Capped-price servicing is available at 12-month/15,000km intervals for seven years at $261, $452, $324, $584, $293, $593 and $311 per visit – or $2818 in total.
With regard to safety systems, all Seltos models feature six airbags, front seatbelt pretensioners, three top tether and two ISOFIX child seat mounts, traction and stability control, rear park sensors, reverse camera, lane-keep assist, driver-attention monitoring, and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) with car and pedestrian detection.
An optional safety pack (as fitted) is available for the Seltos S and Seltos Sport, which adds more advanced versions of AEB operating at higher speeds and with radar monitoring to allow cyclist detection, adaptive cruise control, upscaled driver-attention alert, and an electric park brake.
Even higher up the range, there’s more on offer like lane-following assist, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, but nothing essential is missing from either the basic or safety-pack-equipped Seltos Sport.
Kia’s specifications do create something of a split. With a price just over $31K ($31,010 as tested with metallic paint and safety pack), some of the interior seems bare. It’s all impressive to look at, and the infotainment screen is absolutely the star, but the tactility is lacking – not unusual for the segment, but still a little jarring.
Utility is also a little short. There’s no innovative configurable cargo space or flexible seating, just a regular split-folding seat. That’s fine, but surely even a cargo cover wouldn’t be too much to ask at $20K, let alone $30K?
It can be forgiven, though, when you look at the safety spec sheet. There are a few more premium features higher up the range, sure, but a full suite of safety kit comes standard on the Sport, and just $1000 more lands the convenience of adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality along with some extra peace-of-mind system support.
Here’s the tricky part, though: if your budget can stretch just a little further, $31,990 drive-away would put you behind the wheel of a Cerato GT.
While a warmed-over hatch or sedan and an SUV aren’t quite an apples-for-apples comparison, it’s hard to ignore Kia’s internal competition. A more powerful engine, leather trim, powered driver's seat, keyless entry and start, dual-zone climate control, blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are just some of the lures on team Cerato.
You have to reconcile a smaller infotainment screen and a lack of high-seated visibility, but in raw value terms, the Cerato puts up a fair fight.
The Seltos Sport is credible and comfortable, utterly orthodox in terms of the segment, but still surprising enough with how it looks. It acts as a much-needed gap-closer in the Kia range, and should only serve to continue the brand’s steady growth in Australia.
Before you sign on the dotted line, though, be sure to take a walk around your local Kia showroom. The Seltos might not be the only appealing model you find.

UPDATE: Some glamorous new Australian-market photos have been added to this article. You can read our first drive review of the 2019 McLaren GT here.
August 30, 2019: McLaren has this week given its latest creation, known simply as the GT, its Australian debut in Sydney.
Promising class-leading performance, comfort and space, the new GT is positioned in the marque’s Sports Series line-up and priced at $399,995 before on-road costs – slightly higher above its 570S sibling ($395,000) but below the existing 570GT($415,000).
For the first time, this McLaren features luggage space up front and down back, the latter able to swallow a golf bag or two pairs of 185cm skis and boots, as well as some luggage, while up front there’s another 150L of storage space for a total of 570L.
Access to the rear load space is through a front-hinged, electrically-operated full-length glazed tailgate with a soft-close function, in line with the GT's luxury standing.
Some buyers will want to make it easy for themselves and opt for McLaren’s customised four-piece luggage set including a garment case, weekend bag, cabin bag and full-size golf bag available through the dealers.
McLaren also claims plenty of space inside the cabin and great all-round vision thanks to the GT’s glass wraparound cockpit.
The new GT also utilises new high-tech fabrics as an option in the luggage bay. Dubbed SuperFabric and originally developed by NASA, it works alongside new sound- and light-suppressing technology to reduce glare and noise.
Buyers can even choose the super-soft and super-lightweight fabric Cashmere option to further enhance the cabin.
Armed with the a mid-mounted 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 driving the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, the new GT makes 456kW of power and 630Nm of torque – substantially more than the current 570 line-up that makes do with 419kW and 600Nm.
Performance is improved, too, dropping 0.2 seconds on the 570 GT to complete the benchmark 0-100km/h sprint in 3.2 seconds.
That’s commendable given the GT tips the scales at 1530kg with fluids and 90 per cent fuel of its 72L fuel tank filled (DIN kerb weight).
McLaren also claim there’s no compromise to the car’s handling due in part to the lowering of the engine’s position in the chassis by 100mm to make room for the luggage as well as providing the brand’s trademark handling.
The GT also gets completely new suspension, steering and brakes for new levels of isolation from bumps and noise, but without any lessening of feel for those behind the wheel.
That’s also the reason it’s able to negotiate speed bumps (even without the front lift kit) thanks to a larger approach angle than ever before. McLaren claims it’s one of the quietest cars in the class.
Expect the first cars to arrive in arrive in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2019.
All prices exclude on-road costs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PlayStation Now Australia release potentially teased by ad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Australian release of PlayStation Now may have just been teased after an ad for the service was spotted on PS4 dashboards over the weekend.
First spotted by Press-Start, the ad appeared on the Australian-facing PS4 PlayStation Store, though when clicked displayed a page that read, “this content cannot be selected at this time.”
“We have nothing to announce at this time,” a Sony Interactive Entertainment spokesperson told Stevivor when asked about PlayStation Now Australian availability or if the ad was incorrectly placed.
PlayStation Now is a streaming service that offers a library of over 800 PS2, PS3 and PS4 games for $9.99 USD a month. The service is currently avaliable in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In September 2018, subscribers have been able to download and play select games rather than stream them — something that’s likely quite important if we’re talking about an Australian release.
The final PlayStation State of Play for 2019 will take place later this week; we may see an annoucement then.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thanks to the nostalgic wave of retro machines that has yet to crest, we learned earlier this year that the 8-bit 1980s gaming machine was getting a proper, full sized version. The C64, as it's called, was announced with a December launch window. Now, it seems the full-sized C64 is available for pre-order in Europe and will begin shipping soon.
The Commodore 64 has already received tribute in the form of last year's Commodore 64 Mini, and like other retroconsoles before it, it served as a fun nostalgia trip (albeit on a smaller scale) but still received mixed reviews. Reviewers took particular issue with the joystick.
The C64 not only promises a full-sized keyboard, but an updated joystick as well. The full-sized keyboard will also allow users to load their own programs with multi-disk compatibility. The C64 will offer three switchable modes: C64, Vic-20, and Games Carousel Mode. There's also support for 720p HD output at 60Hz or 50Hz.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft to kill off support for its Windows 10 Mobile Office apps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Way back in July 2017, Microsoft officially pulled the plug on the Windows Phone, and its focus on Windows 10 Mobile was waning rapidly. The inevitable happened in January this year, when the Redmond firm said free support for all Windows 10 Mobile products would end on December 10—tomorrow—which means no more security updates, non-security hotfixes, free assisted support options, or online technical content updates.
But what about Microsoft’s suite of Windows 10 Mobile Office apps, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote? They still have a while before reaching their end-of-support date: January 12, 2021.
The Office apps will still work after that date, but users won’t be able to install them on phones using Windows 10 Mobile. Additionally, there’ll be no more technical support, bug fixes, or security updates.
"Because of the lack of security updates, we strongly recommend that if you wish to use Office on a phone you transition to the latest Microsoft Office apps on an iOS or Android phone," wrote Bill Doll, senior product marketing manager for Office apps strategy at Microsoft.
Microsoft started stepping away from Windows 10 Mobile in 2016, so killing off support for its Office apps isn’t too much of surprise—Facebook did the same thing with its application earlier this year. But with the company’s Surface Duo—a dual-screen, Android-powered smartphone—arriving in 2020, Microsoft’s next mobile venture could be a lot more successful.

    <h5 class="mb-1">HP Omen X 27 Review: The Fastest 1440p Gaming Monitor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This is the first HP gaming monitor we've ever reviewed and it's a special one, with an entirely new spec and milestone that recently hit the market. The HP Omen X 27 is a standard 1440p display (2560 x 1440), but it pushes the refresh rate up to 240Hz for the first time. We’ve had 240Hz available on 1080p monitors for some time, but 1440p hasn’t been able to step up to the super high refresh podium until now with these modern panels.
It won’t be a surprise to many of you that 1440p at 240Hz requires a TN panel. These days we do see some 1080p 240Hz panels using IPS and VA, but as 1080p 240Hz starts getting upgraded to better technology, TN starts to hit 240Hz at higher resolutions. This is somewhat of a comeback for TN at 1440p, given the vast majority of 1440p gaming monitors in the past few years have been released with either IPS or VA panels at up to 165Hz.
Other key specs of the HP Omen include its flat 27-inch screen size, 1ms rated response times, adaptive sync support with FreeSync 2 HDR (no VESA DisplayHDR spec) and a suggested retail price of $650. We've seen it as low as $500, but that $650 MSRP suggests this is a premium product.
The most striking thing when you take the HP Omen X 27 out of the box is its unique design. Most monitor companies stick with the basic pronged metal stand with a pillar, which is functional and looks good most of the time. But HP has gone with distinctly their own aesthetic, which includes a thin rectangular stand pillar connected to a heavy square metal base. Personally I think this looks awesome.
Everything about the build exudes premium quality. The stand is entirely metal, the seams as materials transition from one thing to another are tight and well built, plus the rear section with its triangular pattern looks fantastic even if it’s entirely plastic. As far as materials go, this is definitely one of the best built monitors I’ve seen.
While the design is excellent, there have been some sacrifices to functionality. One is with stand adjustability: you do get height adjustment which is nice, plus the usual tilt capability, but due to the rectangular connection to the display there is no swivelling or pivoting capabilities. So you can’t use the monitor in a portrait orientation.
Ports are also limited. You get a two-port USB hub and an easy to access headphone jack, but there's just one DisplayPort and one HDMI input. That’s enough for a single PC and single console connection, but plenty of other monitors these days have three or four ports, which is what we’d have liked to see here, too.
The other issue comes with the on-screen controls. Not only do we have a fairly chunky bottom bezel – the side bezels are fine – but we also don’t have a directional toggle or buttons along the bottom edge. Instead, the OSD buttons are actually on the rear side, and to control them you have to fumble and reach around the bottom bezel to find them. It’s not a great control system and I frequently found myself pressing the wrong thing.
HP’s OSD itself is good, the menu is straightforward and includes decent gamer features like cheat crosshairs, refresh rate displays, and controls for the single ambient lighting LED on the bottom edge. Perhaps one missing feature is a backlight strobing mode, though perhaps not as necessary with such a high refresh rate.
Speaking of the refresh rate, let’s talk about the combination of 1440p and 240Hz. We're getting adaptive sync, so it works with AMD and Nvidia GPUs, plus low framerate compensation, as you’d expect from a modern gaming monitor. But the big jump is from a max refresh rate of 165Hz like we used to see with 1440p monitors, up to 240 Hz.
If you’re thinking you can run modern AAA games at above 165 FPS in 2019, even with a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti… think again. While the 2080 Ti is undoubtedly a high-end GPU, in the most demanding titles you’re looking at between 100 and 140 FPS using Ultra settings at 1440p. That allows you to max out a 1440p 144Hz display most of the time, but isn’t going to make a 240 Hz display worth it. So if you’re the sort of gamer that plays titles like Borderlands 3 and Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, upgrading to 240Hz isn’t going to make much sense until we have next-generation GPUs.
Where 240Hz does make sense at 1440p is with competitive games. 1080p 240Hz has been the gold standard for a while now, but at 1440p you can often still run these titles at super high frame rates while benefiting from the added spatial information from the higher resolution. I find it easier to spot enemies at 1440p versus 1080p, especially on a 27-inch monitor, and especially when we’re talking about distant enemies. Similar to why competitive players often recommend low settings but ultra draw distances: seeing high quality shadows doesn’t matter too much, but being able to easily spot enemies in the distance does.
If you do have a high-end rig -- we're talking RTX 2080 Ti and Core i9-9900K -- you can often play games like Rainbow Six Siege, Fortnite on medium settings, Overwatch, Rocket League… those sorts of titles at or above 200 FPS at 1440p. This is where a 240Hz monitor gives you improved clarity and smoothness over 144Hz, and while the difference is subtle, the more I’ve used 240Hz over the last few years, the more it feels like an upgrade over 144Hz in these games. For anything fast motion, more Hz is better.
Future proofing aside, having a 1440p 240Hz monitor really is only in the realm of super high-end gaming rigs. If you don’t have a fast gaming CPU like Intel’s 8700K or 9900K, paired with a top-end GPU like the RTX 2080 Super or preferably the RTX 2080 Ti, at least in 2019, 1440p 240Hz probably isn’t for you. In a few year's time hopefully the requirements will drop down a bit like 1080p 240Hz has, but for now it’s a high-end thing.
So how does the HP Omen X 27 perform at 1440p and 240Hz? As you probably would expect from a TN panel, it does fare pretty well in response times. There are four overdrive modes available, but the first two – Level 1 and Level 2 – aren’t worth using given they don’t get the best out of the panel. These modes aren’t terrible given response times are in the 5ms range with minimal overshoot, but we can do better.
Level 1 and Level 2
Level 3 is the optimal mode for this monitor. Here we are getting fast performance as you’d hope from TN. The overall grey to grey average is just 3.13ms and you can tell from the visual charts that most transitions are extremely quick at 240Hz, some as low as 1.2ms. Dark level performance is very good, so there’s no smearing there either, not that this is unusual for a TN panel.
Level 3
The best part comes with refresh rate compliance, 90% of transitions are within 1ms of the refresh rate window, which is a tight 4.17ms when refreshing at 240Hz. This means that smearing isn’t an issue even at 240Hz, as the monitor is generally fast enough to transition its pixels before it has to refresh the screen for the next image. What we’re left with is true 240 Hz performance and the extremely responsive, low blur experience that provides. Error rates are also very good, no issues to speak of, you won’t see inverse ghosting at this refresh rate.
The fastest available overdrive mode, Level 4, does push the average grey to grey transition down to 1.77ms, but it does so at the expense of high levels of overshoot. 36% of transitions had overshoot above 15%, many transitions above 20% ,which does cause inverse ghost trails in fast motion. This isn’t a mode I’d recommend.
Level 4
Level 3 is definitely the overdrive mode to choose, and this holds up well throughout the refresh rate range. Even if you’re gaming at 120Hz using adaptive sync, performance is still excellent, at a 3.16ms average response time. Overshoot does increase the slower the refresh rate is, increasing from an average error of 3.0% at 240Hz to 7.9% at 60Hz, but none of these refresh rates exhibit much inverse ghosting so that’s why I’d set this monitor to Level 3 and forget. Even performance at 60Hz is great for console gaming.
How does the Omen X 27 stack up to other monitors? When looking at grey to grey average we’re right in the zone for TN monitors at between 2 and 4ms. The Omen X is a step up from the Viotek GFT27DB we reviewed earlier this year, which is a 1440p 144Hz monitor, although we aren’t moving the needle much in terms of delivering faster-than-usual response times. Not that this is necessary, as TN technology has been fast enough for 240Hz refresh rates at 1440p for a while now, it’s just about bringing up to speed other areas of the display like the scaler.
We also see performance very close to Gigabyte’s Aorus KD25F, one of the ultra-fast 0.5ms class 240Hz panels at 1080p. So at least for response times, we’re equivalent to 1080p monitors at this refresh rate.
Dark level performance is obviously not an issue for TN monitors, that’s only a consideration for VA. And while refresh rate compliance isn’t chart topping, anything above 70 to 80% is vert good. With 91% compliance from the Omen X 27, this is more than enough for an excellent 240Hz experience and you won’t get much better from other options.
The average error chart isn’t the most useful in our reviews, but what we do see here is that the latest generation 1080p 240Hz panel used in the KD25F, which has 0.5ms class response times, is marginally faster than the 1440p 240Hz panel used. That’s because while both options have 3ms response time averages, the KD25F does so at a lower error rate. This doesn’t mean much in practice as in my opinion they offer an equivalent experience but for those that are interested in panel technology, it seems 1080p still has a slight lead.
As we mentioned earlier, inverse ghosting is a non issue with the HP Omen X 27 at its optimal overdrive mode, although the headroom is absorbed at lower refresh rates, which having increasing but still manageable overshoot.
And even at 60Hz this is still a very fast monitor, with response times still around that 3ms mark, which is impressive and makes the monitor great for adaptive sync use as we know ghosting remains largely unchanged throughout the refresh rate range.
The Omen X 27 is the fastest monitor we’ve tested so far, with functionally zero input lag. When that’s combined with such a high refresh rate and quick transitions, we are getting 5ms of latency between the monitor receiving an input and fully displaying it on the screen. That’s incredible and leads to chart topping performance by a decent margin.
All of this does come at higher than usual power consumption for a 27-inch monitor. Power usage is more than 50% higher than the Viotek GFT27DB and other TN panels, which may concern you, or it might not given we’re still below 40 watts.
Color performance is surprisingly excellent from the HP Omen X 27, too. This is a wide gamut monitor, however even when measuring against sRGB we see good things. For starters, grayscale performance is very good out of the box, with just a deltaE average of 1.27. As usual, we’re targeting below 2.0, so this is very accurate.

The CCT curve is also decent and while our unit was tinted very slightly towards the yellow end out of the box, this is a nitpick really and you won’t get anything better outside of full calibration. Saturation performance is affected mostly by the unclamped gamut, but this only delivers moderately inaccurate results due to oversaturation; there are no other issues. Yes, we do see deltaE averages above 2.0 in saturation, but surprisingly in ColorChecker this is below 2.0, which is very good.
This allows it to deliver extremely strong factory calibration performance compared to other gaming monitors, which typically report in with deltaEs between 3.0 and 4.0. Were an sRGB clamp available in the settings, no doubt this would be one of the most accurate gaming monitors you can buy from the factory.
There isn’t much room to tweak things further in the OSD menu, not only is the monitor quite accurate anyway out of the box, but the color controls are quite fiddly and hard to get fine control over. We’d just leave this monitor in its default configuration, which includes contrast at 80, gamma set to 2.2 and sharpness at level 4.

After a full calibration we can improve things further to deliver excellent color performance. Greyscale was already a non issue although this has been tightened up slightly. It’s in the saturation and ColorChecker graphs where we see the advantages of the color profile, which allows us to display both sRGB and P3 images properly in supported applications. Here with sRGB performance, we see deltaE averages around the 0.5 mark thanks to 100% sRGB coverage.
Wide gamut P3 performance isn’t as strong, although it’s not bad compared to monitors that have no wide gamut ability. The main problem is my unit only had native 87% coverage of P3, which drops to 85% when calibrated. So when you look at saturation sweeps for example, yes the average is decent, but top end performance is clipped as the very outer edges of P3 cannot be displayed. There are a variety of reasons why you wouldn’t want a TN monitor for creative work but below 90% coverage of P3 is one item on the list.
Brightness in the SDR mode is mid tier, although anything above 300 nits is bright enough for most environments. Where this panel really suffers is with viewing angles, which are poor. There is a significant color shift at horizontal and vertical off angles, unless you view this monitor from front on at the perfect angle, you’ll run into trouble with desaturation. Even with this new generation of 1440p TNs, yeah the same TN viewing angle issues are still present.
The contrast ratio is also quite weak, at just 833:1 when calibrated. Blacks just don’t get very black, and while there are no major backlight bleed issues at least with my unit, if you’re viewing this monitor in a dark environment you’ll notice that blacks are more like a dark grey. Again, common for all but VA and OLED monitors, but it is a downside of TN technology.
As for uniformity, pretty decent, small amount of falloff along the left edge but other than that, a uniform experience through the center region. Seems HP are using a good quality panel, as you’d hope given its price tag.
The HP Omen X 27 is also an HDR capable monitor. Surprisingly it hasn’t received any DisplayHDR badges, although it does come with FreeSync 2 HDR support. Let’s see how it fares in the checklist.
This is a curious monitor in that it gets halfway there with each of the three main pillars of HDR. For brightness, the monitor can sustain 450 nits easily, but can’t push up to 600 nits. For contrast we do get some local dimming with 16 edge lit zones, but we don’t have the full array or high zone count necessary for an excellent experience. And while the monitor is wide gamut capable, around 87% P3 coverage falls just short of the 90% we ideally want to see as a minimum.
Where this leaves us in practice is an HDR experience that’s better than SDR, but only slightly better, and really nowhere near the full HDR experience you’d get from a proper HDR monitor. Take brightness for example, for small details such as bright light in a dark scene, we do get up to 470 nits. But we don’t get the piercing 1000+ nits of the best HDR panels.
The absolute best contrast ratio we can achieve in the HDR mode is around 6,000:1 with the Omen X, which admittedly is more than 6x higher than the panel’s default SDR contrast without local dimming. But that’s not that impressive against even semi-HDR monitors like the LG 32UL650 with DisplayHDR 600 certification. And in our single-frame contrast tests, again the Omen X falls behind the pack due to its low zone count.
I wouldn’t completely rule out using the HDR mode as it does provide a minor advantage over SDR and the large local dimming zones aren’t too noticeable during regular gaming usage. But the HDR experience isn’t as good as true HDR monitors, which are much more expensive. We just don’t think TN is a good technology for HDR.
But let’s forget about HDR performance because we don’t think you’ll be buying the Omen X 27 for that feature. What you’ll be interested in is the combination of a 1440p resolution and 240 Hz refresh rate. That’s the star of the show and it’s always exciting and interesting to test these sorts of new panels with new technologies.
The HP Omen X 27 is a great gaming monitor. There are some issues brought about from using a TN panel, but that's nothing unusual for this panel type and everything else is excellent. Response times are fast enough to keep up with the 240 Hz refresh rate with a bit of room to spare, so even though we are getting an increase to resolution over older 1080p 240Hz monitors, nothing has changed as far as performance is concerned. This is a really quick monitor that delivers a top-class, highly responsive gaming experience.
HP has also delivered excellent adaptive sync support including tight response times throughout the refresh range, plus virtually zero input lag. This is one of the fastest and most responsive monitors we’ve ever tested, which is especially exciting given we’re getting this with a higher resolution than just 1080p.
Color performance is very strong from the factory, surprisingly so for a gaming monitor that doesn’t boast about factory calibration anywhere on ths spec sheet. A few minor oversaturation issues can easily be corrected with a software profile but even if you don’t use a profile, this monitor has great colors.
Most of the downsides are standard TN stuff. Poor viewing angles and a weak contrast ratio are standard and the key tradeoff for elite performance. If you game in a dark room, the higher than average black levels may annoy you. And while we really love the design and build quality, there are some annoyances there, too, like a hard to use on-screen menu.
But most of those issues really aren’t that significant, if you want the absolute fastest 1440p monitor on the market, there are some tradeoffs to be made. My bigger concern is more to do with the price and whether you should buy a 1440p 240Hz monitor at all.
The good news is that the HP Omen X 27 is much cheaper than their only other competitor with the same specs, the Lenovo Legion Y27gq-25. Lenovo’s offering is an eye watering $1,000, although it usually sells for $900. With the Omen X 27 priced at $650, why you would spend the extra money?
However as far as 1440p displays go, $650 is still pricey. This is definitely something for ultra high-end gamers that already have a well equipped rig with a Core i9-9900K and RTX 2080 Ti because realistically, that’s the sort of hardware you need to drive games at this resolution and frame rate.
Most other people could be better off with LG’s 27GL850 if your hardware can’t max out a 1440p 144Hz display. It’s still a lightning quick monitor in terms of response times and input lag, but it has better viewing angles and a wider color gamut than the HP Omen X 27 thanks to LG's Nano IPS technology. It’s also $150 cheaper comparing regular retail prices, which at $500 for the 27GL850 we think is justifiable for a high-end 1440p high refresh display.
Don’t get us wrong, the HP Omen X 27 is a really great monitor that delivers excellent performance, it’s just one of those more niche offerings for a super high-end audience. There is definitely a place for it in the market and we love to see new panel tech like this, but before you run out and buy one, look at the rest of your PC's hardware and decide what's most suitable for you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ryzen 9 3950X vs. Core i9-9900KS Gaming, Feat. Tuned DDR4 Memory Performance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today we’re comparing the Ryzen 9 3950X and Core i9-9900KS in a massive number of games, using one of G.Skill’s most premium 16GB memory kits, the Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600 CL14. For those of you spending $600 or $750 on a CPU, purchasing best in class DDR4 memory doesn’t seem like a stretch, but the main reason we went with this memory was so we could bring you a head to head comparison between AMD and Intel processors using manually tuned timings.
It was discovered in the early days of AMD’s Zen architecture that memory bandwidth and latency were crucial for maximizing performance of Ryzen processors. Manually tuning up the secondary and tertiary timings can consistently improve Ryzen’s performance in games.
In other words, this is a comparison of Intel and AMD's top desktop CPUs that do not belong to their HEDT series, with both processors tweaked for maximum memory performance.
For this Ryzen 9 3950X vs. Core i9-9900KS comparison we have tested a total of 18 games at 1080p using a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Both CPUs were tested in their stock out of the box configuration with XMP for the Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600 CL14 memory loaded. Then we have added a second configuration which sees the G.Skill memory timings manually tuned. The Core i9 was installed on a Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Ultra and, while Ryzen 9 used the Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master.
Before we jump into the gaming benchmarks, here’s a quick look at memory bandwidth. As you can see the tuned timings only boost bandwidth by 4% for the 3950X and 3% for the 9900KS.
Memory latency for the 3950X was also only reduced by 5% and 3% for the 9900KS, so based on those figures you wouldn’t expect much of a performance gain in games, but as you’re about to see that’s not the case.
The first game we tested is Hitman 2 where the 9900KS is 21% faster than the 3950X out of the box, quite a significant performance margin. However, the 3950X enjoys a massive 24% performance boost with the tuned memory, going from 117 fps on average up to an impressive 145 fps.
The 9900KS also benefits from tuned memory though, not quite to the same degree as Ryzen but we still see a 10% performance uplift in this title which is enough for Intel to keep the lead, albeit a smaller 8% margin.
Next up we have Resident Evil 2 and here the 3950X performs exceptionally well with the CL14 DDR4-3600 memory, slightly edging out the 9900KS both stock and tuned. For this title the tuned memory has almost no impact on performance, at most we see a 3% increase in 1% low performance.
Moving on to Project Cars 2 we see another mild 3% performance gain for the 9900KS.
The 3950X gained a more noteworthy 11 fps for an 8% increase in frame rate. Not mind-blowing but it’s enough to place AMD ahead of Intel in this title, particularly when looking at 1% low performance.
Gains in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege are uneventful for both processors. We’re looking at a ~3% increase which has Intel offering a 4% performance increase, though with tightly grouped 1% low performance the experience was identical using either CPU.
Here are some interesting results in Battlefield V. Tuning up the memory with the 9900KS has virtually no impact on performance, besides a 5% improvement in 1% low performance. That’s nothing compared to the 21% increase in 1% low performance seen by the 3950X. The average frame rate was also boosted by 17%. This was enough to put the 3950X just ahead of the 9900KS, though it was slightly down for the 1% low metric. Still once turned up, these CPUs enable an identical gaming experience.
Out of the box the 9900KS is 5% faster than the 3950X when testing with Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, or an extra 3 fps. With the tuned memory that margin shrinks to 2.5% and now we're looking at a 1-2 fps difference, so the same gaming experience with either processor.
Moving on we have the World of Tanks results and here we’re looking at up to a 4% increase from the memory tuning, pretty pointless for this title. Also these numbers can’t be compared to prior World of Tanks results as we’re using an updated replay for testing.
We’ve also updated our Metro Exodus test, we're now in a much latter section of the game that is more demanding. Interestingly, although the 1% low performance is identical between the 3950X and 9900KS, the Intel CPU is quite a bit faster when comparing the average frame rate, 14% faster out of the box and 9% once both CPUs are using the tuned memory timings.
In Fortnite, Intel’s Core i9-9900KS sees almost no improvement with the tuned memory, we’re talking just 2-3 fps at well over 100 fps. The 3950X enjoys a 5-10% performance boost, but even so once tuned up the 9900KS was still 9% faster when comparing 1% low data.
This time it’s the 9900KS that benefits the most from the tuned memory as the average frame rate is increased by 5% and the 1% low result by 14%. Even so this meant the 9900KS was just 2.5% faster than the 3950X, so the same performance then.
Performance in the The Division 2 is a little unusual, out of the box both CPUs allowed for a 1% low result of 110 fps and yet despite that the average frame rate of the 9900KS was still 15% higher. Once both CPUs were using the tuned timings though the 3950X produced a much better 1% low result and now the 9900KS was just 6% faster when comparing the average frame rate.
The tuned DDR4 memory configuration only provided a 2 to 4% performance uplift for the 9900KS when testing with World War Z. The 3950X wasn’t much better as it only saw a 5 to 7% performance boost, though that was enough to reduce the 9900KS lead down to 4%. And on a final note we once again we see both CPUs enabling frame rates so high, that the single digit % margins mean virtually nothing.
When testing with F1 2019 we see little performance difference with the tuned memory timings, though the 9900KS saw its winning margin reduced from 6% down to 3%, so yet another title were the gaming experience is identical even at 1080p with an RTX 2080 Ti.
Ghost Recon Breakpoint isn’t responsive to the tuned memory, here we see basically no improvement for either CPU and this means the 9900KS was still 6% faster. Pretty terrible optimization in this title though we have to say, less than 100 fps for both CPUs with an RTX 2080 Ti at 1080p.
We see a similar thing with Red Dead Redemption 2 if we didn't manually set everything to high. Here we’re looking at up to a 5% performance improvement with the turned memory, so nothing worth talking about. The performance margin between the 9900KS and 3950X is minimal.
Out of the box the 3950X lags behind quite a bit in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The 9900KS is 18% faster when comparing 1% low performance and 12% faster for the average frame rate. The tuned memory doesn’t improve performance for the 9900KS but it does enable an 8 to 14% performance uplift for the 3950X and now both CPUs are seen delivering comparable performance.
Very small performance gains are seen in Modern Warfare when running the tuned memory and both CPUs delivered virtually identical performance. The 3950X did provide slightly better 1% low performance, though the margins are so small there’s simply no chance you’ll notice the difference when gaming.
Last up we have Shadow of the Tomb Raider and here the 3950X saw a massive 21% increase in 1% low performance with the tuned memory and a 17% increase for the average frame rate. Meanwhile, Intel saw no improvement in 1% low performance and just a 6% increase for the average frame rate. This means while the 9900KS was 11% faster out of the box, with the tuned memory the 3950X just managed to hit the lead.
The results seemed to be a bit all over the place, sometimes the tuned memory provided strong gains, other times those gains were mild and just as often we saw no gains at all. What did seem clear was the marginal performance difference between the Ryzen 9 3950X and Core i9-9900KS for gaming. To get a better sense of that let’s check out the performance across all titles...
Out of the box the 3950X was found to be 6% slower on average when compared to the 9900KS, exactly the same margin seen between the 3900X and 9900K when using the slower DDR4-3200 memory (data from a previous review). Then with the tuned memory the 3950X was 4% slower on average which for all practical purposes is virtually an identical gaming experience in all modern titles.
Here’s a closer look at the performance difference on a per game basis, stock the 9900KS was 7% faster which as we just saw meant the 3950X was 6% slower. Out of the box the bigger wins for the 9900KS were seen in Hitman 2, The Division 2, Metro Exodus, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Fortnite.
Now with both CPUs utilizing the tuned memory timings the 9900KS was just 4% faster on average and this time it’s World of Tanks, Metro Exodus and Hitman where Intel sees its biggest wins. We see a big change for Shadow of the Tomb Raider, so let’s take a closer look at the gains Ryzen received from the tuned memory.
Across the 18 games we tested, the 3950X saw a relatively minor 6% performance improvement on average from the tuned DDR4 memory. The only double digit gains were seen when benchmarking Hitman 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, that’s about it. Moreover, just half the games tested saw less than a 5% performance increase with the faster memory.
There you have it, if you've ever seen or become part of a discussion involving tuned memory and today's mainstream flagship CPUs, the Ryzen 9 3950X and Core i9-9900KS (or the regular 9900K), these benchmarks comparing stock and tuned gaming performance should give you plenty of arguments.
The stock results were impressive on their own with the Trident Z Neo memory. If you were using memory with looser timings and more headroom for tuning, at least relative to the out of the box timings, then the gains would be more extreme. As we noted earlier, if you’re spending over $500 on your CPU and presumably $1,000 or so on the GPU, then springing for premium DDR4 memory probably isn’t a stretch.
But if you are buying a more affordable CPU such as the Ryzen 9 3900X or even one of the Ryzen 7 models, what we’ve found is that you don’t need to invest in premium DDR4 memory. We confirmed this in our 3rd-gen Ryzen DDR4 memory scaling benchmark. Then we used realistic gaming conditions (not 1080p with an RTX 2080 Ti) and the improved memory performance had little to no impact on frame rates.
This testing also confirms the Core i9-9900K remains a top gaming CPU and the fastest for the price. However, we wouldn't call it the ultimate solution simply because it doesn’t hold the performance crown by a significant margin.
When compared to the 3900X which costs about the same, it’s ~5% faster on average for gaming, but the Ryzen 9 comes with a cooler and it’s miles faster in core heavy applications, anywhere from 20 to 60% faster. We also believe the extra cores will future proof the Ryzen better, but that’s probably less of a concern for those buying now as you’ll likely upgrade in 3 to 4 year's time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The first Nokia-branded smart TV launches tomorrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gadgets 360 reports that the Nokia television boasts a 55-inch 4K screen (16:9) with a 60Hz refresh rate and an Android-based operating system. Its sound quality could be the TV’s biggest draw as it features JBL audio tech and 24-watt speakers.
Other specs include support for Dolby Vision and HDR10, Bluetooth 5.0, three HDMI ports, and two USB ports. You also get 2.25GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage.
“Flipkart’s understanding of the needs and behaviors of Indian consumers, and the power of its reach, will help it make Nokia branded smart TVs accessible and affordable,” said Vipul Mehrotra, Flipkart’s VP of Nokia brand partnerships.
The TV will sell for 41,999 Rupees, which is about $590, through Flipkart beginning tomorrow (December 10). It comes with a bundled stand, wall mount, and Bluetooth remote that supports Google Assistant, all of which make it sound like pretty good value. Sadly, there’s no word on if the TV will launch internationally.
Flipkart added that more Nokia-branded TVs would arrive in the future.
This isn’t the first TV to come from Nokia. During its heyday in the 1990s, the company produced both monitors and televisions.
In its more familiar phone market, we recommended the Nokia 6.2 as one of the best budget phones in our Best of Smartphones feature.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Robotics Researchers Have A Duty To Prevent Autonomous Weapons</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Robotics is rapidly being transformed by advances in artificial intelligence. And the benefits are widespread: We are seeing safer vehicles with the ability to automatically brake in an emergency, robotic arms transforming factory lines that were once offshored and new robots that can do everything from shop for groceries to deliver prescription drugs to people who have trouble doing it themselves.
But our ever-growing appetite for intelligent, autonomous machines poses a host of ethical challenges.
These ideas and more were swirling as my colleagues and I met in early November at one of the world’s largest autonomous robotics-focused research conferences – the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. There, academics, corporate researchers, and government scientists presented developments in algorithms that allow robots to make their own decisions.
As with all technology, the range of future uses for our research is difficult to imagine. It’s even more challenging to forecast given how quickly this field is changing. Take, for example, the ability for a computer to identify objects in an image: in 2010, the state of the art was successful only about half of the time, and it was stuck there for years. Today, though, the best algorithms as shown in published papers are now at 86% accuracy. That advance alone allows autonomous robots to understand what they are seeing through the camera lenses. It also shows the rapid pace of progress over the past decade due to developments in AI.
This kind of improvement is a true milestone from a technical perspective. Whereas in the past manually reviewing troves of video footage would require an incredible number of hours, now such data can be rapidly and accurately parsed by a computer program.
But it also gives rise to an ethical dilemma. In removing humans from the process, the assumptions that underpin the decisions related to privacy and security have been fundamentally altered. For example, the use of cameras in public streets may have raised privacy concerns 15 or 20 years ago, but adding accurate facial recognition technology dramatically alters those privacy implications.
When developing machines that can make own decisions – typically called autonomous systems – the ethical questions that arise are arguably more concerning than those in object recognition. AI-enhanced autonomy is developing so rapidly that capabilities which were once limited to highly engineered systems are now available to anyone with a household toolbox and some computer experience.
People with no background in computer science can learn some of the most state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tools, and robots are more than willing to let you run your newly acquired machine learning techniques on them. There are online forums filled with people eager to help anyone learn how to do this.
With earlier tools, it was already easy enough to program your minimally modified drone to identify a red bag and follow it. More recent object detection technology unlocks the ability to track a range of things that resemble more than 9,000 different object types. Combined with newer, more maneuverable drones, it’s not hard to imagine how easily they could be equipped with weapons. What’s to stop someone from strapping an explosive or another weapon to a drone equipped with this technology?
Using a variety of techniques, autonomous drones are already a threat. They have been caught dropping explosives on U.S. troops, shutting down airports and being used in an assassination attempt on Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The autonomous systems that are being developed right now could make staging such attacks easier and more devastating.
About a year ago, a group of researchers in artificial intelligence and autonomous robotics put forward a pledge to refrain from developing lethal autonomous weapons. They defined lethal autonomous weapons as platforms that are capable of “selecting and engaging targets without human intervention.” As a robotics researcher who isn’t interested in developing autonomous targeting techniques, I felt that the pledge missed the crux of the danger. It glossed over important ethical questions that need to be addressed, especially those at the broad intersection of drone applications that could be either benign or violent.
For one, the researchers, companies and developers who wrote the papers and built the software and devices generally aren’t doing it to create weapons. However, they might inadvertently enable others, with minimal expertise, to create such weapons.
What can we do to address this risk?
Regulation is one option, and one already used by banning aerial drones near airports or around national parks. Those are helpful, but they don’t prevent the creation of weaponized drones. Traditional weapons regulations are not a sufficient template, either. They generally tighten controls on the source material or the manufacturing process. That would be nearly impossible with autonomous systems, where the source materials are widely shared computer code and the manufacturing process can take place at home using off-the-shelf components.
Another option would be to follow in the footsteps of biologists. In 1975, they held a conference on the potential hazards of recombinant DNA at Asilomar in California. There, experts agreed to voluntary guidelines that would direct the course of future work. For autonomous systems, such an outcome seems unlikely at this point. Many research projects that could be used in the development of weapons also have peaceful and incredibly useful outcomes.
A third choice would be to establish self-governance bodies at the organization level, such as the institutional review boards that currently oversee studies on human subjects at companies, universities and government labs. These boards consider the benefits to the populations involved in the research and craft ways to mitigate potential harms. But they can regulate only research done within their institutions, which limits their scope.
Still, a large number of researchers would fall under these boards’ purview – within the autonomous robotics research community, nearly every presenter at technical conferences are members of an institution. Research review boards would be a first step toward self-regulation and could flag projects that could be weaponized.
Many of my colleagues and I are excited to develop the next generation of autonomous systems. I feel that the potential for good is too promising to ignore. But I am also concerned about the risks that new technologies pose, especially if they are exploited by malicious people. Yet with some careful organization and informed conversations today, I believe we can work toward achieving those benefits while limiting the potential for harm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While terms like '3310' and 'Snake' come to mind when Nokia is mentioned, that may be about to change.
The smart phone company is getting into the smart TV game. Well, it's letting its name be slapped on one at the very least.
Indian company Flipkart has secured a licensing deal with Nokia for its new 55-inch smart TV.
It will have a 4K UHD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of max brightness, Dolby vision and HDR10 support, two 24-watt JBL by Harman speakers, 16GB on-board storage, a quad-core processor, three HDMI ports, two USB-ports, Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity.
It will also run an Android 9 operating system with access to Google Play.
"The first-ever Nokia branded Smart TV with Sound by JBL is powered by 24 Watt built-in speakers, DTS TruSurround and Dolby Audio to enhance the overall audio experience at home," Flipkart said in a statement. "This feature addresses a major pain point among Indian consumers, many of whom except a better sound quality from their televisions today."
According to Gadgets 360, Flipkart has stated that its looking to sell more Nokia-branded TVs in the future, though there are no details as yet. We are also unsure if we will ever see them in Australia, though it seems unlikely.
The Nokia 55 Inch Ultra HD TV (4K) will launch in India on December 10 and will have an RRP of 41,999 Indian rupees, which is about $862.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TikTok To Pay $2 Million To Settle Lawsuit Alleging It Collected And Exposed Children's Data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have agreed to pay $US1.1 ($2) million to settle a proposed class action alleging that the app Musical.ly violated children’s privacy laws by collecting their data and operating the app “in a reckless and unlawful manner for commercial gain.”
Earlier this week, a spokesperson for TikTok said that a resolution to the complaint “should be announced soon.” On Friday, the spokesperson said the company had been “made aware of the complaint some time ago” and confirmed a settlement had been reached.
“TikTok is firmly committed to safeguarding the data of its users, especially our younger users,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Although we disagree with much of what is alleged in the complaint, we have been working with the parties involved and are pleased to have come to a resolution of the issues.”
The resolution comes just days after the complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by the legal guardians of two minor children identified only by their initials. It alleged that Musical.ly—which was acquired by ByteDance 2017 and later rebranded as TikTok— “surreptitiously tracked, collected, and disclosed the personally identifiable information and/or viewing data … of minor children, and then sold that data to third-party advertisers so they could, in turn, market their products and services” on the app.
The suit further alleged that the app not only failed to put in place safeguards to prevent the use of the app by minors but also failed to take adequate measures to protect children’s data. Moreover, most privacy features on the app were disabled by default. The complaint stated that failing to protect kids’ information presented “serious ramifications, including, but not limited to, children being stalked on-line by adults.”
Musical.ly required users to share input an email address, phone number, username, first and last name, short bio, and a profile picture to create an account. Because both children named in the suit were under 13 at the time they used the app, the complaint argued that Musical.ly’s alleged conduct violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)—which prevents apps and websites targeted to children from obtaining personally identifiable data of kids under 13 without first seeking permission from their parents—among other U.S. laws.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission settled with TikTok for $US5.7 ($8) million over allegations that Musical.ly violated COPPA, a resolution that FTC Chairman Joe Simons described in a statement at the time as a “record penalty.” As part of this new settlement, TikTok has agreed to pay an all-cash total of $US1.1 ($2) million to the settlement class.

As part of this new settlement, TikTok has agreed to pay an all-cash total of $US1.1 ($2) million to the settlement class, which includes any individual who used or signed up for Musical.ly or TikTok when they were younger than 13 as well as their legal guardians. The exact size settlement class is uncertain but is estimated to include roughly 6 million members.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Reportedly Has Some Major Camera Upgrades Planned For The Galaxy S11</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost a year ago, Samsung acquired mobile camera developer Corephotonics, and now, if reports are true, Samsung might finally be ready to add some of the company’s fancy new photography tech on the upcoming Galaxy S11.
According to a story from Bloomberg, in addition to a super high-res 108-MP sensor, the Galaxy S11 will get two additional cameras in the form of a 5x optical zoom cam and a 3D time-of-flight camera.
That means when you tack on the wide and ultra-wide angle lenses found on the current Galaxy S10, the Galaxy S11 could have a total of four rear cameras, with some rumours suggesting Samsung could go as high as five.
While other phones like Huawei’s P30 Pro and Oppo’s Reno 10x Zoom have sported 5x optical zoom lens before, none of them have readily been available in the U.S., which would give Samsung a significant advantage over competing phones from Apple, Google, and others.
Bloomberg also says the Galaxy S11 won’t be the only Samsung phone to get a massive 5x optical zoom, as it seems Samsung’s next foldable phone (which Samsung teased earlier this spring at its annual developer conference) will also get the same zoom camera as well. And with some reports claiming that Samsung’s second foldable phone could cost as little as $1,250, choosing between the Galaxy S11 and the Galaxy Fold 2 (or whatever Samsung ends up calling it) might actually be a somewhat difficult decision.
However, for anyone concerned about the Galaxy S11's looking a bit awkward like it’s been depicted in early fan renders (created by @onleaks and cashkaro.com), it’s still a bit too early to be really concerned. Noted Samsung leaker Ice Universe claims the final Galaxy S11 will look much nicer, though it doesn’t seem like there’s any way for Samsung to avoid that huge rectangular camera module.
Furthermore, if we look back to previous rumours claiming that the Galaxy S11 could get a 144Hz display, 5G support, and a massive 5,000 mAh battery life, we could be looking at one of the most impressive Galaxy phone launches in recent history.
But who knows, it’s still early, and with the S11 not expected to make its official debut until sometime in late February or early March, nothing is set in stone just yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I Want That On A T-Shirt</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Artists on Twitter say that their work is regularly stolen by armies of bots that generate t-shirts from popular designs—and they’ve got the receipts to prove it.
Here’s the scam: Bots linked to popular t-shirt sales platforms appear to be crawling Twitter for replies to artists that mention phrases like “I want that on a t-shirt” or “Can I get that on a t-shirt?” Within hours, vendors on popular t-shirt destinations (including Amazon, A&H Merch, Toucan Style, Moteefe and others, according to Medium) then start offering the original work for sale without seeking the artist’s approval, let alone cutting them in on the take.
The only way to have the infringing material removed is for the artist to then contact the platforms and suffer through a slow-moving takedown process. It’s an intractable problem for independent artists who rely on social media platforms for visibility but are having their work stolen en masse.
Painter Rob Schamberger highlighted the issue in a December 1 tweet, writing “Never, ever, EVER respond to someone’s art on Twitter saying you want a shirt with that art. Bot accounts will cue into that and then pirate the artwork. This then becomes a nightmare for the artist to get the bootleg merchandise taken down.”
From there, Twitter user and artist @Hannahdouken came up with an idea: the bots doing the pirating may be able to detect when customers may be interested in purchasing a shirt, but they’re not smart enough to discern what the actual content of the shirt is.
@Hannahdouken asked Twitter users to respond to an image stating “This site sells STOLEN artwork, do NOT buy from them!” saying variations on the phrase “I want this on a shirt.” It worked...
... after which all hell broke loose, with Twitter users escalating the prank to include terrible memes and intellectual property belonging to the infamously tight-fisted Disney Corporation, like Mickey Mouse. Multiple stores almost immediately ran shirts saying things like “Not licensed by the Walt Disney Company / This is NOT a parody! We committed copyright infringement and want to be sued by Disney. We pay ALL court and tribunal fees.”
Another Twitter user was able to trick one of the stores into running a shirt with a picture of Mickey Mouse saying “China must be held accountable for its crimes against Uighur Muslims! Just ask me, Mickey Mouse! IP of the Disney corporation! Ha-ha!”
Other stores ran shirts with the logos of Disney, Amazon, Google, Coca-Cola, Walmart and Apple surrounding the phrase “Summoning circle for legal action,” while another shirt with Nintendo’s Mario and Mickey Mouse behind the phrase “Copyright infringement” also made it onto online stores. Another ran a drawing of a cat’s butthole under the description “exclusive edition.”
This is, to an extent, emblematic of the way marketplace platforms have enabled scammers to mass-market fraudulent goods with relative ease—prior reporting has shown that Amazon, for example, is flooded with stolen artwork that it is slow to take down or sometimes never does. Such theft is also reportedly rampant on Instagram. Amazon also has a counterfeiting epidemic, that has persisted despite what the company says is hundreds of millions of dollars in efforts to fight it.
The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development estimated earlier this year that as much as 3.3 per cent ($863 billion) of merchandise sold worldwide is counterfeit, fuelled largely by online sales.
While massive corporations like Disney have the means to fight IP theft, independent creators usually don’t. And on the other side, copyright takedown systems in use at major platforms like YouTube often strike down media protected by fair use laws while leaving creators vulnerable to blackmail via bogus copyright claims.
Efforts to fix this system, such as the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2019 (CASE Act), could open the doors to an even more punitive copyright system that enables more copyright trolling. The whole thing is a mess.
“If you’re an artist and your designs get stolen its extremely frustrating, since the whole process is so automated and quick there’s few things to prevent this, and the process of getting these shops to remove your work is so frustrating and doesn’t stop them from doing it again,” @Hannahdouken told Gizmodo via Twitter DM. “The shirts they sell are extremely cheap as well, so people probably feel more inclined to buy it and less likely to check on the legitimacy of sites, instead of buying from an artists store where they actually get a cut.”
Many of the shirts have since been taken down after either vendors or platforms caught on; Amazon didn’t return Gizmodo’s request for comment, while the Daily Dot reported neither did “several of the offending companies.”
“I’m not sure if this can be stopped at all,” they added. “Even if Disney etc would get involved, they will probably just remove all the designs with trademarked characters on them while the people running the sites promise not to do it again, continuing to steal art from much smaller and vulnerable creators.”
@Hannahdouken recommended that customers think twice before purchasing art from an online t-shirt vendor to make sure their dollars are actually going to independent creators who need it.
“Do some reverse google image searching just to make sure,” they told Gizmodo. “Avoid the shops that are known for doing these shady practices, spread the word about which ones you can’t trust, and follow and support individual artists.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chinese authorities plan to ditch all foreign-made tech by 2023</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHINA HAS DEMANDED that all foreign computer equipment and software be stripped out from government and public offices by the end of 2022.
The move, reported by the Financial Times, adds a new layer of permafrost to the ongoing spat between the US and China. It comes after the White House added several Chinese companies to its "Entity List" of firms considered to be a national security risk and therefore excluded from trading with American companies, without a specific licence.
The FT estimates that 20 to 30 million pieces of equipment would need replacing, with the bulk of the work happening in 2021.
This is far from the first time that China has threatened to boycott Western tech. Around the time of Windows 8, Chinese TV News carried a prime time report claiming that the operating system was "spyware".
Around the same time, the country announced a process of "Dewindowsifying" (its words), with plans to move to a homegrown Linux variant. That plan was abandoned after Microsoft agreed to produce a special edition of Windows for the country that complied with local laws - and you can draw your own conclusions as to what that means.
It's not clear how strict the Chinese authorities plan to be. For example, Lenovo is a Chinese company, but the chips come from Intel, which is American.
One option could be to create special edition machines using Huawei's Kirin chips instead of Intel or AMD, but that's just our little theory.
Although this is the first tangible evidence of China sanctioning Western technology since the Entity List shenanigans began, it doesn't seem to be aimed at the US specifically, but rather is part of ongoing self-sufficiency drives in the country, and in fact, was going to happen at some point anyway.
That being the case, if the idea wasn't to annoy Baby Trump, the timing of this move couldn't be much worse. But that's a big 'if'.  μ

    <h5 class="mb-1">It's the end of the road for Google Glass Explorer Edition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF RISK in being an explorer, as Wikipedia grimly documents. Perhaps with hindsight, the words "Explorer Edition" that featured prominently on the first generation of Google Glass should have warned of a similarly disappointing end.
Google plans to put out one final software update and then to cut all those Explorers loose. And it's less of a last hoorah and more a last wah-wah. 
The update simply lets you pair Glass with the phone, as MyGlass will stop working. Bluetooth will continue, as will the ability to creepily take photos and videos via your lenses. 
People who refuse to apply the update will still be able to use it for the time being, but mirrored apps such as Gmail, YouTube and Hangouts won't work. But really, how dedicated to Google do you have to be to be using Hangouts on your Glass in 2019?
That's true for the next two months, afterwards, you really need the patch. "After February 25, 2020, this update removes the need and ability to use your Google account on Glass," Google writes. 
You'll be able to apply the update at that point, but it won't be around forever. "After February 25, 2020, if you're not logged into the device, or you log out, you will need to install the final update in order to continue using the device," Google says, noting that it only promises to keep the update available until 25 February 2022. 
It's all a bit of a sad end for early adopters - who eventually became plain old "adopters" as Glass never got a commercial release. Let's not forget that they paid $1,500 for the privilege back in 2014. 
Still, if you're a Glass owner that's mourning the demise of the tech, rather than burning $1,500 for no clear reason, the future remains bright-ish for AR glasses. Not only is the Enterprise Edition of Google Glass still alive, but both Qualcomm and Apple seem to have learned nothing from this cautionary tale. 
Look forward to us lamenting their failures at some point in 2028. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft starts forcing Windows 10 1809 stragglers to upgrade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MODERNIST SOFTWARE HOUSE Microsoft has begun pushing mandatory updates of its Windows 10 operating system to customers who are straggling.
Microsoft policy introduced earlier this year says that users can defer updates using whatever tools they see fit for a year after release. After that, they'll start to lose their right to choose.
The reasons are fairly sound - it prevents unnecessary fragmentation of the operating system, and more importantly, it ensures that users have all the latest security features and patches.
This is the same process it followed earlier this year ahead of Build 1803 (Spring 2018 Update) going end-of-life, in accordance with a policy of only having two ‘stable' builds being supported at the same time.
Says Microsoft: "Beginning today, we will slowly start the phased process to automatically initiate a feature update for devices running the October 2018 Update (Windows 10, version 1809) Home and Pro editions, keeping those devices supported and receiving the monthly updates that are critical to device security and ecosystem health.
"We are starting this rollout process several months in advance of the end of service date to provide adequate time for a smooth update process."
Long story short, Microsoft is getting ahead of the game. Although Build 1809 (yes, that 1809) won't reach end-of-life until next May, by pushing the Windows 10 November Update now, it hopes to avoid problems with stragglers who may as well be using Windows Vista once the support runs out.
Microsoft still allows you to defer non-essential updates for up to two months in total, before the nagging kicks in again.
If you need evidence that this is the way of things to come, you only need look at the current Build 1909 - fail to update to it, and you'll be forced to, come next summer.
Although 1909 has been largely free of errors (relatively) some users have complained that a few familiar gremlins have crept in again - most notably, the search box which has been borking for several builds running now. μ

    <h5 class="mb-1">FTC confirms Cambridge Analytica were wrong'uns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YOU MAY WANT to sit down before you read this. It turns out Cambridge Analytica - the company that turned mundane Facebook data into electoral gold (or at least bronze) before exploding in a fire of righteous outrage from privacy activists - weren't entirely above board.
The Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) has compiled its verdict on the company, and it's a unanimous and damning one: "The data analytics and consulting company Cambridge Analytica, LLC engaged in deceptive practices to harvest personal information from tens of millions of Facebook users for voter profiling and targeting." 
That may sound mild, but in FTC verdict terms, it's a glove slap to the face.   
Additionally, the FTC found that Cambridge Analytica was deceptive in its participation in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, which legally allows data to cross the Atlantic. Not only did it allow its certification to lapse, but it "failed to adhere to the Privacy Shield requirement that companies that cease participation in the Privacy Shield affirm to the Department of Commerce." We're shocked. Shocked.
So what does this mean then? In practical terms, very little. Firstly, Cambridge Analytica is forbidden from misrepresenting the privacy and confidentiality it provides for its data. With the best will in the world, that ship has not only already sailed, but subsequently sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
Secondly, the organisation is prevented from participating in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework. But given the company shut up shop last year, it wasn't exactly planning on doing so anyway.
"In addition, the company is required to continue to apply Privacy Shield protections to personal information it collected while participating in the program (or to provide other protections authorised by law), or return or delete the information," the verdict concludes. "It also must delete the personal information that it collected through the GSRApp."
Between this and the $5bn fine imposed on Facebook for its various privacy snafus, Mark Zuckerberg will be hoping this finally turns the page on the worst chapter in Facebook's short history. We can't wait to see what horrors lurk in the next one… µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">More than half of NHS devices are still running Windows 7</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NHS TRUSTS are still running Microsoft's soon-to-be-defunct Windows 7 operating system on more than 20,000 devices.
That's according to cloud computing firm Citrix, which obtained the information through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. The request was sent to 98 NHS Trusts across the UK, of which 77 responded. 
As per the FoI, 52 per cent of the total 447,000+ devices being used in the NHS, including desktops, laptops, and tablets, are still running Windows 7, which reaches end-of-life status on 14 January 2020. 
That's despite the fact that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) last year announced a £150m plan to upgrade all NHS systems to Windows 10 by the time that Windows 7 reaches the digital graveyard. However, it's worth noting that the NHS is an E5 licence holder, which means it'll get an extra year of Windows 7 support for free. 
Back to the FoI, and 78 per cent of NHS organisations say they are currently working to migrate their systems to Windows 10 within the next six months, and a further six per cent of Trusts are considering migrating in the near future.
23 per cent of the trusts responding to the FoI request said 10 or more applications they use on their systems still need remediation to ensure ease of use and stability when moving to Windows 10.
Fewer than a quarter (23 per cent) said they had already deployed or were planning to deploy cloud or virtualisation technology to help migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The use of these technologies will help NHS Trusts in centralising the management of desktop environments, thereby leading to a more efficient and cost-effective migration.
"The NHS is unquestionably dedicated to delivering first-class patient services," said Matt Smith, Director, Public Sector, UK & Ireland, Citrix.
"Yet prolonged austerity is putting it under even more pressure to do more with less.
"Given the additional security considerations that come with outdated technology, migrating to Windows 10 within the 'next six months' could be too little, too late. Ensuring IT infrastructure is up-to-date and secure is necessary to both better support NHS staff in their day-to-day jobs and ensure first-class healthcare services in the UK."
While the use of Window 7 in such large numbers across the NHS worrying, it's made huge strides since July, when the Department of Health and Social Care revealed that over 1 million NHS computers were still using Windows 7. At the same time, it fessed that NHS Trusts are still using more than 2,000 PCs running Microsoft's long-defunct Windows XP OS. µ

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GOOD NEWS MONEYBAGS-MAC FANS, the cheese grater inspired Mac Pro is going to be available to order from Tuesday, according to an email that's been going out to interested parties.
If you're unaware of the Mac Pro's imminent arrival and haven't been saving up, you may want to move along now. As you can see in the tweet below, the email was extremely light on details, but we already know what the entry-level Mac Pro will set you back: $5,999, or around £4,557 if you're on this side of the Atlantic. 
Again, that's the entry-level Mac Pro, although the term is pretty relative given the basic model packs an eight-core Xeon processor, 32GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and a Radeon Pro 580X graphics card. Expect to easily clear five figures for the fully upgraded version with a 28-core processor and 1.5TB of RAM. 
Maybe ask Calvin Harris if his is any good before you put in that pre-order.
If you're sucking air through your teeth at this point, you may want to look away now, because while Apple also promised the Pro Display XDR will be available to order at the same time, it's even weaker value. The 32in display may pack a 6K resolution with 1,000,000:1 contrast, but it'll also sell for $4,999 (around £3,797) with an extra $1,000 if you want the fancy anti-glare nano-texture coating. 
The real cherry on the cake is the $999 Apple wants you to pay for a stand, though. We'll just rest it in the corner of the room, thanks. Yes, there used to be a chair there, but we sold it to pay for the Mac.
You never know - maybe Apple will feel generous with its dollar-to-pound conversions. Though if we were to give you odds on that, it'd be close to that contrast ratio we mentioned above. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy S11 specs, release date and price: In-the-wild images show chunky camera hump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WE'RE STILL MONTHS AWAY from the arrival of Galaxy S11, but it's already shaping up to be one of Samsung's most interesting flagships yet.
Speculation suggests the S11 lineup, comprising the Galaxy S11e, Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+, will up the ante in the screen department with larger SAMOLED 120Hz displays, and in the camera stakes with a mammoth 108MP main sensor. There's also talk that the handset true will boast souped-up internals, an all-new facial recognition system and baked-in 5G support. 
We've rounded up everything we know about Samsung's Galaxy S11 lineup below. 
Release date and priceAs per unsurprising rumours, the Galaxy S11 lineup will debut in "mid to late February", suggesting a pre-MWC launch is likely on the cards. 
There's no word on pricing yet, but if anything like last year's Galaxy S10, expect the so-called S11e, S11 and S10+ to fetch £699, £799 and £899, respectively. 
Latest news9/12/19: The Galaxy S11 has made its in-the-wild debut, courtesy of tipster Ice Universe who has shared the first images of the flagship in the flesh.
Though the images aren't the, er, clearest, they show the Galaxy S11's rear camera hump, which will allegedly add 1.1mm of thickness to the device - hardly surprising given rumours that it'll sport a 108MP primary camera and a periscope-style telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom.
6/12/19:  Samsung is planning a major overhaul of the Galaxy S11's camera in a bid to better compete with the iPhone, Bloombergreports. Adding weight to previous rumours, the report - citing the usual sources familiar with the matter - says the Galaxy S11 will sport the Samsung-made 108MP sensor that recently appeared on Xiaomi's CC9 Pro. This will reportedly be accompanied by three other lenses including ultrawide-angle and Time of Flight (Tof) sensors. 
Separately, SamMobile is reporting that the highest-end Galaxy S11+ could sport a mammoth 5,000mAh battery, a huge improvement over the 4,100mAh battery inside this year's 4,100mAh offering. 
5/12/19: There's yet more evidence that the Galaxy S11 will be capable of capturing 8K video, as SamMobile is reporting that its sources have "confirmed" the feature for Samsung's next flagship. This is hardly surprising, as Samsung's Exynos 990 processor supports 8K video capture at 30 frames-per-second, and it's likely Qualcomm's newly-announced Snapdragon 865 - which will power S11 handsets in the US - will also support the feature. 
2/12/19: Tipster Ice Universe has shared an image of an alleged Galaxy S11 screen protector, which hints that the handset will boast a tiny punch-hole cutout and barely-there bezels.
The image (above) shows that the front-facing camera will be placed at the top centre of the display, as seen on the Galaxy Note 10. It also confirms, if legit, that the Galaxy S11 will have little in the way of screen surroundings; there's virtually no bezel at the top and sides and a tiny chin underneath the display.
27/11/19: The Galaxy S11+ has shown up in official-looking renders, just days after it appeared on Geekbench. The image (above), courtesy of CashKaro and @OnLeaks, show that the S11+ will look similar to its smaller S11 and S11e siblings with a curved edge display, centrally-aligned punch-hole and a USB-C port at the bottom. 
 
Elsewhere, the report claims the Galaxy S11+ will sport a 6.9in Dynamic OLED screen with an under-display fingerprint sensor and will measure in at 8.8mm thick. 
25/11/19: The first benchmark results for the Galaxy S11 5G have appeared on Geekbench
The listing for the handset confirms that the flagship will pack Samsung's new octa-core Exynos 990 SoC running at 1.95GHz; US-bound variants of the device will likely pack Qualcomm's incoming Snapdragon 865 chipset. While that all sounds well and good, the benchmark scores - 447 in single-core and 2,326 in multi-core performance - are somewhat disappointing; the iPhone 11, for example, scored 1,333 and 3,251 on Geekbench, and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 10 scored 736 and 2,691. 
22/11/19: A filing at China's 3C certification agency, spied by DroidShout, has all but confirmed that there will be a 5G variant of the Galaxy S11. It's not all good news though, as the listing - which references the devices as the SM-G9860 - reveals that the 5G model will ship with 25W fast charging support. While that's an upgrade over the 15W charging offered with the Galaxy S10, it's lacking compared to the 45W charging offered by the Note 10+. 
21/11/19: Samsung has inadvertently revealed another key feature of the Galaxy S11, as in its newly-released One UI beta for the Galaxy Note 9, eagle-eyed users have spotted references to a 120Hz display.
As per Ice Universe (above), a new mode in Samsung's software will allow users to switch between a 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rate, while a third mode will allow for the screen to switch automatically between 60Hz and 120Hz.
 20/11/19: Samsung has pushed out a new version of its Camera app and inadvertently revealed some clues about the Galaxy S11.
As spied by XDA Developers, the latest version of the app has references to 8K video recording - a feature also supported by Samsung's Exynos 9980 SoC. The chipset, which is expected to power US variants of Samsung's next flagship, will feature 8K@30fps video decoding/encoding capabilities. 
If 8K support is included, the 12MP camera found on the Galaxy S10 ain't going to cut it. Handily, the updated Camera app also includes references to 108MP photos, adding yet more weight to the rumours that the handset will sport Samsung's yet-to-be-announced, second-generation 108MP camera sensor. 
Another bit of code inside the app makes reference to a 20:9 aspect ratio display, possible confirmation that the S11 will ditch the 19:9 screen found on Samsung's Galaxy S10 handsets. 
10/11/19: Evan Blass has spilled some details about the S11 lineup, claiming the flagship will launch in three different sizes.
In a tweet, Blass says that the Galaxy S11 will comprise 6.4in (S11e), 6.7in (S11) and 6.9in (S11+) variants; by comparison, the S10e, S10 and S10+ ship with 5.8in, 6.1in and 6.4in screens, respectively. 
However, in a follow-up message, Blass notes that the smaller model could sport a larger 6.4in display - as large as the screen on the S10 Plus - stating that he's received "conflicting information" about the entry-level model.
The two smaller models will be made available in both 4G and 5G variants, according to Blass, while the top-end Galaxy S11+ will launch with 5G-only. He also notes that all models will have curved-edge displays, marking the end of Samsung's S10e-style flat panels.
Blass claims the Galaxy S11 series will make its debut in "mid to late February", suggesting a pre-MWC launch is likely on the cards.
8/11/19: The Galaxy S11 will allegedly sport a "new" 108MP main camera sensor.
So says Twitter tipster Ice Universe (below), who claims the S11 won't use the 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that Samsung launched earlier this year, but will instead boast an upgraded second-gen sensor. 
It's unclear how the new sensor will improve on the three-month-old lens that's expected to debut on Xiaomi's CC9 Pro and Mi Note 10 smartphones, as though Ice Universe thinks there's a "high possibility" it'll debut on the Galaxy S11, he doesn't share any additional details. 
The first-gen sensor is the smartphone sensor to adopt a 1/1.33-inch size, which means it can absorb more light in low-lit settings than smaller sensors, while its pixel-merging Tetracell technology compresses four pixels into one to produce brighter 27MP images.
It also supports video recording without losses in field-of-view at resolutions up to 6K at 30-frames-per-second.
31/10/19: A new rumour claims Samsung is working on a new facial recognition system that likely will debut on the Galaxy S11 next year.
References to the as-yet-unannounced face recognition system have been spied in Samsung's One UI 2.0 beta by both TechTastic and XDA's Max Winebach (below), who spotted references to "FaceService" for the Picasso - the codename for the Galaxy S11.   
Though current flagship Samsung devices feature facial recognition, this leak suggests the company is working on a souped-up version based on 3D rather than 2D in order to make it more accurate and secure like the Face ID and Face Unlock tech found on the iPhone and Pixel 4, respectively.
Samsung, naturally, hasn't commented on the leak, but given the recent issues surrounding the fingerprint scanners on its Galaxy devices, a shift to face recognition would certainly make sense for the company.
30/10/10: We're likely still months away from the official unveiling of the Galaxy S11, but the first rumours are starting to crop up.
Following the leak that it'll likely launch on 18 February (below), we're now hearing that the Galaxy S11 will be powered by Qualcomm and Samsung's as-yet-unannounced Snapdragon 865 and Exynos 9830 processors, respectively. 
This somewhat unsurprising information - though some rumours had pointed to Samsung's new Exynos 980 SoC powering the Galaxy S11 lineup - was uncovered in a OneUI 2.0 beta by XDA's Max Weinbach. 
The Snapdragon 865, which will likely be unveiled in December at Qualcomm's annual Tech Summit, will reportedly be based on the 7nm EUV-based fabrication process and leaked benchmarks peg it as an octa-core SoC with a base frequency of 1.8GHz.
Samsung's Exynos 9830 is unlikely to make its debut until next year, but we already know a bit about the chip; rumours claim it'll rely on four Cortex A55 cores for low-performance and four Cortex A77 cores for high-performance.  
Weinbach also found references to three models of the Galaxy S11, at least one of which supports 5G. The One UI beta also includes references to LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.0 storage support.
7/10/19: We don't yet know much about the Samsung Galaxy S11, but we might already know when it will be launching.
A source speaking to SamMobile has claimed that the next-gen Galaxy flagship will make its debut on 18 February, just days before next year's Mobile World Congress kicks off. 
While such a date would make sense - the Galaxy S10 landed on 20 February, and the Galaxy S9 before it on 25 February - even SamMobile is sceptical; it notes that it's "not confident enough in the source of this information to put our weight behind the date provided", so we'd take this early rumour with a hefty pinch of salt.
Beyond this shady leak, there's not much information surrounding the Galaxy S11 yet. There's some chatter that the smartphone will feature the bonkers 108MP camera sensor that Samsung showed off earlier this year, and SamMobile notes that it'll likely ship with One UI 2.1 and up to 1TB of internal storage. 
There's also a "very good chance" the Galaxy S10 will somewhat inevitably follow in the footsteps of the Note 10 and ditch the line-up's long-standing headphone jack in favour of USB-C.
If we were to put our speculative hat on, we'd also assume the Galaxy S11 will pack Qualcomm's next-generation Snapdragon 865 SoC, 5G support, a punch-hole display with baked-in fingerprint scanner and triple rear-mounted camera setup. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">TikTok settles child data class-action one day after lawsuit was filed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VINE WANNABE TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have agreed to cough up $1.1m (£835,000) to settle a lawsuit related to its "reckless" collection of children's data. 
The proposed class-action, filed just last week, alleged that TikTok violated privacy laws by collecting data on underage users "in a reckless and unlawful manner" back when it was known as Musical.ly. 
Under the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), social media companies are explicitly barred from storing data of children under the age of 13 without express parental consent.
However, Musical.ly requested that anyone under the age of 13 creating an account handed over personal information including name, phone number, email address, photo, and bio that information would be publicly available for other users to see.
The complaint also alleges that the app collected the location data of its users, including minors, between December 2015 and October 2016.
"[Musical.ly] surreptitiously tracked, collected, and disclosed the personally identifiable information and/or viewing data … of minor children, and then sold that data to third-party advertisers so they could, in turn, market their products and services," the complaint alleged. 
In a statement, TikTok - which was last week dubbed a "potential threat" by the FBI - confirmed it had reached a settlement: "TikTok is firmly committed to safeguarding the data of its users, especially our younger users.
"Although we disagree with much of what is alleged in the complaint, we have been working with the parties involved and are pleased to have come to a resolution of the issues."
This isn't the first time TikTok has been forced to pay for privacy violations. Earlier this year, the FTC reached a $5.7m (£4.3m) settlement with TikTok over COPPA violations.
At the time, FTC Chairman Joe Simons said that the company "knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13." μ

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus 8 Lite leak hints at a return to the mid-range</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LEAKED RENDERS of the so-called OnePlus 8 Lite (below) have all but confirmed that the firm is plotting a return to the mid-range market.
The handset, which could be the company's first mid-range device since 2015's OnePlus X, will arrive in the first half of 2020 alongside the higher-end OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro, according to @OnLeaks and 91Mobiles.
Renders shared by the tipster duo show that the handset will sport a flat "6.4in or 6.4in" display with a centred punch-hole cutout that will house a single selfie cam. Around the back, the OnePlus 8 Lite will sport a dual-camera setup flanked by a bunch of additional sensors, including what could be a Time of Flight (ToF) sensor.
Elsewhere, the OnePlus 8 Lite will sport a single USB-C port and an in-display fingerprint sensor, all-but-confirming that it will feature an OLED screen. 91Mobiles notes that it's as-yet-unclear whether it'll boast the same 90Hz refresh rate as the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro. 
20/11/19: Alleged sketches of the OnePlus 8 Pro have surfaced online, all-but-confirming the flagship's quad-camera setup and punch-hole display. 
The diagrams, obtained by True-Tech, show four camera lenses on the back of the handset, accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash and laser autofocus. The fourth lens is expected to arrive in the form of a depth-sensing Time of Flight (ToF) sensor.
The bare-bones drawings also add weight to the rumours that OnePlus is planning to ditch the pop-up camera mechanism seen on the OnePlus 7 Pro. Instead, the firm looks to be considering a Samsung-esque punch-hole cutout, with the sketches depicting handsets with both single and dual-lens front-facing cameras. 
Elsewhere, not much seems to have changed; the button placements remain identical, with a volume controls positioned on the left of the screen and the alert slider and power button placed on the right-hand side.
12/11/19: In-the-wild images of an alleged OnePlus 8 Pro have surfaced online, adding weight to the rumours of a punch-hole display.
Official-looking renders had previously suggested that OnePlus planned to bin notches and pop-up cameras in favour of a punch-hole display, and images of a supposed OnePlus 8 Pro prototype (below) all but confirms it.  
They show a OnePlus handset sporting a pill-shaped punch-hole cutout that houses two selfie cameras instead of one. 
The blurry snaps also tell us that the OnePlus 8 Pro will be available in a purple variant, similar to that seen on the year-old OnePlus 6T in Thunder Purple, and suggest it'll sport a curved screen similar to that seen on this year's 7T Pro. 
5G support could also be on the cards for the next-gen OnePlus; the images allegedly show "OnePlus 8 Pro 5G" branding on the handset's backside. 
7/11/19: The OnePlus 8 Pro will reportedly up the ante in the screen stakes with an iPhone 12-rivalling 120Hz display.
So says tipster Max J, who tweeted a not-so-cryptic image that mentions '120Hz" alongside the tagline "Be a Pro" (below). While many speculated that he was teasing the incoming Galaxy S11, Max later confirmed that he was referring to the OnePlus 8 Pro.
The tweet doesn't give anything else away, but the accompanying "Be a Pro" message suggests this feature - which will presumably arrive in the form of a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED display - will be reserved for OnePlus' next-gen Pro-branded model, with the standard OnePlus 8 likely to stick to a 90Hz screen.
If the rumour is legit, the OnePlus 8 Pro will be the Chinese firm's first phone to sport a 120Hz screen - though not the first to make it to market; the Asus RoG Phone 2, which debuted in Europe in September, sports a 120Hz OLED display.
Apple is reportedly plotting 120Hz screens for next year's iPhone lineup too. Recent rumours suggested the iPhone 12 will follow in the footsteps of Apple's ProMotion iPad Pros with a 120Hz screen, a significant upgrade over the iPhones' current 60Hz displays. 
5/11/19: OnePlus is reportedly planning to show off its first wearable alongside the OnePlus 8.
After its recent foray into the television space, the company is now gearing up to launch a "fitness wearable", according to a tweet from TechPP writer Tech Auntyji (below). 
The cryptic tweet doesn't tell us much else about the gadget, but its description as a "fitness wearable" suggests it'll arrive as a Fitbit-band style device, rather than an Apple Watch competitor. And given OnePlus' association with Google, the unnamed wearable will likely arrive running Wear OS. 
 
PhoneArena, which has shared early sketches of the so-called OnePlus Watch that the company abandoned in 2016 (above), claims the device will launch alongside the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, which are expected to debut in May 2020. 
18/10/19: We've already caught a glimpse of the OnePlus 8, and now the Pro variant has prematurely surfaced.
The official-looking images (above), shared by OnLeaks and 91Mobiles, show that the OnePlus 8 Pro will ditch the 7T's waterdrop notch and 7T Pro's pop-up camera in favour of a Samsung-style punch-hole cutout in the top left corner of its display.
As per 91Mobiles, this screen will measure in at 6.65in, larger than the 6.5in screen size tipped for the standard OnePlus 8, and it'll unsurprisingly feature a 90Hz refresh rate. 
The renders also suggest that the 8 Pro will be the first OnePlus smartphone to sport a quad-camera setup, comprising three sensors (main, telephoto and wide-angle) alongside a 3D Time of Flight (ToF) sensor. 
Elsewhere, the OnePlus 8 Pro will sport a USB-C port flanked by a redesigned speaker grille, 8GB RAM paired with 128GB storage, and possible 5G support. As per the render, it looks like the device will also be made available in a new mirrored silver finish. 
7/10/19: We're still days away from the launch of the OnePlus 7T Pro, but that hasn't stopped its sequel from appearing online.
That's thanks to OnLeaks and CashKaro, which have joined forces to share images of what they claim are renders of the OnePlus 8 based on schematics from a "company insider." 
The renders show a handset that looks a lot like the OnePlus 7 Pro; there's an almost bezel-free curved display, three cameras positioned vertically on the rear of the device and a familiar blue colour scheme. 
However, unlike the 7 Pro, the renders show that the OnePlus 8 will adopt a punch-hole camera in the top left corner of its 6.5in screen, rather than the pop-up camera of its predecessor.
It'll also feature some changes under the hood, as the leak claims the OnePlus 8 will be the company's first phone to ship with wireless charging. OnePlus has long opted against including this feature, claiming that wireless charging is "inferior" compared to traditional methods.
Given OnePlus' previous comments, it's likely upgraded components are also on the cards; OnLeaks and CashKaro speculate that the OnePlus 8 flagship would be powered by the upcoming Snapdragon 865 SoC, which will be teamed with up to 12GB RAM and 128GB of non-expandable storage. 
5G support will also be included, according to the leak, though this will likely be included only on the OnePlus 8 Pro. 
It'll likely be a while until the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro make their official debut, as the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro were unveiled in May this year.
Still, you won't have to wait that long until a new OnePlus device is unveiled. Following the recent unveiling of the OnePlus 7T, the firm will show off the OnePlus 7T Pro at an event in London on 10 October. This is expected to feature a pop-up selfie cam, triple cameras and an upgraded Snapdragon 855+ CPU. µ

    <h5 class="mb-1">The OnePlus TV just crossed a key milestone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix support is finally coming to these Android-powered TVs. Anyone who already owns a OnePlus TV set should automatically get access to the app once the latest update has been rolled out.
To start you weekend binge, you’ll first need to download the Netflix app from the Play store. Admittedly that’s a tiny bit of a faff – OnePlus has promised that all future models will come with this app pre-installed – but once it’s on your box it should be a lot easier to access your favourite shows and films.

There’s also a new remote to make the viewing process even smoother. The revamped controller comes with a hearty-sized Netflix button, which sits alongside the other Prime Video, YouTube and Google Assistant buttons. Anyone who’s previously invested in a OnePlus TV set can also claim a free controller by heading to the OnePlus site and inputting their TV’s serial number.
This is all good news for anyone who already owns one of the TVs, but there’s still no news on when we can expect the models to make their way overseas and hit UK shores. Currently, you can only track down one of the TVs if you’re in India, where the two main models were released on September 28.
OnePlus is probably best known for its smartphone output, which offer very good specs at very reasonable prices. At present, the company is only selling two variants of the TV model, the OnePlus TV Q1 and the OnePlus TV Q1 Pro.
Related: OnePlus TV – everything we know
Anyone who owns a OnePlus smartphone can enjoy optimised connectivity between their handset and a OnePlus TV, thanks to the OnePlus connect feature. This is a nice little bonus, given that using on-screen TV keyboards is something akin to torture.
But sadly, it looks like we’ll have to wait a little longer for the TVs to arrive in the UK.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi Redmi K30 specs revealed – could it be the next OnePlus killer?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi has teased several enticing new details about its next handset, the Redmi K30. Will it offer premium features on a reasonable budget?
A series of posts on Chinese social network Weibo have revealed what we can expect to see from the Redmi K30, the sequel to the Redmi K20 (known as the Xiaomi Mi 9T in the UK), which was branded the “Flagship Killer 2.0” at launch as a clear dig aimed at the OnePlus 7. With impressive specs such as 5G connectivity and a 64-megapixel camera, can the K30 also aspire to knock flagship phones off their perch?
Related: Best Phones
The K30 will be Redmi’s first-ever 5G phone, although a 4G variant of the device will also be available. The battery will have a 4500mAh capacity with an impressive 30W fast-charging capability. For greater flexibility, the device offers both NFC (enabling actions such as contactless payments), and a 3.5mm headphone jack that means you won’t have to rely on pricey bluetooth headphones.
Related: Best Camera Phones
The camera also looks to be an impressive set up, with the main Sony IMX 686 sensor having a resolution of 64-megapixels. The released image of the rear of the handset (at the top of the page) shows a total of four rear camera lenses, and a dual selfie camera present as a cutout in the screen, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.
Related: Best Android Phones
We’ve got high expectations of this upcoming smartphone, since we were so impressed with the performance of the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro. The snappy performance, great camera, and attractive design helped this high-performing device on its way to an enviable 4.5/5 star rating — but there was still room for improvement, as it lacks some higher-end features such as wireless charging and waterproofing, while the software interface remains imperfect.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Epic Games Store down? Here’s how to fix it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Epic Games have fans have been frustrated and confused, following a bug that prevented players from accessing their store. 
Epic Games have apologised following an issue that saw players stuck on the “preparing the Epic Games Launcher” screen. Here’s how you can get it sorted…
There are a couple of ways to fix this. Firstly, on Windows, you’ll need to exit the Epic Games Launcher completely.
Then, right-click your Epic Games Launcher shortcut and click ‘Properties’. Then at the end of the target line, (this is the field simply marked ‘target’,) add the command line argument -usehyperthreading.
Then the whole target line will look something like this:  “C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Launcher\Portal\Binaries\Win64\EpicGamesLauncher.exe” -usehyperthreading
Epic Games have recommended this as the best fix for the launch issue.
If you’re looking to fix the same issue on Mac, the advice is similar. You’ll need to exit the launcher entirely. Open your Terminal and type: “open /Applications/Epic\ Games\ Launcher.app/ –args -usehyperthreading” and press Enter.
Epic Games said: “If this method resolves the issue, you will probably see a pending update in the settings. Once the client restarts and is patched to the fixed version, then you can remove “-usehyperthreading” from your command line and continue to launch normally.”
There are alternative methods that, again involve leaving the launcher and taking two slightly different routes on Mac or Windows. The image below shows Epic games advice on tackling both scenarios…
So far, these are the only available fixes for the issue. Hopefully another update will turn up soon to rectify the issue, but Epic Games have not been quite as responsive as some gamers had hoped.
One or two fans, (or perhaps ex fans?) took out their frustrations on social media. One called it “by far the worst bug” to have affected their gaming experience and said they’d been struggling for almost two months with the issue.
We haven’t heard from a huge sample of players regarding the issues, but clearly it has been widespread enough for Epic Games to respond. Let us know if you have encountered the issues and if these fixes are working.
The Epic Games Store has been a hit with games developers since launch because it offers them a larger percentage of the revenue generated from their games, compared to the dominant PC games store, Steam. The graph below, from PCworld.com, shows how the Epic Games store has attempted to change the market.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here’s how Apple could squeeze bigger batteries into next year’s iPhones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The iPhone 11 series had very impressive battery life, and this could be set to get even better next year thanks to some cleverly rearranged circuitry.
According to MacRumors, the 2020 range of iPhones may have a battery protection unit that’s up to 50% smaller and thinner than the one found in previous iPhones. This would allow more space for a bigger battery, which may well be a necessity seeing as next year’s iPhones are strongly expected to run demanding 5G connectivity. Furthermore, the report claims that the same battery protection unit, manufactured by ITM, has already been supplied for the manufacture of the Samsung Galaxy S11.

We were pleased by the durability of the batteries in the iPhone 11, which comfortably lasted a day even after heavy usage during testing. One thing we’re less pleased about is the lack of a fast charger supplied in the box, with a measly 5W unit remaining the default. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max made even bigger steps in the right direction, easily outperforming the battery life of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and also packing an 18W charger instead (which is by no means market-leading, but is at least an improvement). Current rumours suggest that upcoming iPhones may ditch the Lightning port altogether in favour of wireless charging.
Related: Best iPhones
We’d come across a few rumours about the battery of the Samsung Galaxy S11 as well, before this latest news. According to what we’ve heard so far, even the smallest model in the range will pack a 4000mAh battery, while the top-spec variant is set to house a 5000mAh capacity cell. This would represent a significant leap forward, bearing in mind that the Samsung Galaxy S10e had just a 3100mAh battery. Specification alone don’t tell you the whole story, so remember to wait for our full reviews to see how these devices stand up to real-world usage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This update is the last you’ll see of Google Glass Explorer Edition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google has announced one final update before it pulls the plug on the Explorer Edition of Google Glass.
The update will disconnect users’ Google accounts from the hardware and remove any connection to Google’s backend services.
While it may sound counter intuitive to push the update to remove features from the device, it could actually be crucial to keeping the glasses running once Google cuts its support.
Bluetooth functionality means users will still be able to pair their Glass with their phone and use the camera and sideloaded apps but Mirror apps, including Gmail, YouTube and Hangouts, will no longer be compatible. The MyGlass app will also cease to function.
Google will end support on February 25 2020 so Glass users will want to jump on this update before this date to keep their devices running smoothly.
Upon visiting Google’s support page, users will be required to download a signed image file, unzip the file and manually run several commands to install the update correctly.

Glass Explorer Edition was the first iteration of the company’s AR smart glasses to be released and the last to be sold to consumers in 2013 – albeit to a very small number of them.
Explorer Edition was made available to just a select number of users at launch – including Google I/O developers and a number of lucky Twitter users – for $1,500 before being pulled off shelves in 2015 and replacing the wearable with an enterprise-focused device.

While Google appears to have had significantly more success with the Enterprise version, even going to far as to release a second version of the business-targeted smart glasses, the fate of Explorer Edition had been left in the dark for quite some time.
It seems Google has decided to put the final nail in the coffin for its pioneering pair of smart glasses with this last update.
While Google will cut support for Glass Explorer Edition early next year, users will have until February 2022 to install the update. These changes will not affect Glass Enterprise users.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Elder Scrolls: Legends has played its final hand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bethesda has confirmed it will stop rolling out new content releases for its strategy card game. In a post on Legends’ official subreddit, the company said it will continue to dole out monthly reward cards and create in-game events – but players shouldn’t hold their breath for any completely new decks.
The announcement may have come as something of a surprise to fans, given that Bethesda had previously released a roadmap outlining its plans for future content. One of the upcoming events in that roadmap was the Winter cardpack expansion, which the company has now confirmed will not be rolled out.
Related: Best PC Games 2019
It also looks like we won’t be getting a console-version of the strategy card game any time soon. Bethesda had announced plans for this at E3 2018, but that development has been nipped in the bud. Despite this, GAEA’s Asia-specific release of Legends will still go ahead, as it’s part of a separate operation.
Legends hasn’t actually been around that long. Although it went through a series of beta releases from 2015 – 2016, we only got the finished free-to-play version in 2017.
In May of last year, Bethesda got rid of developers Dire Wolf Digital from the project and swapped in Sparkypants. Speaking with IGN at the time, Bethesda’s VP said that the switch between companies was “an opportunity to alter the direction” of the game, rather than an indication that Bethesda was dissatisfied with the work done by Dire Wolf.
Related: Best Switch games 2019
Given that the company has decided to pull the plug on the project, it looks like the switch in developers hasn’t had the desired affect of ‘altering the direction’ along a satisfying route.
However, there is a silver lining for Legends fans. As a way of apologising for its abrupt decision, Bethesda is giving away The Tamriel Collection to players for free on their next log-in.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oppo Reno 3 specifications confirmed – could it make 5G affordable?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oppo has announced several specifications of its upcoming Reno 3, and we like what we’ve seen so far – including that it could be one of the first actually affordable 5G phones .
On Twitter, Brian Shen (Oppo’s Vice President and President of Global Marketing) revealed an image of the Oppo Reno 3 Pro 5G, and claimed that at 7.7mm, it might be the “thinnest dual-mode 5G phone in it’s [sic] price segment”. It compares similarly to the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G (7.9mm), and it’s significantly thinner than the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G (8.8mm).

Shen followed up his earlier tweet by announcing that the phone will have a 4025mAh battery, despite its svelte form factor. With the demands of 5G we expect you’ll need that healthy dose of juice, so it’s encouraging to see that the phone manages to combine a manageable size, a large battery, and 5G all in one.

But can Oppo go one better and also make sure that this is an affordable 5G phone? The brand is well-known for delivering good performance on a reasonable budget, and it’s for this reason that we’ve been impressed by previous models such as the Oppo Reno 2 and the Oppo Reno 2Z. Both devices offer flagship-rivalling specs on mid-range budgets, and it would be a coup for Oppo if they could pull off the same trick with 5G phones which until now have been prohibitively expensive.
Related: Best 5G Phones
Now that Qualcomm has announced its new range of chips, including the Snapdragon 865 and the Snapdragon 765, both of which will come running 5G, we expect the market to expand significantly this year, offering consumers far more choice. Xiaomi alone has promised to release ten or more 5G-enabled smartphones over the course of the year, including the Xiaomi Mi 10. More and more, this looks like the right year to make the switch to 5G.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Samsung Galaxy S11 Plus will have a huge battery, apparently</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S11 Plus will have a massive 5000mAh battery, according to a new leak. 
The leak originated with GalaxyClub, who managed to snap a photo of the battery which they claim is intended for the new Samsung Galaxy S11 Plus.
That’s a big battery. The biggest ever fitted to Samsung Galaxy S phone. It needs to be though, as the S11 Plus is reportedly going to pack a 6.9-inch 120Hz screen (via KnowYourMobile.com).
The launch of the S11 range is set to be spread across the first quarter of 2020, so more details will become apparent as release draws nearer.

It’s getting more and more popular to promise “all day battery life” and the S11 Plus should certainly have that, given the huge capacity of its alleged battery. In relative terms, it’s worth remembering that the Samsung Galaxy S10 used a 3400mAh battery and fared okay.
When we reviewed the S1o we loved it. Reviewer, Max Parker, gave the phone a four and a half star rating. However, the battery was not its strongest point.
He said: “For battery life the S10 isn’t as good as some rivals; even similarly sized handsets such as the Huawei P30 Pro beat the S10 for endurance. However, it’s slightly better than the Galaxy S9 and roughly comparable with the iPhone X and iPhone XS.
“During my 10 days with the phone – I’ve been reviewing the European Exynos 9820 version, so US-based buyers with the Snapdragon 855 version might see different results – I haven’t always managed to get from a morning alarm to 11pm without forcing the phone into either a battery-saver mode or worrying it will die-out during something important.”
Samsung are looking to build on the battery life of the S10 then, but also pack in more features. That double-threat is what requires this new high battery capacity for a Samsung S phone. We can’t wait to get our hands on it and put the phone through its paces.

    <h5 class="mb-1">£260 Price Crunch on the iPhone X in time for Christmas for today only</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon has launched its last minute Christmas deals sale and you can pick up an Apple iPhone X with 64GB of storage capacity in black or silver for just £639.
Give the gift of an amazing handset and also that little old thing of not having to pay for a staggeringly high monthly phone bill with the SIM-free iPhone X, now down to £639.

The smartphone itself has long been discontinued from the official Apple Store, though these days the iPhone X handset still usually retails at a pretty dizzying £899 (down from its original £999 value). With a 29% reduction, then, this £260 saving isn’t something to be sniffed at, especially when it’s sure to make someone’s day wrapped up under the Christmas tree.
At the time of release, the iPhone X was Apple’s most innovative handset design yet, finally ditching the thick forehead and chin of its previous iPhones and thinning out the bezels to near invisibility. Taking on a screen that spans the entire surface area of the handset, the home button packing the TouchID finger sensor is well and truly gone, leaving the iPhone X’s 5.8-inch OLED display to stun.
Of course, the first of Apple’s almost edge-to-edge screened iPhones, the iPhone X was also the first bearer of the controversial notch, housing the iPhone’s new unlocking method with face recognition, aptly called FaceID, as well as the 7MP TrueDepth front facing camera.
The rear camera package is another element in which the iPhone X impresses, housing its dual camera set-up, the first time it had appeared on a non-‘Plus’ sized iPhone. Bringing together 12MP main wide-angle camera with a telephoto sensor, the dual camera package also boasts dual Optical Image Stabilisation.

The iPhone X also packs the A11 Bionic and 3GB of RAM, making it a very capable handset, though admittedly a little old and tired compared to the latest A13 Bionic appearing in the latest iPhone 11 family. Still, in our tests we found it to be a competent processor that allowed for the iPhone X to easily complete all that we asked of it with flare.
Down to £639, whether you’re treating yourself or not this Christmas, this is a great steal for those who don’t want to get locked into a lengthy and expensive phone contract. Stick with the SIM-only tariff you’re happy with and save a whopping £260 on the iPhone X before it goes back up in price at midnight.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The old Switch switcheroo – Amazon sends tambourines and toothbrushes to Switch shoppers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever wanted a tambourine? Maybe you should try ordering a Nintendo Switch from Amazon. A crowd of confused shoppers thought they’d gotten their hands on some Black Friday Switch bargains but, when the parcels turned up, there were no Switch consoles in sight. 
Buyers reportedly received tambourines, microphones, toothbrushes and condoms in place of the popular Nintendo console (via The Mirror).
Below is the conversation Amazon customer Jake Lawrence had after he received an unexpected musical delivery:
Microphone AND a tambourine, you say? Well, at least the initial steps in recording your tambourine album are complete, Jake.
Buyers found themselves sent a range of none-Switch products (None-tendo, anyone? No?).
The most baffling part of this story is that it goes beyond a simple error. It’s not as though Amazon’s system had accidentally processed Switch orders as PS4 orders, for example, with all buyers receiving the same incorrect product.
It’s entirely speculative to ask, but this does raise the question: Are the errors a result of over-worked Amazon staff struggling to keep up with – or even rebelling against – the Black Friday and Cyber Monday rush?
Some of the products customers received seem almost willfully random and incongruous.
The Mirror reported a wide range or bizarre cases. Steve Handy from Worcester said that his Nintendo Switch bundle was replaced with a laptop fan cooler.
Likewise, Lucy Henderson received a box of washing powder and a pack of AA Duracell batteries. Nice. Not a Switch, though.
Jenny Breeden from Crawley ordered a Switch too. But, guess what? She didn’t get the console either. Instead Breeden made do with a bottle of washing up liquid and a box of dog food.
You have to feel for those inconvenienced by this Amazon slip-up. Many buyers managed to snatch up the Switch with a hefty discount during Amazon’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, only to have the consoles never turn up. Now, customers are receiving refunds but it seems all will need to pay full price if they want to get their hands on a Switch (for real, this time).
Tim Hobden from Amazon commented: “We’re all about making our customers happy, and that hasn’t happened with these orders. We’re really sorry about that and are investigating exactly what’s happened. We’re reaching out to every customer who’s had a problem and made us aware so we can put it right. Anyone who has had an issue with any order can contact our customer services team for help.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mac Pro will be available to order tomorrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has long promised the updated Mac Pro would be a 2019 product, and with only 23 days left in the year, time is running out. So it’s unsurprising that Apple has reportedly been notifying customers that both the Mac Pro and the accompanying Pro Display XDR will be available to order from Tuesday December 10.
The word comes from YouTuber MKBHD, who tweeted the email Apple sent out. It’s pretty unambiguous as you can see.

What the note doesn’t say is anything about pricing or customisation options. But given we already know that the base model with an eight-core Xeon processor, 32GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and a Radeon Pro 580X graphics card will cost $5999 (~£4557), it’s going to get very expensive, very fast.
The Pro Display XDR isn’t cheap either. Starting at $4999 (~£3797), you can pay an extra $1000 (total: ~£4557) for one with nano-texture coating to reduce glare. With an extra $999 (~£759) for the optional stand, you’re looking at a device that’s very much aimed at art and video making professionals with money to spare.

Aside from Apple’s assurances that the Mac Pro would be a 2019 product, there were other reasons to believe it wouldn’t be allowed to slip into 2020. Not only was it granted FCC approval back in October, but it already seems to have found its way into the hands of prominent creatives – not least the DJ Calvin Harris, who recently featured it in an Instagram story.
It looks like you’ll be able to copy him soon, if you have the money. Here’s hoping that Apple is feeling generous with its $ to £ conversions this month…

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Furniture Fuels AR And Other Retail Innovations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everyone needs furniture and home furnishings, and that need is helping to drive innovation in that sector of the retail economy.
Among the latest examples is a PYMNTS interview with Beck Besecker, CEO and co-founder of Marxent, a company that sells 3D commerce technology. Marxent is finding itself in increasing demand among sellers of furniture and home goods, and that makes Besecker a good tour guide for this growing area of commerce. He told a story of technology moving from “cool-thing” status to an increasingly expected part of the shopping experience (without losing its cool). “When AR came out, it was neat and novel and different,” Besecker said. “It was the first new mobile experience we’d had in many years.”
Indeed, augmented reality (AR) and other visual technologies can be seen as a progression from the earlier days of eCommerce, from all those photos, images and videos placed on retail websites. The goal was – and is – not only to simulate and bolster the physical shopping experience, but to provide confidence-building tools for consumers considering purchases.
Touch and Senses
Touch, of course, remains one of the most important senses when it comes to shopping. Consider the buying process for a car. “When the salesman gets you in the leather seat, you are more likely to buy,” Besecker said. But visuals also do heavy lifting for merchants, especially when the technology, say, enables a consumer to see what a room would look like with new furniture or other objects, or with a different design. Imagination certainly is important, but there are few substitutes for getting a real-deal glimpse of how one’s purchases might fit into existing spaces.
And nowhere is this more applicable than in selling large, expensive goods like furniture. So-called 3D product spins are the set standard, enabling potential buyers to see the item, customized as they want it, to get a visual handle on what they are buying to display in their living room.
It’s still early days for AR, virtual reality (VR) and 3D product visualization, but evidence is mounting that the technology does indeed lead to more sales and larger average order values, at least according to Besecker. For instance, if a room view is offered on a merchant product page, that tool gets used at least 50 percent of the time. As well, consumers who use that tool tend to have a 60 percent to 70 percent increase in shopping cart additions than other consumers. And for pages or products that include AR features, consumers spend four times longer on them than what would normally be the case, Besecker noted.
Uber of Furniture?
That’s not all. There is a move toward creating what would amount to an Uber of furniture.
That is the story of Oliver Space. Its pitch is to provide furniture and design help to people who are moving, but don’t want to drag along old sofas or chairs, aren’t attracted to the IKEA assemble-it-yourself approach – they don’t want to spend any time with screwdrivers, hammers and other tools – or who simply want a new household look without having to spend too much time shopping for furniture.
The idea behind Oliver Space is pretty simple, and would seem to fit within the larger world of subscription commerce and the sharing economy – categories that include Uber, Rent the Runway and various other operations. The company functions as a direct-to-consumer (D2C) operator, having relationships with furniture manufacturers (and a few retailers). For monthly fees, it provides furniture to users, who tend to be young urban professionals. That’s not all, though. Oliver Space also offers, via live chat (available some 14 hours a day) and video conferences, tips and advice about crafting a good look for one’s apartment or other dwelling.
You can expect these innovations to continue into the new decade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jimmy John’s Launches Loyalty Program</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sandwich chain Jimmy John’s announced Monday (Dec. 9) the launch of its first customer-loyalty program.
Freaky Fast Reward, now available nationwide, was tested earlier this year and rolled out on a limited basis, resulting in more than 1.8 million members who have already signed up. For those just joining the program, Jimmy John’s is offering a free 8-inch sandwich after their first order. All members can earn various rewards, including sandwiches, sides, drinks and exclusive first-taste access to new products.
“At Jimmy John’s, we have amazing customers, and we’re committed to rewarding them for their loyalty,” Chief Marketing Officer John Shea said in an emailed press release. “Freaky Fast Rewards is a best-in-class program that makes earning rewards fast and easy.”
Freaky Fast Rewards features one-tap technology that allows members to make purchases via Apple Pay or Google Pay. In addition, the program is fully integrated into Jimmy John’s website and mobile app, where members can track their progress toward their next reward.
Since the pilot launch in March, Freaky Fast Rewards has led to 1,724,623 total rewards redeemed; 50,000 free Little John sandwiches to support October’s national product launch; 268,893 birthdays celebrated with a free sandwich; 24,881 sandwiches given away on Nov. 3, National Sandwich Day; 18,512 pickles given away on Nov. 14, National Pickle Day; and 100,925 free sides earned on this past Cyber Monday (Dec. 2).
“We’re just getting started and it’s already clear that Freaky Fast Rewards is providing value to our customers and improving the customer experience.” said Shea. “To show our customers love, we’re giving them a free sandwich after their first order, just for signing up, and will continue to dream up sandwich-fueled rewards to surprise and delight our customers in the future.”
Jimmy John’s has nearly 2,800 locations across 43 states. In September there were reports that Inspire Brands was planning to acquire Jimmy John’s for an undisclosed price in a deal that would make it the fourth-largest restaurant company in the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deep Dive: Serving Up Better Customer Service With Enhanced CRM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost everyone has experienced a quick food run that turned into a 45-minute ordeal, but such delays are bad news for both quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and patrons. Long drive-through lines can overwhelm employees and frustrate customers, occasionally irritating the latter enough that they leave without making purchases. It is no wonder that so many big-name QSRs are turning to the latest digital technologies to tackle this problem. 
McDonald’s acquired artificial intelligence (AI) startup Dynamic Yield for $300 million in March of 2019 to integrate the latter’s solutions into its customer relationship management (CRM) platform. The new system will maximize profits by enticing drive-through customers to order additional or more expensive menu items, increasing output per second for each location. 
Dynamic Yield’s system gathers data on McDonald’s customers, and records environmental factors, such as location, precipitation and temperature. It then uses AI to analyze the data, and determine which items consumers would be most likely to purchase via drive-through, allowing smart screens to display products like McFlurries on warm days or hot coffee on cold days, for example. Some McDonald’s locations already use such solutions, and the company plans to eventually add the technology to 14,000 U.S. restaurants via drive-throughs, self-service kiosks and its mobile app. 
Implementing this high-level data analysis at such a massive scale may seem like a Herculean task, but McDonald’s is far from the only major QSR chain attempting to do so. Starbucks spent much of 2019 enhancing its own CRM system with an AI solution called Deep Brew to automate menial tasks. KFC and Taco Bell are testing similar concepts at their U.S.- based self-service kiosks and drive-throughs. 
Using complex data systems to boost business is sometimes seen as a cold, calculating way to run customer service-focused industries, but QSRs are using AI-based CRM tools to benefit both themselves and their consumers. The following Deep Dive explores how such software solutions can personalize and enhance consumers’ fast food experiences. 
Personalizing CRM With AI And Machine Learning
CRM refers to the collection of procedures — usually software solutions — that businesses use to interact with their customers. AI- and machine learning-supported systems are at the cutting edge of CRM, and the market for AI-related solutions is rapidly expanding. 
Some estimates claim that AI-enabled CRM software is on course to increase global business revenue by as much as $1.1 trillion from 2017 to 2021. Using such technologies to enhance CRM capabilities allows QSRs to provide customers with AI-enabled screen access at select drive-throughs, offering personalization that would be impossible to match by relying on traditional Excel spreadsheet analysis. QSRs have historically used the latter method to review customers’ data. 
Many QSRs are taking AI-powered solutions even further, providing mobile apps that allow customers to access such services wherever they are — or at least wherever they are before pulling into drive-throughs. Sonic introduced a mobile app in May that authenticates customers’ identities when they log in, retrieving their data and providing them with customized menus catered to their tastes. The app then allows them to change their menu options, and place orders using voice-recognition technology. 
Such AI-powered solutions bring the personalization offered at brick-and-mortar locations to customers’ cars, homes or anywhere else they use merchants’ apps. Consumers once stepped up to registers at their usual fast food locations and ordered from familiar faces who knew their favorite items by heart. They can now enjoy similar experiences via digital technology, thanks to AI-enabled CRM software. 
Expanding Service: The Cloud Factor
AI and machine learning are useful tools, but both run on data. This means QSRs must collect and store both customer and environmental information to harness the full potential of these technologies. 
Such data has historically been stored on in-house servers, but many QSRs are forgoing these solutions for cloud-based servers — outsourced by third-party providers for several reasons. Cloud servers are cheaper to set up and maintain, and they streamline the obtaining and sharing of data because they can be accessed from any location with Wi-Fi. 
Starbucks is a prime example of a QSR that uses cloud-based data storage capabilities to expand its reach. It announced in July that it was teaming up with technology startup Brightloom on a cloud-based solution to bring order-ahead and other services to customers around the globe. The reason was simple: The coffee chain operated in 80 markets, but its mobile app and order-ahead services were available in only half of them. The proposed cloud solution would bring these features to all its customers. 
Freeing Employees From Monotony
Offering customers personalized services is just one benefit of AI-enabled CRM tools. These solutions can also give employees more time to foster personal relationships with brick-and-mortar customers. 
Many QSRs see integrated AI- and machine learning-based CRM systems as tools that can automate routine functions, enabling human workers to concentrate on customer service. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said the company’s goal for its Deep Brew AI is less about reducing costs and enhancing efficiency, but more to focus on “nurturing humanity” by giving monotonous tasks to machines, allowing employees to engage in more creative, rewarding pursuits. Such prioritization can give workers more time and energy to foster strong interpersonal relationships with customers. 
Relying on machines and algorithms to perform basic tasks can reduce human error as well, and these faster automated processes can reduce the time customers spend in line. QSR Chipotle Mexican Grill has seen success with its own AI-based ordering system, which was introduced earlier this year. The system converses with drive-through customers, and transfers the information to human employees, who can more quickly begin working on orders. It also ensures that orders are not misheard, and shields employees from dealing with difficult patrons. The company hopes to implement the system at all 2,500 U.S. locations by 2020. 
The industry is growing increasingly reliant on cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning and cloud-based data storage, but this does not mean QSRs are no longer delivering personalized customer service. These technologies are instead helping businesses to find new ways to deliver high-quality customer service, while reducing human strain. Thus, it falls on individual QSRs to determine which technologies should enhance their CRM systems, and how those solutions can be tailored to provide ideal customer experiences.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NEW DATA: Behind The Consumer’s Surging Interest In Mobile Card Apps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Getting consumers to download new apps can be a tough sell — crowded as the smartphone screens of many already are these days. It may be even more challenging to get them to use new apps on a regular basis before they are banished from their home screens.
However, at least one category of apps appears to be bucking this trend: mobile credit card apps, which enable consumers to check account balances, redeem rewards and receive real-time transaction alerts, among a myriad of other functions. More than 40 percent of U.S. consumers have downloaded card apps, which works out to more than 102 million people. What’s more, consumers are actually using card apps, as 60.7 percent use them several times per week, and 29.4 percent use them at least once per day.
These are among the key findings of the Bridging The Gap: Mobile Card App Adoption Report, a PYMNTS study conducted in partnership with Elan. The Report surveyed nearly 2,000 U.S. consumers across a range of demographic groups to better understand their use of and attitudes toward mobile credit card apps, and the features they consider most compelling.
PYMNTS’ research suggests that consumers consider smartphone apps as natural companions to their credit cards, two items they rarely leave home without. Card apps give users immediate access to account and transaction information when they need it — not just once a month in a paper statement. Indeed, two of the most widely popular app features include the ability to view credit card statements (which was considered important by 68.3 percent of survey respondents) and view recent card activity (cited by 65.6 percent).
If such features are table stakes for compelling card apps, two functions sweeten the pot. The single, most important card app feature in the view of consumers is real-time transaction alerts, cited by 21.1 percent. This is followed by fingerprint login, cited by 19.2 percent. These standout features notably make use of the built-in capabilities of smartphones, placing real-time account information at users’ fingertips, while allowing them to avoid the frustration of passwords or fine print.
The PYMNTS research indicates that consumers are not only increasingly comfortable with using smartphones as financial management tools, but seem to regard them as indispensable for this purpose. This is especially the case for younger generations. More than 90 percent of Gen Z consumers — those aged 18 to 21 — report having downloaded card apps, compared to 24 percent of baby boomers and seniors. Younger consumers also report being more enthusiastic about numerous app features, including fingerprint login.
This is important because younger consumers tend to be trendsetters when it comes to the adoption of new technologies. Their early adoption suggests that interest in mobile card apps will only grow in the years to come. At the same time, younger consumers can also be fickle. This underscores the need for issuers to make card apps as compelling as possible, lest the consumers move on to the latest, greatest app to come along.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ford recalls big pickups; tailgates can open unexpectedly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ford is recalling nearly 262,000 heavy-duty pickup trucks in the U.S. and Canada because the tailgates can open unexpectedly.
The recall covers F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks from the 2017 through 2019 model years. All the trucks have electric tailgate latch release switches in the tailgate handle.
Ford says water can get into the electrical wiring and cause a short circuit, activating the switches and releasing the latches.
The company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries.
Trucks with mechanical tailgate latches are not affected. Dealers will fix the tailgate frame wiring harnesses and install a new tailgate handle release switch.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon has a rather unique deal going on right now for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. You can save up to $150 on these new smartphones, and you're getting Google WiFi thrown in for free. This is for a single Google WiFi, and not a three-pack.
The Google Pixel 4 with Google WiFi comes in at $699 and the Google Pixel 4 XL with Google WiFi comes in at $749. So it's $100 off of the Pixel 4 and $150 off of the Pixel 4 XL.
You can get these for the same price without Google WiFi included too.

Pixel 4 was released just a couple of months ago, back in October. It's currently the latest and greatest smartphone from Google. It comes in two sizes: Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. The main differences between these two are the display sizes and battery capacities. With a 5.7-inch full HD+ display and 2800mAh capacity battery on the smaller Pixel 4. The Pixel 4 XL has a 6.3-inch Quad HD+ display with a 3700mAh capacity battery.
Otherwise, both of these sport the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is a 128GB model, but that is not part of this deal at this price.
What really makes the Pixel impressive though, is the camera. It's a 12-megapixel main sensor here and a 16-megapixel telephoto available as well. This is going to give you some really great Portrait shots, as well as some really good looking zoom shots. Instead of needing to crop after you take the photo, just zoom in and grab it.

Google WiFi is the original mesh WiFi system from Google. It's going to offer you faster speeds, even with more devices on your network. Making it great for smart homes.
You can pick up the Google Pixel 4 and Google WiFi bundle from Amazon by clicking here. It's unclear how long this bundle is going to last.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon is running a sale on the Nintendo Switch right now. It's not really a discount in the price of the Nintendo Switch, instead, you can get a $30 credit when you purchase one. Using the promo code D3E2CDJ6GB6S at checkout. Once you purchase the Nintendo Switch using that code, you will get a $30 credit on your Amazon account within 48 hours.
The Nintendo Switch doesn't really ever get discounted. So getting $30 back on this purchase is the next best thing.
With the Nintendo Switch you're getting a portable gaming console that can also be plugged into your TV for some action on the big screen. Hence the name "Switch". Allowing you to switch from the smaller 7-inch screen to a much larger TV screen.

The Nintendo Switch comes with battery life of four and a half to nine hours. This is going to vary widely based on what game you are playing on the Switch. For example, if you are playing something that isn't as graphic intensive, like Rocket League, you'll likely get closer to that nine hours. Versus something like Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild, which uses a lot more computing power, you may get closer to the four hours.
There are a ton of great games available for the Switch. Two of which we already named. These include Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Fortnite and so much more.
The Switch can also be used for watching content like YouTube since that is available on the Switch. It's a great gaming console for taking on the go with you, since you are able to put it in your bag and even your pocket.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kirin 1020 And Kirin 820 Are Huawei's Next-Gen 5G Chips</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Huawei launched the Kirin 990 flagship mobile SoC in September. Three months later, leaks of its next-gen Kirin chipsets have sprung up revealing some interesting pieces of information. Apparently, the successor to Kirin 990 will be called Kirin 1020, although some reports suggest it might be called Kirin 1000. Huawei also has a midrange SoC in the works, supposedly called Kirin 820. Whatever the naming scheme might be, it looks certain that the new chipsets will bring significant performance and efficiency improvements over their predecessors.
According to a new leak from Slashleaks contributor Teme, the Kirin 1020 will be built on a 5nm EUV process and will integrate the ARM Cortex-A77 CPU architecture. This promises a significant boost in performance as compared to the Kirin 990, which is built on a 7nm EUV process and Cortex-A76 core architecture. According to Teme, the Kirin 1020 will have a 50-percent performance improvement over the Kirin 990.
Such a performance improvement would give Kirin 1020 a solid lead over the likes of Snapdragon 865, Exynos 990, and MediaTek Dimesity 1000. All of these chips have been officially announced to feature Cortex-A77 cores on 7nm processes.

The leaker also disclosed that the Kirin 1020 will be a 5G-only chipset and comes with an integrated 5G modem. It cannot be used to make a 4G-only phone. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 is also a 5G-only chipset, though it needs a separate 5G modem, the Snapdragon X55. There's no modem on board the Snapdragon 865 and it can't be paired with a 4G modem. Samsung's Exynos 990 also uses a separate modem, while the Dimensity 1000 comes with an integrated 5G modem.
The Kirin 1020 will start making its way into devices beginning with the Huawei Mate 40 series in the second half of 2020. Huawei's P40 series will reportedly use the Kirin 990 5G chipset.
In addition to the Kirin 1020 flagship SoC, Huawei is also working on a mid-range chipset. The successor to the Kirin 810, the Kirin 820 will also feature a built-in 5G modem. It'll be based on 7nm technology. Not much else is known about this chipset. However, it's certain that Huawei's looking to bring 5G to the masses with the Kirin 820. It'll reportedly feature either on Huawei Nova 7 or Huawei 10X first.

Having said that, it's still early days and there is always the possibility of a dud leak. As much as the specs seem realistic, there's no way to confirm any of this information. Plenty can change by the time these chips become production-ready. We'll have to wait and see what Huawei has up its sleeves.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Bose Headphones 700 Just Got Its First Price Drop, Now $349</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The brand new Bose Headphones 700 that are replacing the Quiet Comfort 35 Series II headphones, just got their first price drop. We're looking at $50 off of its regular price, down to $349.
Considering Bose products rarely ever see any form of price drops, this is actually a pretty big deal. And now is definitely the time to pick up a pair.
The Bose Headphones 700 are noise cancelling headphones, and do a really great job at doing just that. We're looking at 11 levels of noise cancelling, so you can control distractions and/or let in some ambient sound. This becomes very important when you are walking down the street or on the subway, so you can hear what's going on around you.

Battery life on the Bose Headphones 700 are rated for around 20 hours of usage. That is with noise cancellation turned on. So you can turn those off and get even better battery life.
The design on the Bose Headphones 700 is pretty interesting. Much different from its other headphones. But these are meant to be lighter, so they are more comfortable to wear for many hours on end.
Bose has also included Amazon Alexa support on these headphones. So you can talk to Alexa in any environment using the Bose Headphones 700. There are four adaptive microphones built-in, so it can isolate your voice from the surrounding noise.
Advertisement
You can access Alexa with the push of a button, or by using the wake word. You can ask Alexa for all of the usual stuff like weather, navigation, text messages and so forth. It can also speak to you in English or Spanish.
There is support for Google Assistant on the Bose Headphones 700 as well.
You can pick up the Bose Headphones 700 noise cancelling headphones from Amazon today by clicking here. This price won't be around for long though.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Roomba That Won Black Friday Is Now Even Cheaper</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon has just dropped the price of the iRobot Roomba 671 down to $195, in its Gold Box Deal of the Day today. This brings it even lower than the Roomba 675 was during Black Friday (it was $199). The Roomba 671 and 675 are very, very similar.
This is part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, so this price is only good until midnight PST tonight. So if you're interested in buying the iRobot Roomba 671 today, don't waste any time.
The iRobot Roomba 671 is a pretty impressive robot vacuum – especially not that it's under $200.

With the iRobot Roomba 671, you're going to get the patented 3-stage cleaning system that will loosen, lift and suck up all of the dirt, dust and hair from hard floors and carpet. It also has dual multi-surface brushes that work together to grab dust, dirt and large debris. It also has an auto-adjusting cleaning head that will adapt its height to effectively clean carpets and hard floors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy S11+ Will Sport A 5,000mAh Battery, Along With A 120Hz Display</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Samsung Galaxy S11+ battery capacity has been revealed by SafetyKorea, South Korean certification database. A Samsung-branded battery certification has been spotted, along with a photo of the battery itself.
This battery surfaced with the model number 'EB-BG988ABY'. As you can see, it matches with a model number 'SM-G988', which stands for the Galaxy S11+. This pretty much confirms that the Galaxy S11+ will include a 5,000mAh battery.
If this info ends up being true, this will be the largest battery Samsung has ever placed in one of its flagships. This battery's typical capacity is 5,000mAh, while its rated capacity is 4,855mAh, in case you were wondering.
Advertisement
This battery is manufactured by Samsung SDI in Vietnam. The Galaxy S11+ will need such a large battery, as the phone is rumored to feature a 6.9-inch display. That's not all, though, as that display is said to sport a high refresh rate of 120Hz.
This is a huge boost over the Galaxy S10+'s panel. That handset has a 6.4-inch QHD+ display, with a 60Hz refresh rate. Needless to say, the Galaxy S11+'s panel will be a lot more demanding in terms of battery.
Chances are that Samsung also plans to include 45W fast charging in the Galaxy S11+, as the Galaxy Note 10+ supports it. A Chinese certification listing did confirm the existence of 25W wired charging for the Galaxy S11+, along with 5G, so… Samsung may stick to 25W only. We'll see.
Advertisement
The device is expected to launch with its siblings in February, prior to the MWC. Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S11, and S11e along with the 'Plus' model.
The Samsung Galaxy S11+ will be the largest out of those three phones, and chances are it will arrive in both 4G and 5G variants. The device will be made out of metal and glass, just like its siblings.
You can expect to see a centered display camera hole on the front of the device. The Galaxy S11+ will also have a curved display, and it will probably be slippery.
Advertisement
Samsung will be making a change to a 20:9 display aspect ratio with the Galaxy S11 series, quite probably. That is why Samsung has opted to enlarge display size, even though the device will be taller than ever before.
The company is also rumored to announce the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite in the near future. Those two phones are expected to arrive by the end of this year.
The Galaxy S11 series is expected to bring some significant improvement in the camera department. At least the Galaxy S11+ will sport Samsung's new, custom 108-megapixel camera on the back. If a recent rumor is to be believed, that is.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ulefone Shares 6 Reasons Why You Should Buy The Armor 7 For Christmas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ulefone is very proud of its Armor 7 handset. The company announced that phone a while back, and is now sharing reasons why you should consider getting the Armor 7 as a Christmas gift.
The company listed six reasons why you should consider getting someone, or yourself, the Armor 7 as a Christmas gift. Let's first cover what Ulefone has to say, and then we'll give you some purchasing information.
This is the very first reason. The Ulefone Armor 7 is both IP68/IP69K and MIL-STD-810G certified. So, the phone can withstand water immersion, dust, shock, extreme temperatures, and so on. It also comes with a number of tools and sensors you may need for your adventure.

The Armor 7 is equipped with three rather capable cameras on the back. The main sensor on the back is a 48-megapixel one, and it comes with AI scene recognition. There is also a dedicated 16-megapixel camera for low light photography, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens.
The Helio P90 is one of MediaTek's best mid-range processors, if not the best one. It is quite capable in the processing department, and can handle the most complex AI apps and tasks. The Armor 7 is running quite smooth mainly thanks to this chip.
In addition to the Helio P90, Ulefone also included a lot of RAM inside of this phone. The device includes 8GB of RAM, and that only helps with overall performance. This phone can keep a lot of apps in the background without a problem. It is worth noting that it also comes with 128GB of internal storage.

The Ulefone Armor 7 features a 6.3-inch fullHD+ display with a waterdrop notch. That notch is not large at all, which is a good thing. The phone's display comes with a resolution of 2340 x 1080.
The Armor 7 includes a huge 5,500mAh battery, and 15W fast wired charging. The phone also includes 10W wireless charging, by the way. Ulefone claims that this battery can keep the phone alive for 550 hours on standby, and 25 hours of talk time.
The Ulefone Armor 7 is currently available for purchase via AliExpress and Banggood, if you're interested. The phone is now discounted to $379.86, as part of the company's 12.12 promotion event. If you're interested, you can get the phone via the link below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Electronics Deals – December 9, 2019: Anker, Dash, Crest & More</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today only, Amazon is selling Anker charging accessories for up to 40% off of their regular price. As part of its Gold Box Deal of the Day. Making it a great time to save big on some battery packs, USB-C cables, wall chargers and so much more. These are going to make for some great stocking stuffers this year.
This is another really good deal for some stocking stuffers, or just picking up some stuff you need anyways. Amazon is discounting products from Oral B, Crest, Braun and Pantene today, up to 30% off. This includes razors, trimmers, electric toothbrushes and so much more. All part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day.
Amazon is also taking up to 30% off of Dash Air Fryers today, allowing you to get one for as cheap as $69.99. These are going to allow you to fry food in a more healthy manner. Since you're not putting it in a ton of oil to fry them, you're just using, well air. Air fried french fries still taste really good using the Dash Air Fryers, so definitely a good Christmas gift.

Amazon has discounted the iRobot Roomba i7 (7150) Robot Vacuum today, allowing you to pick it up for just $499. Saving you $200 on its regular price. Now it's important to point out that this is the regular Roomba i7 and not the i7+. Which means that this does not come with the self-emptying base. So keep that in mind before purchasing.
Now that Cyber Monday and Black Friday are over, most of the really big deals are done. But retailers are still offering up some really good prices on different products, so you can still get your holiday shopping done. Since the majority of us weren't able to finish it during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend. You can check out Amazon's latest deals in its 12 Days of Deals sales by clicking here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Galaxy S11+ To Use An "Exclusive" 108MP ISOCELL Sensor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A while back, it was said that the Galaxy S11 series will utilize a "new" 108-megapixel sensor by Samsung. Well, a tipster now released some additional info regarding that, claiming that the Galaxy S11+ will utilize an "exclusive custom" 108MP ISOCELL sensor.
This information comes from Ice Universe, a well-known tipster. He claims that the device will use a 1/1.3-inch 108-megapixel "exclusive custom" sensor. He also noted that the quality of this sensor beats out the ISOCELL Bright HMX.
To those of you who do not know, the ISOCELL Bright HMX is a 108-megapixel sensor that Samsung developed in partnership with Xiaomi. This sensor is already included in some of Xiaomi's devices.

It seems like Samsung is preparing something more powerful for the Galaxy S11+. It's quite interesting that the source did not mention the Galaxy S11 series, but the S11+ in specific. It is suggesting that the Galaxy S11+ will have an upper hand in the camera department, over its siblings.
The last piece of information that Ice Universe shared has to do with the pricing of this sensor. The exclusive custom 108MP ISOCELL sensor that Samsung will allegedly use in the Galaxy S11+ will be expensive. The source simply said that it "has a high cost".
The most interesting part of all this is that the other Galaxy S11 devices have not been mentioned. The Galaxy S11+ could stand on its own thanks to this new sensor.
Advertisement
Just to be clear, this is not an upgrade on top of the Bright HMX. This will allegedly be a new sensor that will be the same size as the Bright HMX.
It was expected that Samsung will develop something new for the Galaxy S11 series. Why? Well, the Bright HMX is considered to be an upper mid-range sensor, not something that would set the Galaxy S11 series apart from the rest.
The Galaxy S11+ will arrive along with the Galaxy S11e and S11. Those three devices are expected to launch in February, prior to the MWC. Samsung did not confirm anything yet, but that will happen if Samsung ends up sticking to its release cycle.
Advertisement
The Galaxy S11+ may differentiate in the camera department, compared to its siblings. We'll just have to wait and see what is Samsung planning, exactly.
All three devices will be made out of metal and glass, and sport a centered display camera hole. We're expecting all three phones to feature a 20:9 display aspect ratio, and be quite slippery.
Android 10 will come pre-installed on these devices, along with One UI 2. Leaks are claiming that all three will feature curved displays. More info will arrive in the coming weeks / months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Redmi K30 Shown In Real-Life Images Prior To Launch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Redmi has been releasing quite a few teasers for the Redmi K30, and the phone has just surfaced in real-life images. If you take a look at the gallery down below, you'll be able to see the device.
Redmi had already confirmed the design of this phone via its teasers. The company showed both the phone's front and back sides in renders. Well, these leaked real-life hands-on images of the Redmi K30 will give you a better idea of what to expect.
The device shown in the images seems to be Pink, or something of the sort. You can clearly see that it will be made out of metal and glass, and sport quite a few cameras on the back.
Advertisement
The phone will include four cameras on the back, it seems. Those cameras will be vertically-aligned, and will protrude on the back a bit. A circular design element will be included around those cameras as well, for aesthetic purposes, probably.
The phone's back side will be curved, as expected. The front side of the phone will be, well, not for everyone. The Redmi K30 will include a rather unseemly pill-shaped camera cutout on the front.
That camera cutout will sit in the top-right corner of the display, and will be similar to the one on the Galaxy S11+. Some people may prefer those display holes, but they surely do not make phones pretty, especially such large ones.
Advertisement
That display camera hole will, of course, also take away from the phone's display. It will be inside of your content, unless Redmi ends up offering a way for you to hide it. That is not a perfect solution, and you'll end up with a rather large bezel up top, but… it's something, at least.
The device will include rather thin bezels overall. Its bottom bezel is expected to be a hair thicker than the rest of its bezels.
In the gallery down below, you can also see the phone's retail box. It looks rather ordinary, a while box with both Xiaomi's and Redmi's brandings on the front. The name of the device is also highlighted here.
Advertisement
The back side of this retail box contains Redmi's dragon logo. This dragon logo hasn't been around for long, the company only started using it a couple of months ago.
The Redmi K30 will become official on December 10, or tomorrow, if you will. It will include 5G connectivity, and it's possible that we'll see both 4G and 5G variants.
The Redmi K30 Pro was not mentioned by the company, so we don't know if it's coming or not. If it launches now, it will be fueled by the Snapdragon 855+, probably. If Redmi opts to wait, it may include the Snapdragon 865. The Redmi K30, on the other hand, will ship with one of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 700 series chips.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blockchain Technology And Mobile Apps In 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has thank-you cards to send to blockchain technology. Without the blockchain, Bitcoin would not have become the financial off-grid power that it is today. Yet, it is more than just Bitcoin fans who need to be grateful to blockchains. Other products and services spanning an array of industries are using blockchains to streamline processes, reduce costs and save time. It has become one of the latest technologies that everyone is trying to tap into – and the world of mobile apps is no different.
Blockchain technology is seeping into how mobile apps are made and what they can achieve. Uncover the details by reading on below.
The Implications of Blockchains and Mobile Apps
Advertisement
1. Borderless Transactions
Using apps to send money abroad is growing in popularity but often remain slow. Blockchain technology is enabling these cross-border payments to become instant when incorporated with cryptocurrency. All you need is access to the app and your own crypto wallet. For Bitcoin fans, the Luno Bitcoin wallet is a secure option and already attracts new users every day.
Having apps that incorporate blockchains to make payments quicker and cheaper is also a real benefit to unbanked populations and one step closer to tackling inequality in deprived regions.

2. Adding Seamless Integrity
Smart contracts could easily be argued as the most impressive and beneficial application of blockchain after Bitcoin. This is why so many app developers are now utilising smart contracts as part of their apps. Ultimately, they help businesses or consumers establish integrity without the need of third parties and can be adapted to a host of business purchases from eCommerce deliveries to freelancing work.
3. Swift Payments
Advertisement
The emergence of blockchain within mobile apps has enabled users to experience uninterrupted secure payment options and services between connected IoT devices. All of which is made real through a platform by the name of IOTA. This platform is the ideal method of developing blockchain applications alongside IoT tools. The end result is high-quality transactions, employing DAG (the acrylic graphic).
4. A Securer System
During transactions, it was always the case that app users would gather data from central servers. Unfortunately, this caused a lot of traffic and issues. Using the blockchain to replace a central server to the app means all devices are updated without lining up to access information. Overall, this leads to apps that run more efficiently and better experiences for their users.

The Future Also Looks to Gaming
There is also the possibility for blockchain games to develop into a prominent feature within mobile apps of the future. In-app gaming has already become extremely popular and combining the blockchain to this trend will open a gateway of new blockchain games that are played, enjoyed and saved on the blockchain without the need for heaps of storage. The pending arrival of 5G technology may also support such a vision.

    <h5 class="mb-1">High-Priced Cosmetics in Rocket League are Causing Outrage Amongst Players</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Sean Carey, 09 Dec 2019Comments
Rocket League's latest update removed blind loot boxes for a more transparent system and went live last week. However, players are not happy with the change, citing prices of around $15 to $20 for a cosmetic and Blueprints being far less rewarding than those of Loot Crates.
Psyonix and Epic ditched their loot crate and key system in favour of Blueprints and Credits. Instead of receiving a blind loot box, players can now see exactly what they are getting, and decide themselves if they want to buy the new premium currency, Credits to unlock a Blueprint. A new Item Shop has been introduced too, that sells retired items found in old crates and timed exclusive items, again for Credits.
Twitter and the game's official subreddit are full of posts from angry players demanding change. Professional Rocket League esports player G2 Rizzo said: "I tried to like it, this update ******* blows. $15 for white Zombas sure I'd allow it, $14 for regular Infiniums, just shove my wallet up my..." (We'll let you work out where that sentence went.)
Over on Steam a player by the name of Jyv who has played over 680 hours of the game left a review and said, "The new blueprint system is a complete rip-off. The prices are nowhere near the market price before the change. You used to spend 20 keys worth for 20 items if you open crates, now you use 20 key's worth to get one item from the shop."
The new premium currency costs about $1 for 100 Credits. However, the more Credits you buy in a bundle, the more of a discount you receive.
The problem that a lot of players are highlighting (besides how expensive everything is), is that most premium items are usually priced a few hundred credits more than the price of a bundle. For a 1200 Credit item, you would need to buy both the 1100 and 500 Credit bundles costing around $15.
Twitter, Steam and the Rocket League subreddit are filled with posts calling for change to the pricing system. However, Psyonix nor Epic Games are yet to address players' concerns.
In the meantime, the internet has been doing what it does best and has been creating memes, calling out Psyonix and Epic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Fi MVNO service has been around for a few years now, and it aims to give customers a reasonably-priced alternative to traditional carriers like AT&T and Verizon while offering a few of its own perks. While Google Fi is technically supported on a broad range of Android and iOS devices, Google has reserved the complete Google Fi experience to Pixel devices and what it calls "Designed for Fi" smartphones (like those from Motorola).
Today, Google announced that all smartphones that are supported on Google Fi will receive a number of features previously reserved for a select few. Now, all Google Fi devices, including the iPhone, support spam call warnings along with the ability to block specific phones numbers from reaching out to you. 
The next two features, however, are reserved just for Android devices. Google’s enhanced virtual private network (VPN) securely encrypts both your Wi-Fi and cellular traffic to disguise your online activity. "Our enhanced network automatically detects when your Wi-Fi connection becomes unusable and then fills in those connection gaps with cellular data," writes Google. Google is quick to point out that even it cannot ascertain your online whereabouts when this feature is enabled.
"If you’ve ever left your house and walked toward your car, you might have noticed your connection slows or even stops altogether as your phone clings to a weakened Wi-Fi connection. With our enhanced network, you’ll have a seamless connection on the go."
One last feature that Google is adding for all Android devices on Google Fi is Wi-Fi calling. With this feature, you can still make or receive phone calls even if you don't have a cellular signal as long as you have a stable Wi-Fi connection.
Google says that all of these features can be enabled by downloading the latest version of the Google Fi app for your device.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's Latest ARCore API Needs Just One Camera For Depth Detection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google has updated the ARCore platform for augmented reality that is offered on both Android and iOS devices. The new ARCore Depth API allows any phone to create a depth map using just a single RGB camera. The depth map is created by taking multiple images from different angles and comparing them as the user moves their phone.
The image below gives a good example of how the new feature benefits AR users. The app being used called AR animals. In one image, the hind legs of the cat are standing on the furniture. The updated version treats the background as 3D with depth and puts the back legs of the cat behind the furniture as it would appear in the real world.
The more realistic AR function will be rolled out to some of the 200 million ARCore-enabled Android smartphones that have the Google app installed starting today. The single-lens approach for depth maps lowers the barrier of entry for smartphones by not requiring makers to integrate specialized cameras and sensors. However, the Depth API will improve with better hardware in phones.
Adding sensors like time-of-flight allows the addition of dynamic occlusion where objects can appear hidden behind moving objects. However, the new update means that Depth API will work on any device supporting ARCore. Google ARCore has been around for a while; it first launched in early 2018 when it exited beta for Android and iOS. At the time, Google said that ARCore was supported on over 100 million devices.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel Makes Quantum Computing Leap With 'Horse Ridge' Cryogenic Control Chip</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While Intel is currently embroiled in a x86-64 processor battle with AMD, the company is also dipping its toes into the future of computing: quantum computing to be exact. The company today announced the fruits of a partnership with QuTech to introduce the first cryogenic control chip for quantum computers.
The chip is codenamed Horse Ridge, and is built on 22-nanonmeter Intel FinFET technology. Quantum computing -- once commercially viable -- will allow a significant leap in processing performance over conventual computers due to the ability to exploit quantum bits (aka, qubits). Qubits can exist in multiple states at once, making it possible to solve complex calculations in a fraction of the time needed for traditional computers or supercomputers.
The beauty of Horse Ridge is that it is a RF processor that dispenses with the need for hundreds of connective wires to interface quantum systems with standard computing devices to control/regulate performance. The connective wires can be a hindrance to scaling qubit processing, which is why Horse Ridge takes on the form of a SoC that streamlines the interface and replaces the rudimentary instruments currently in place.
Intel says that Horse Ridge "allow[s] for sophisticated signal processing techniques to accelerate set-up time, improve qubit performance and enable the system to efficiently scale to larger qubit counts." In addition, Horse Ridge brings the control system much closer to the cryogenic refrigerator.
"It effectively reduces the complexity of quantum control engineering from hundreds of cables running into and out of a refrigerator to a single, unified package operating near the quantum device," Intel adds.
Horse Ridge has been designed to operate at temperatures of 4 Kelvin, or -452.47 degrees Fahrenheit. This is just slightly above absolute zero, which is -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit. This operating temperature is slightly warmer (relatively speaking) than modern quantum computers, which will help to strip away some of the significant cooling requirements currently in place.
"While there has been a lot of emphasis on the qubits themselves, the ability to control many qubits at the same time had been a challenge for the industry," wrote Jim Clarke, Intel director of Quantum Hardware. "Intel recognized that quantum controls were an essential piece of the puzzle we needed to solve in order to develop a large-scale commercial quantum system. That's why we are investing in quantum error correction and controls. With Horse Ridge, Intel has developed a scalable control system that will allow us to significantly speed up testing and realize the potential of quantum computing."
Intel's advances with Horse Ridge are just the next step in making quantum computing a practical reality that can leap beyond the research laboratory setting.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Free Windows 7 Extended Security Updates Can Be Enabled For Anyone With This Bypass Tool</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The end of extended support for Windows 7 is fast approaching, and Microsoft has been doing everything in its power to get users to upgrade to Windows 10. The most visible way that Microsoft has been nudging users has been to display pop-up nag screens encouraging them to abandon the 10-year-old operating system.
Officially, extended support ends on January 14th, 2020 -- meaning no more OS or security updates -- but Microsoft will allow enterprise customers to pay for continual updates to Windows 7. Microsoft is charging between $25 to $200 per workstation (per year) for Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESUs). However, community members over at My Digital Life have crafted a special software tool that in essences bypasses the key check process that Microsoft has implemented to ensure that a system is authorized to receive paid ESUs.
The software bypass, which was first noted by ZDNet, is a result of KB4528069 for Windows 7 ESU that landed back in November. Specifically, the update has one primary purpose:
Administrators are then required to provide an ESU license to ensure that systems are ready to go when the first updates arrive after the January 14th cutoff. The BypassESU tool is by no means authorized or condoned by Microsoft. In fact, we'd imagine that Microsoft is probably a bit irate about the very existence of the tool, as it would cut off an added revenue stream for customers too stubborn to upgrade to Windows 10.
With that being said, Windows 7 ESUs are not meant to be a long-term solution, and they will cease completely in 2023 -- a full 14 years after Windows 7 was first released. It's impressive that Microsoft has supported Windows 7 this long, but it's really time for businesses to start looking towards upgrading rather than paying through the nose to support an operating system that is on life support.

    <h5 class="mb-1">iPhone 12 Could Get Another Battery Boost Due To This Important Hardware Upgrade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Apple releases its iPhone 12 series next year, there is a chance the next-generation phones could come with a significant bump in battery life. The same goes for Samsung's Galaxy S11 family. That's because both Apple and Samsung are sourcing smaller battery protection modules from the same company, ITM Semiconductor, with smaller circuitry to potentially pave the wave for bigger capacity batteries.For reference, Apple claims "all-day battery" life on its iPhone 11, which equates to up to 17 hours of video playback (or 10 hours of streamed video), and up to 65 hours of audio playback (with the ability to generate a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes via fast-charge). Likewise, Samsung claims "all day intelligent battery" life on its Galaxy S10.
Source: ITM Semiconductor (via MacRumors)To improve things even further, ITM Semiconductor has developed a battery protection circuit module (PCM) that is nearly 50 percent smaller. This is the circuitry that protects hardware from over charging and over discharging. The module also combines the protection circuit with a MOSFET and PCB, which negates the need for a chassis for all this stuff.While this may not seem like a huge deal, as smartphones become thinner and more sophisticated, space is at a premium. This overall reduction means Apple and Samsung could potentially use larger battery packs inside their next-generation smartphones. It's not a given that either will actually do that, but if so, we could be looking at even longer battery life next round.The iPhone 12 probably will not be announced until September 2020. However, the Galaxy S11 will debut a lot sooner—likely in in February. So, we'll know fairly soon whether this development yields any gains in real-world battery life.In addition to next-gen smartphones, it's said this tech could also be applied to tablets and PCs (laptops, we assume).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel Auto Call Screening, Memory Management Updates Coming With New 'Feature Drop'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Pixel 4 family is famous for its strong support from Google. Google tends to support the devices with three years of major Android OS, along with feature/security updates, which is much better than we typically expect from other Android OEMs. Google is now introducing a new category of updates for its Pixel devices, and it is calling it a "feature drop".
Google says that feature drops bring bigger and more impactful updates than the typical security updates and bug fixes, and will come "on a regular basis." The first feature drop is coming later this month and includes a handful of new features for Pixel users.
One of the most prominent additions is the ability for the Google Assistant to automatically screen calls. The feature should help to make your life a bit more manageable as it will not only detect robocalls, but it will also screen unknown callers before your phone even rings. If the Google Assistant determines that the call is actually important, Google says that "your phone rings a few moments later with helpful context" about the caller.
Other new features that will be arriving this month include the ability to apply portrait "blur" to an image post-capture, and auto-framing for Duo video calls. The latter update will automatically keep your face centered thanks to the use of the Pixel 4's wide-angle selfie camera. Portrait-style effects can be applied for Duo calls to blur out your background (especially helpful if your room or office is a disaster) and is applicable to the Pixel 2, Pixel 3 and Pixel 4.
Rounding out the bevy of new functionality are improvements to memory management, which will be especially welcome to Pixel 3 and Pixel 2 owners. According to Google, "Your phone proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more."
Google says that the first feature drop is already in the process of being pushed out to Pixel owners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Could This Be The OnePlus 8 Lite Phone On Deck For A 2020 Launch?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There might not be all that many surprises from OnePlus in 2020, at least in regards to its OnePlus 8 series of smartphones. We have already seen leaked renders of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro over the past few months. Now we can add a OnePlus 8 Lite model to the mix, with a fresh set of renders showing off the device.In case you missed any of the past leaks, the OnePlus 8 will supposedly launch with a curved-edge display sporting a punch-hole design, and three cameras on the rear on the device. The OnePlus 8 Pro, meanwhile, sports a similar design with the same curved-edge display and punch-hole design for the front camera, but with a quad-camera arrangement on the back.Both of those are going to be high-end handsets that occupy the flagship space. The OnePlus 8 Lite, however, is poised to be a mid-range phone with a design that is more in line with Samsung's Galaxy S11, Note 10 Lite, and Galaxy A91.
As has been a recurring collaboration, notorious leaker @OnLeaks joined forces with 91mobiles to post a handful of renders showcasing the OnePlus 8 Lite. Unlike the other two phones in the OnePlus 8 series, the OnePlus 8 Lite touts a flat-display design, which is estimated to be between 6.4 and 6.5 inches. It also sports a punch-hole cutout for the front camera, positioned in the center at the top of the handset.We can also make out some other details, such as a Type-C port on the bottom and an alert slider on the side. Missing, however, is a 3.5mm headphone jack.On the back, there is a curved glass panel with a reflective finish. We also see a rectangular housing of the rear cameras—there appear to be two camera lenses, along with an LED flash and some other sensors (possibly a Time of Flight sensor being among them).OnLeaks says the phone measures around 159.2 x 74 8.6mm. Beyond that, there are no other concrete details, such as which processor will be inside, what the specs of the cameras are, and whether or not it will feature a 90Hz refresh rate display like the other two OnePlus 8 models.Images Source: 91mobiles (via OnLeaks)

    <h5 class="mb-1">All Sony PS5 Games Could Enable Multiplayer With Cloud Controller Sharing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It will be around a full year before Sony rolls out its next-generation PlayStation 5 console, and in the meantime, we are left to scrape details from little nuggets Sony shares here and there, the usual rounds of leaks and rumors, and perhaps patent applications as well. As it pertains to the latter, Sony was just recently granted an interesting patent that could potentially turn any single-player game into a multi-player experience.As things currently stand, developers choose to make a game single-player or multi-player, and players are pretty much bound to that decision. There are end-arounds, of course, such as taking turns controlling a character if two or more people happen to be in the same room. But whether that makes sense depends on the game, and the situation.Sony's patent (PDF), which was filed around the middle of 2018, describes a sort of similar concept as one of the potential multi-player aspects. It really relates to the controller, and potentially the DualShock 5 (if Sony implements any of what it describes).By leveraging the cloud, multiple gamers in different locations could share the duties of character control in a single-player game. It's essentially a "bifurcation" scheme, and while it sounds interesting, I'm not sure it would catch on if Sony ran with the idea.
Source: Sony (via USPTO)In one of the descriptions, Sony talks about multiple people controlling different actions from the same character. Imagine a fighting game. One person could control the character's movement, while a friend that lives down the street for across the globe could input various attacks (kicks, punches, etc). By doing this, a single-player fighting game becomes a multi-player experience, albeit in a weird way.The same could apply to a first-person shooter or a third-person title, or pretty much any game. Whatever the case, it's based on divvying up the different parts of a controller—one person could control the thumbsticks, another one could have control of the main buttons, and yet another player could take control of the triggers.I see this as being more of a hassle than a fun experience, though I suppose it depends on the game (and gamers). That's not the only use-case scenario, though. Another one Sony describes is taking turns controlling a character. This could be done through a timer, or when certain goals (such as points) are achieved. One person would control the character to begin, and after a set amount of time or after achieving a certain goal, another person would get a turn.This is more interesting to me, as opposed to multiple people trying to get in sync with controlling parts of a character at the same time. Whether any of the functions described actually make it into the PS5, however, we will have to wait and see. The PS5 is set to launch in holiday 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Infinity Ward Sends Out Modern Warfare Survey Aiming To Woo Unimpressed Gamers Back</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's only been a short while since the reboot of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare launched. Unfortunately for Activision and Infinity Ward, many have have stopped playing the game. Infinity Ward wants to know exactly why the players stopped playing, and has sent out a survey to try and figure out how to lure them back. Gamers have complained vocally about a myriad of issues with Modern Warfare since its launch.
Among the complaints that fans of the game have are bugs and exploits, map design, skill-based matchmaking issues, weapon balance, and more. The devs say that they have been working to resolve those issues since day one. Infinity Ward did release a patch on December 6 that addressed some of the player complaints, and marked the return of a fan-favorite Shoot House 24/7 playlist.
The devs are increasingly trying to win back players back that aren't publicly complaining about issues, but instead choose to stop playing the game altogether. To figure out what drove gamers away a survey has been sent to players who have played less since the game launched. The survey offered a long list of reasons why gamers moved on from Modern Warfare, and the screenshot below allegedly shows some of the options.
Some of the listed issues are common and have been complained about since the game launched by players of all skill levels. The long list should mean that gamers can choose the exact reasons why they stopped playing the game. It's only been two months since Modern Warfare launched, so the fact that Infinity Ward needs to send out this sort of survey so early is a concern for fans of the franchise.
In other Modern Warfare news, we've talked about some of the weapon exploits, like a shotgun issue that made the weapon a one-shot kill wonder even from across the map. In addition, the game made $600 million in three days when it launched.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla To Charge $10 Per Month For "Premium Connectivity" Features</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everyone was expecting this to happen at one point and the impending change is finally here. Tesla will start to charge $9.99 per month for data connectivity from the Tesla owners who purchased their vehicles on or after July 1, 2018.
Last summer, Tesla had announced they were going to introduce new tiers: Standard Connectivity and Premium Connectivity.
SEE ALSO: TESLA LAUNCHES ITS FIRST-EVER PORTABLE CHARGING STATION FOR $500
Standard Connectivity offers basic maps navigation, music and media over Bluetooth and software updates over Wi-Fi. It will be included on all Tesla cars at no additional cost. The new charged features are bundled into what Tesla calls "Premium Connectivity", which includes satellite-view maps, live traffic visualization, and in-car video streaming services such as Youtube and Netflix. 
Owners who purchase the Model S, X, Model 3 with the "premium interior" get a one-year trial of Premium Connectivity after purchasing the car. Owners purchasing a Model 3 with “standard” or “partial premium interior” get a 30-day trial with the purchase of the vehicle.
In summary, all cars, except the base versions of the Model 3, sold before July 2018 have the Premium Connectivity features included for free for the car's lifetime. However, everyone else will have to pay eventually.
It appears that Tesla is concerned about the escalating data cost and drivers are expected to shoulder some of that burden. Obviously, if you can afford a Tesla, you will probably have $120 to spare per year for music and satellite data purposes. Still, this new addition might be rough on some buyer's wallets. 
Free access to data features has been a Tesla building stone for Tesla for years; however, this new addition seems to have turned the tables around. Customers will need to add Tesla data costs to their monthly Spotify and Netflix payments and the oncoming days will show how the owners will react.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Creaform Measures Up for Cutting-Edge Sailing Yacht Design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The America’s Cup represents the pinnacle of competition within the world of sailing yachts. From the first America’s Cup regatta around the Isle of Wight in 1851 until today, winning the trophy has been the goal of mariners from across the world. To emerge with the America’s Cup, a team needs expertise, precision, and, of course, plenty of speed.
Out of the water, the same rules apply: To prepare yachts to compete for the America’s Cup, teams must rely on expert partners who can help them precisely and accurately measure to specifications and quickly improve performance.
For the 2021 America’s Cup competition, the American Magic team representing the famed New York Yacht Club turned to Creaform as their official supplier of 3D measurement technology.
Creaform is an industry-leading company in the field of 3D measurement technologies. The Creaform product line helps ensure quality outcomes for clients in diverse manufacturing sectors such as automotive, aerospace, consumer products, and shipbuilding, which includes competitive yachting.
Creaform’s sophisticated and user-friendly line of measurement solutions worked together in perfect harmony on behalf of DEFIANT (the recently-released name of the American Magic yacht).
These powerful tools have been optimized to meet the needs of design, manufacturing, and metrology professionals looking for the most effective and reliable ways to acquire accurate 3D measurements of physical objects, even in difficult environments and with projects featuring complex surfaces. 
The HandySCAN 3D™ is a portable, handheld 3D laser scanner that takes thousands of measurements a second, is accurate to 30 µm, and automatically generates a high-resolution mesh in just seconds.
All of this allows Creaform clients to acquire fast, accurate, robust in-situ manufacturing process data. As-built models can then be 3D printed and rigorously tested to ensure that the system or project in question meets design specifications and will perform as expected.
To acquire measurements from large parts, American Magic relied on the MetraSCAN 3D, HandyPROBE and MaxSHOT 3D, a complete optical 3D metrology solution.
The MetraSCAN 3D™ is a portable, optical CMM 3D scanner that helps operators better manage processes and respond faster to the industry’s increasing quality control requirements—all without compromising the manufacturing throughput.
Optical metrology provides measurement accuracy that is insensitive to the instabilities of the environment, making the MetraSCAN 3D optical CMM the prime choice for shop-floor quality control metrology.
The HandyPROBE™ Next is a portable CMM that provides great measurement accuracy. Free of any rigid measurement setup, the HandyPROBE outperforms traditional portable CMMs on the shop floor.
The C-Track optical tracker and wireless probe can be moved at any time during the measurement sequence and generate the same high-quality data. This metrology inspection solution helps manufacturing companies eliminate inefficiencies and avoid unnecessary expenses.
Finally, Creaform’s MaxSHOT 3D™ is a game-changer for product development, manufacturing, quality control, and inspection teams that need the highest measurement accuracy and repeatability for large-scale projects. Thanks to its sophisticated user guidance technology and easy-to-use software, the MaxSHOT 3D is ideal for users of all levels—even those without metrology training—providing peace of mind in terms of accuracy and process efficiency.
In the case of the sleek, lightweight, and sturdy carbon-fiber components found on the DEFIANT, this kind of measurement power can mean the difference between victory or defeat. The engineers working on this project frequently employed Creaform equipment not only to develop various systems, but also for quality control to make certain that everything worked as per the exact design specifications.
Robyn Lesh used the HandySCAN 3D to design a perfectly fitted fairing to smooth the DEFIANT’s aggressive surfaces.
For example, the American Magic team utilized a revolutionary foiling monohull that can achieve a mind-boggling 50 knots under full sail. However, portions of the surface of this hull were, in the words of design team member Robyn Lesh, “aggressive,” meaning neither smooth nor particularly aerodynamic. That surface needed to be tamed to maximize speed and maneuverability, and the answer was to fit it with a fairing—a part placed on top of this bumpy surface to smooth it out and thereby reduce drag.
When it comes to a highly precise process such as creating a fairing, having a bad (or incomplete) input in the development process often leads to a bad output, and to fix that bad output can take time through trial and error. By using the HandySCAN 3D, however, Lesh and her team obtained the exact shape right away.
“We could have just guessed on the shape to make exterior and spent hours and hours and hours fitting the inside,” says Lesh. “But what we did was to 3D scan the section to create the piece we put on top.”
Another member of the design team, Paul-Louis Defretiere, speaks about the speed and efficiency that 3D scanning brings to the project. “In our time scale, it’s key to go very quickly from the scanning file to a file we can use in the 3D modeling. [Creaform products are] very fast.”
Indeed, what Defretiere is expressing here is the fact that Creaform equipment can scan directly to mesh in an .stl format. There’s no need to process a point cloud. VXelements, Creaform’s software suite that’s fully integrated with the scanner, makes the scan-to-CAD process easier and faster.
Creaform integrated software suite offers powerful and easy scan-to-CAD capabilities for fast data output in your design workflow.
The American Magic project proves that a world-class metrology company like Creaform offers partners abundant benefits in terms of advanced manufacturing efficiency and lightning-fast time-to-market. That adds up to significant savings both in terms of time and money to manufacturers working within hyper-competitive environments demanding extremely tight measurement tolerances.
Not every project involves ensuring world-class performance excellence for sailing yachts competing in the oldest event in international sports. However, every client, regardless of size, scale, or prestige, wants to measure better, faster, and more accurately today than they did yesterday, and they want to do it better tomorrow than they did it today.
Exceptionally accurate, nimble, and quick 3D scanning is clearly a differentiator for any company, anywhere, that wants to keep pushing the envelope in terms of eliminating waste and improving performance. And, let’s face it—that’s every company, everywhere, in the world today.
As measurement experts like those at Creaform demonstrate, that kind of quality is now within reach for all organizations. Whether competing for the America’s Cup or that next contract, regardless of speed to the finish line or speed-to-market, there’s little question that technology is the deciding factor over who wins and who loses.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holiday gift guide 2019: iPhones, cases and peripherals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the holidays just around the corner from Thanksgiving this year, people are already in full swing of trying to figure out what gifts to get their favorite people. If you’re buying for an Apple fan, or someone that enjoys using their iPhone, then this guide will breakdown quite a few great gift options that we think any iPhone user will love to unwrap this holiday season.
If your loved ones are looking to pick up a new iPhone this holiday season, then you’ve got quite a few choices to choose from. For instance, many retailers have been running some solid deals on devices like the iPhone 11 and even the iPhone 11 Pro, making it easier for users to pick up the latest iPhone at discounted prices.
Of course, these prices are changing all the time, so you’ll want to make sure you keep an eye on retailers like Verizon, AT&T, or whatever other carriers you might be looking to pick up an iPhone on. We’ve seen quite a number of great deals over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping sprees this year, and we expect we’ll see some additional deals crop up over the coming months. We’ll keep an eye out for any good deals that pop up over the coming weeks, so check back for links to those as they become available.
For those who spend a lot of time on the go, though, a gift like a pair of the latest Apple AirPods could go the distance. There are a couple of different options to go with here, including the normal AirPods and the AirPods Pro that feature a wireless charging case. This really all comes down to how much you want to spend and what you think will work best for your iPhone users.
On top of picking up a pair of Apple AirPods, you might also want to consider grabbing a Spigen AirPods Strap. While more well known for their budget-friendly cases, Spigen’s AirPods Strap allows you to add a strap to your AirPods. Not only does this give them the more nostalgic look of the older Apple earbuds, but it also allows you to keep up with your AirPods a bit easier, which is a win/win in our opinion.
The latest and greatest in the Apple Watch line-up, the Series 5 devices are sure to be at the top of any iPhone user’s holiday wishlist. Not only is the Apple Watch great for telling time, but it also connects easily with your Apple device and makes it easy to keep up with all your latest notifications to ensure you never miss a beat throughout the workday.
The Apple Watch Series 5 is available starting at just $399, though going with a more traditional band like the Gold Stainless Steel Case with Sport Loop will raise the price upwards to $699. Of course, you might also find some solid deals on these brand-new devices as we get closer to the holiday, so keep an eye out at retailers like Amazon, Verizon, or even the Apple Store for some decent discounts.
When it comes to peripherals, especially in this day and age, you’re going to find far more options than you know what to do with. But if you’re looking to get your iPhone users the best goodies to go along with their shiny new iPhone, then tools like this Portable External Battery Pack from Anker should be high on your list of must-buy items. Clocking in at 20100mAh, this ultra-high capacity power bank will allow you to charge your iPhone 5-7 times over on one full charge. Of course, recharging it will take about 10 hours, but that’s a very small price to pay to ensure you never run out of juice on your iPhone.
If the iPhone users in your life haven’t quite embraced Apple’s courageous move to get rid of the headphone jack and limit the ability to charge your phone and listen to music via wired headphones, then you can also look into picking up a charger adapter that features a 3.5mm headphone jack. This will allow you to charge up your iPhone while you listen to music on a regular set of earbuds, something that’s been impossible to do natively without the use of Bluetooth headphones. You can buy it on Amazon for about $10 at regular price.
Perhaps one of the coolest new features of the Apple ecosystem, Apple Arcade brings a ton of great games into the users’ library for a low monthly fee. At just $4.99 a month, you can get your loved ones a slew of great mobile games to enjoy on their iPhone no matter where they are. What’s more, that single subscription gets up to six members of your family access to all the goodies that Apple Arcade has to offer, making it even easier to purchase this gift for multiple iPhone users in your life.
Truth to be told, there are a ton of great gifts out there for the iPhone users that you have in your family. This list is just the start. If you’re still having trouble finding some great gifts for the iPhone fans in your family, then be sure to take a look at the offerings we’ve pointed out above, and then go from there. There are also a number of great cases available for the iPhone that will help protect your investment. Cases like the Lifeproof waterproof case or even the Otterbox can be great for those who have a nasty habit of dropping their phone all the time. You can also check out the rest of our Holiday Gift guides for even more helpful information and ideas.

    <h5 class="mb-1">When Discord's Down, All Hell Breaks Loose</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google’s suite of cloud computing services were hit with some technical difficulties most of the day Saturday that caused connectivity problems on at least one of the services dependent on it: Discord, a chat and voice platform geared towards gamers (don’t worry, it’s back up now).
Now, if you don’t use Discord, you likely didn’t notice anything was up.
But for those of us that do, let me tell you: It was absolute chaos.
In a matter of hours, the hashtag “discorddown” started trending on Twitter as users worldwide posted about their struggles with latency and messaging failures. It may seem like much ado about nothing (and I’m sure plenty of reactions were played up for the fun of it) but Discord’s whole spiel is about building communities through dedicated servers, even if some of them fly screaming off the rails occasionally. When it goes down, so does an instant connection to slews of people users may interact with regularly; it feels more like losing your entire phone than missing a social media feed.
And just in terms of numbers, there are as many Discord users as Fortnite players and they send roughly 100 million messages a day according to company estimates, and that is a lot of pissed off folks. A few seemed ready to take drastic measures, floating the idea of returning to ye old gamer chatrooms of ages past like the Nintendo DS’s Pictochat or the Wii U’s Miiverse, with other, more general services like Skype and AIM (RIP) also receiving shoutouts.
Discord began investigating the issue around 3pm GMT Saturday after the company’s engineers noticed “anomalously high iowait” across its databases, according to Discord’s online status report. A later update from Google pinpointed the problem as “an issue with SSD Persistent Disk and SSD Regional Persistent Disks,” a.k.a. where Discord and other services using GCP store data from their servers.
In a statement to Gizmodo, Discord described the hiccup as an “issue with Google Computer Platform that’s affecting our service” and that their team was “actively working with Google to resolve this issue.” The company also tweeted its apologies for the outage, which, of course, prompted several frustrated comments and many, many more memes.
When reached, Google offered no further comment than the details posted on its online status board, which marked the problem as resolved at approximately 10 pm GMT.
A statement on Discord’s status board around the same time described the situation as “stable,” though the company said it’s still finalising recovery efforts with its search APIs.
If you and your crew had to homebrew a solution to work around Discord’s outage, feel free to share your story in the comments.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two years after a forum thread on having Spotify support on the Nintendo Switch, the music streaming app still isn't on there.
And it won't be, so stop asking. And if it ever is, you're going to be the last to know about it, so pipe the fuck down. That's the takeaway from the update on that forum post at least, that went up last week.
The initial post from an eager Spotendo fanboy reads:
Even in the face of all caps, Spotify has unequivocally said that it won't be coming to the console - that has since had a second iteration as a dedicated handheld with the Switch Lite - and that it's not something they'd be telling any Tom, Dick, or Harry about anyway. Spotify's recent update reads:
For some reason, people can't quite seem to accept the idea of a device that's not bloated with every single app you could possibly think of, and as a result, the Switch finds itself at the centre of conversations about which media apps will be made available on the platform, and a lot of pissing and moaning about the ones that aren't.
You've got a dozen devices that all of these apps are available on. The Switch is a perfectly fine console, and the tablets and smartphones you have are likely better suited for streaming than the console is. Nintendo's Switch doesn't need streaming apps, so stop your whinging. [Ubergizmo]

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple May Be Revisiting the iPhone 9 Next Year With the SE 2</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The iPhone SE 2 series has been rumoured for a while, but it looks like it may usurp the title of iPhone 9.
Japanese blog Macotakara claims to have an insider who confirms that the iPhone SE 2 will actually be dubbed the iPhone 9, which Apple previously skipped over - and will house the same A13 processor as the iPhone 11 series.
Apple first launched its  midrange smartphone in 2016 but it was discontinued last year, leaving pricey handsets as the only option for its customers. Since October, we've hears rumours about the return of the iPhone SE 2 and the iPhone SE 2 Plus, positioned for a 2021 launch.
Last week, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo detailed his predictions for Apple's releases for 2020 and 2021, and coupled with this latest titbit, we're expecting to see the iPhone SE 2 (or iPhone 9) roll out next year with a price point as low as $399/ £300.
Coupled with his other predictions, we're looking at a possible five devices being released into the market next year, with an additional two devices (including the iPhone SE 2 Plus) launching the following year. [TechRadar]

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Upcoming OnePlus 8 Series Could Feature a Budget Lite Model</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Next year might see OnePlus return to offering consumers a low cost handset alongside its flagship smartphones.
Following rumours of a premium OnePlus 8 Pro boasting a 120hz display, it seems that the company is also reintroducing a more affordable option, harking back to the days of the shockingly inexpensive OnePlus X.
91Mobiles and OnLeaks have released CAD-based renders of the device along with minimal specs based on what's visible.
The smartphone will reportedly have either a 6.4-inch or 6.5-inch display with a hole-punch camera front and centre. The lack of a visible fingerprint scanner suggests it'll be an under-display scanner. The screen itself will be flat rather than curved, although the rear comprises a curved glass panel to jazz things up a bit.
The rectangular raised rear camera will have just two lenses, a flash, and a possible ToF sensor. Meanwhile, at the bottom, there appears to be a USB-C port and no headphone jack, because mobile phone manufacturers suck.
If the pricing follows on from the super cheap OnePlus X, that barely brushed the £200 price point, we could see a OnePlus phone launching with a price tag of less than £500 for a change. We'll have to wait for a few more solid details before speculating too much on all of this though, so take the news with a pinch of salt. [Engadget]

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There's a new rail franchise dealing with our complaints about the Wi-Fi not working and the toilets oozing piss and bleach out into the corridors today, with Avanti West Coast taking over the business of running what was once the Virgin Trains line between London and Scotland.
As many as two trains have received the new Avanti paint/decals overhaul so far, a refresh that rail enthusiasts are describing as a bit boring and a bit British Rail – and Virgin took all the train name plates with them too – but it will probably do. The first of these newly liveried trains departed from London Euston yesterday morning, and did a fine PR job for the line all the way up to Manchester, as staff explained to local press that the triangle is not an entirely random design phenomenon; it represents the points on the map of the line's main terminals.
Inevitably, people were complaining at Avanti from the very off. The Wi-Fi on the 7:20am departure today didn't work and the new booking site doesn't let people pick specific seats, nor does the new operator's app mirror Virgin's platform reminder text system. At least Avanti has the Delay repay site up and ready for action. [Twitter]

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amazon's NHS Collaboration Will See the US Company Get Access to Medical Data for Free</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It turns out that the government's deal with Amazon to provide medical date for Alexa to parrot at people is a bit shit for the NHS.
We first heard word of the NHS and Alexa crossing paths back in February, with a follow-up in July that saw the government agreeing to let Alexa draw data from the official NHS advice website to answer questions from worry warts, hypochondriacs, and people who are too stubborn to go to the doctors. It also solves accessibility issues for people who "may not have been able to easily access nhs.uk content via a mobile device or computer in the past,” according to an NHS spokesperson.
The contract has since been released and the finer details seem somewhat sketchy. The NHS blog already explained that it would be giving away data (not patient data) for free which didn't seem too controversial initially. A number of other bodies also use the info for free, but only within the UK under the current agreements.
The Amazon deal will see the billion dollar company take all that free info, disseminate it worldwide, and use all that data to create "new products, applications, cloud-based services and/or distributed software”, of which the NHS would get precisely zero kickback from.
The contract has been criticised by Labour’s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, who told the Sunday Times that the whole thing is “highly irresponsible” and that the government is "in the pocket of big corporate interests”.
The NHS and Amazon have only commented on the agreement in order to reassure everyone that their patient data isn't being provided along with everything else. [The Guardian]

    <h5 class="mb-1">Social Media Companies Aren’t Even Close to Fixing Their Bot Problem, Report Finds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers with the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence released a report last week showing that – shocker! – it remains as easy as ever to buy followers and engagement on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.
The researchers wrote in the report that they tested the preparedness of the four sites by purchasing engagement on 105 separate posts on the four sites using 16 “social media manipulation service providers” (11 of them Russian, with the other five operating out of Europe). For just 300 EUR (about £252), the team was able to lure 3,530 comments, 25,750 likes, 20,000 views and 5,100 followers – in the process identifying 18,739 accounts “used to manipulate social media platforms”.
The team also found that four weeks later, about 80 per cent of the inauthentic engagements they had purchased were still online. They also reported a sample of the nearly 19,000 accounts involved in cooking the books to the social networks themselves, finding that some 95 per cent remained online after three weeks.
The centre advises NATO and bears its name but is organisationally independent of the military alliance, according to the New York Times. While most of the tests were run on accounts created for the experiment, they also boosted some posts from verified accounts like European Union antitrust enforcer Margrethe Vestager and justice commissioner Vera Jourova – but only ones that were at least six months old and conveying apolitical sentiments to avoid having an impact on real conversations. According to the report, there appeared to be no mechanisms in place to better police the verified accounts than the artificial ones.
The report states that far from being a “shadowy underworld”, social media manipulation is an “accessible marketplace that most web users can reach with little effort through any search engine”. In many cases, the firms involved in such work openly advertised purchasing fake engagement on the platforms themselves.
Results were delivered in under one day with the exception of Twitter, which sometimes took up to two days. Twitter removed roughly half of the purchased likes and retweets within the timeframe of the study, while Facebook proved the best at identifying inauthentic accounts but not removing content. Instagram and YouTube fell far behind, with YouTube removing none of 100 reported accounts without any explanation. However, YouTube was the most expensive network to purchase engagement on, which is perhaps unsurprising considering that video views on the site can translate directly into ad revenue.
The results are especially eyebrow-raising given that 2020 is a major election year in the US, where the exact impact of widespread social media disinformation campaigns (let alone social media itself) remains a matter of vigorous debate. They also indicate that despite assurances to the contrary, tech firms are doing a terrible job of preventing automated disruption of social media networks.
“We assess that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube are still failing to adequately counter inauthentic behaviour on their platforms,” authors Sebastian Bay and Rolf Fredheim wrote in the report. “Self-regulation is not working. The manipulation industry is growing year by year. We see no sign that it is becoming substantially more expensive or more difficult to conduct widespread social media manipulation.”
“Given the low number of accounts removed, it is clear that social media companies are still struggling to remove accounts used for social media manipulation, even when the accounts are reported to them,” the researchers concluded. “... Even if the market is somewhat chaotic, it functions reasonably well and most orders are delivered in a timely and accurate manner. Social media manipulation remains widely available, cheap and efficient.”
“We spend so much time thinking about how to regulate the social media companies – but not so much about how to regulate the social media manipulation industry,” researcher Sebastian Bay told the Times. “We need to consider if this is something which should be allowed but, perhaps more, to be very aware that this is so widely available.”
“Fake engagement – whether generated by automated or real accounts – can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,” Oxford Internet Institute researcher Samantha Bradshaw added in remarks to the paper. “If these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarisation and distrust that exist within society.”
Experts told Gizmodo in 2018 it is practically impossible to quantify how much of social media is composed of real people versus bots and sock puppet accounts, though all agreed that the percentage was likely in the low double digits.
Companies that specialise in monetising these bot armies largely operate in a legal safe zone, though that is changing. Earlier this year, the New York Attorney General’s office announced a settlement with Devumi LLC, a “follower factory” put on blast by a 2018 Times article, in what it characterised as the first finding by a law enforcement agency that “selling fake social media engagement and using stolen identities to engage in online activity is illegal”. The office said that the firm’s activities violated existing laws prohibiting fraud, false advertising, consumer protection and (when said bots used real people’s photos) identity theft.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thing on your phone you only ever open by accident may soon become a thing you occasionally open on purpose, should you be the owner or potential owner of an electric car. This is thanks to EV charge point specialist Zap-Map adding access to most of its database of chargers via the "OK Google" voice search, making it straightforward to find a charge location without getting done or publically shamed for looking at your phone while driving.
Zap-Map says Android-powered smartphone users are able to use hands-free voice commands to order their telephone to find the nearest EV charge point; and results may then be filtered by charge speed, location, station operator or driving distance, with your virtual assistant also filled in on if the charger is working or out of order for some reason, and suggesting on-route locations if you're already on a satnav mission.
Zap-Map's Ben Lane said: "We are providing a quick and simple way for EV drivers to find out information on charge points at home, on the move and, for the first time ever, hands-free when they most need it -- while driving." [Zap-Map]

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netflix Has Scrapped Its Free 30-Day Trials Because You're a Cheap Arsehole</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix is either making another seemingly anti-consumer move, or there's enough people playing silly buggers to warrant the decision.
The streaming service offers a free 30-day trial to give you a little taste of the goods and - hopefully - get you hooked into dropping that sweet subscription fee every month. But it seems those golden days are over, as the option appears to have disappeared from the website.
Trusted Reviews reports that the free trial is no longer available in the UK, and the only comment Netflix has made so far has been to MoneySavingExpert, saying that existing customers who have already started the trial won't be affected, but no one else is getting in.
The Netflix spokesperson also said that the platform was "looking at different marketing promotions in the UK to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience," but didn't elaborate on what that entails.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has previously demonstrated a fairly laid back approach to people finding ways to avoid paying the sub fees but getting the content anyway - like password sharing, saying it's "something you have to learn to live with."
He apparently did a 180 with the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) - of which Netflix is a member - announcing that it would be working to tackle unauthorised access to content citing “improper password sharing” as an example.
Maybe people were going a bit nuts with free trials on a plethora of email accounts to the point that it's become an issue. Or perhaps the streaming wars means finding more ways to wring cash out of everyone. We've contacted Netflix for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's Finally Ditching Support for Its Explorer Edition of Glass</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Glass will soon receive the final nail in its coffin – as a consumer-marketed product, that is. The company announced this week it’s rolling out one final update to its Glass Explorer Edition. But don’t worry: The wearable’s more industry-focused yet still equally dorky-looking brethren, the Enterprise Edition, will continue receiving support. And so the Google Glass brand lives on. Praise be.
In a recent blog on its support website, Google includes instructions for installing the final update, which has to be done manually, along with some important details about the process moving forward:
“After February 25, 2020, this update removes the need and ability to use your Google account on Glass. It also removes Glass’ connection to backend services. This update is available now and should be installed so you can continue using your device without issues.”
Users will still be able to download the update after this date, but they’ll lose access to apps like YouTube and Gmail in the meantime. And after 25 February, all sign-ins to Glass will require you have the update installed. Google support or not, though, they’re still smart glasses at the end of the day, and so functions like Bluetooth pairing, sideloading apps, as well as taking videos and photos will remain available.
Again, none of this extends to the Enterprise Edition of Glass, the redeveloped and rebranded wearable Google began officially marketing to industry folks like manufacturing workers and medical professionals in 2017. If anything, Google seems to be doubling down on this version, as the company released a second version – Glass Enterprise Edition 2 – earlier this year with a few hardware updates like the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR 1 chipset and a USB-C port.
But just because Google’s Explorer Version of Glass never quite caught on with the casual crowd – whether you want to point the finger at privacy concerns or its buggy launch or the fact that early adopters occasionally got punched in the facefor wearing them (or anything vaguely similar) – that doesn’t mean we can’t imagine all the myriad bad directions Google’s smartglasses could have gone. Had the company continued pushing forward, dead set on turning Glass into the newest consumer tech craze, we might have been cursed with editions akin to Snapchat’s obnoxious Gucci-themed Spectacles by this point.
And so, I’d like to give a short send-off to all the horrible Google Glass ideas that could have been:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amazon is diving ever deeper into healthcare </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The objective of Amazon Transcribe Medical is to makes things easier for developers to integrate medical transcription into applications. These apps will assist physicians do perform clinical documentation more effectively, through automation.
On example of the automation function is to rapidly transcribe physicians’ dictations, plus conversations with patients, into text. The text can be relayed to other applications like Amazon Comprehend Medical, which enables medics to extract medical insights and to assess broader health trends.
The new software has been developed so that it can be embedded into any device or an app through the use of an application programming interface (API). This allows the customer to store it in the electronic medical record.
According to Matt Wood, vice president of artificial intelligence at AWS: “Our overarching goal is to free up the doctor, so they have more attention going to where it should be directed…And that’s to the patient.”
To gain an insight into Amazon’s new venture, Digital Journal spoke with Lux Research analyst Nardev Ramanathan, who tells us: “This system not only allows doctors to dictate into the system, but it can also passively be set to monitor doctor-patient interactions.”
Ramanathan also looks at other technology providers operating in the healthcare space: “Google has also been innovating in this space, launching its own EHR documentation tool that aims to make it easier for doctors to search for a variety of metrics and notes.”
In terms of the implications of these technologies, Ramanathan notes: “These developments will transform the doctor-patient experience, freeing up more time for the doctor to be fully immersed in the provision of care, as opposed to being bogged down with administrative tasks.”
There are, nonetheless, privacy issues to content with. Here Ramanathan cautions: “It is important to also monitor how these technologies are implemented, as extreme accuracy in medical documentation is critical.”
In related news, earlier in 2019 Amazon announced the launch of Amazon Care. This is a service that enables employees to take advantage of virtual doctor consultations and in-home follow-ups, helping to reduce time and provide a more direct service to patients.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chipotle CEO: If employees call in sick, a nurse might make sure they're not faking it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol, when their restaurant workers call in sick, they might have to talk to a nurse to make sure they're not fibbing.
"We have nurses on call, so that if you say, 'Hey, I've been sick,' you get the call into the nurse," CEO Brian Niccol said last week. "The nurse validates that it's not a hangover — you're really sick — and then we pay for the day off to get healthy again."
Later, a Chipotle spokesperson told the New York Post that Niccol's statement wasn't entirely accurate: “You don’t have to call a nurse if you’re taking a sick day... All employees who call off sick for any reason receive paid time off.”
After all, it isn't too tough to feign an illness over the phone.

This time it’s Green Monday, a name invented by eBay more than a decade ago, but which has been adopted by a number of other stores in recent years.
The long and short of it is that if you didn’t find what you were looking for on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or any other day in the past few weeks, now’s another chance to score cheap deals on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other devices.
Here are some of the best deals I’ve found.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pixel feature drops to bring new tricks to Google’s smartphones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are a few key selling points for Google’s Pixel smartphones. They tend to have great cameras. They get security and software updates delivered straight from the company that makes the Android operating system that powers most of the world’s smartphones. And they have some unique features that aren’t widely available on other phones.
From time to time Google also brings new features to its phones via major OS updates or when it rolls out monthly security updates.
But now Google is promising to deliver a pack of new features all at once with “Pixel feature drops.” The first one is set to roll out to Pixel phones this month.
The first update includes a bunch of new features for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones… but it also brings some features that had been elusively available on the Pixel 4 series smartphones to older devices.
For example, the Pixel 3 and 3a are getting support for the Live Caption feature that can provide real-time captions for any video. The Pixel 2 and 2 XL are gaining support for Flip to Shhh, which lets you enable Do Not Disturb by flipping your phone so that it’s face down on a table.
Focus Mode is rolling out to the Digital Wellbeing app for older Pixel devices, giving you the option to pause selected apps with a single tap. And the Recorder app that creates transcripts of voice memos in real-time is now available for older Pixel devices.
Google says it will also bring improvements to memory management to all Pixel devices.
As for the new Pixel 4-exlusive features, Google is bringing:
It’s unclear how often Google will offer Pixel feature drops in the future.
Update: A Google official tells The Verge that the company is “targeting a quarterly cadence” for feature drops.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the tagline ‘Hungry? Face it’, Nets has launched a pilot programme testing facial recognition at a cafeteria in Denamrk.
Around 1,000 people - all working at Vibenshuset, an office community of 25 companies in Copenhagen - can sign up to participate in the pilot, which links their face with their employee ID card to pay for lunch by staring into a screen.Jesper Kildegaard Poulsen, head of Creation Lab, Nets, comments: “We are used to bringing something with us each time we need to make a payment - cash, card or a device. But maybe it doesn’t have to be this way. What if you could pay by just showing up?"How people feel about having their faces scanned is still under question. This trial will help us to learn more about consumer attitudes to facial recognition payments.” He says merchants offering self-service solutions would be the most obvious adopters of facial recognition technology: "Imagine the solution at a burger bar where you are recognised at the self-service counter and asked: ‘Do you want the same meal as last time, Jesper?’ This is where we see the largest potential.”The trial follows an earlier experiment at Copenhagen Business School with biometric vein pattern recognition, which has so far successfully passed 22,000 transactions.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia's Tinkoff is beta-testing a new super-app, combining traditional banking services with lifestyle and leisure features and a marketplace for third party API-based in-app options.
Artem Yamanov, SVP at Tinkoff, comments: “The Tinkoff app has evolved into more than a traditional mobile bank, and the latest changes are the culmination of this transformation. The super-app is both our own version of the App Store, with its own mini apps, and the first WeChat-like app in the Russian or any European financial market, featuring products and services from our partners." Shortly to be publicly released in version 5.0 for iOS, the app offers digital banking services, combined with an array of lifestyle connections for leisure pursuits, an in-app marketplace for products provided by approved third party partners, and end-to-end integration with the bank's robot voice assistant Oleg.The first applications in the marketplace will enable users to make a doctor’s appointment - in both private and public clinics - and sign up for a beauty salon visit.”Going forward, we will be developing partnerships with businesses of any size, from Instagram bloggers to Russia's largest B2C companies," says YamanovTo avoid information overload, the bank is using artificial intelligence to detect user preferences and provide a personalised experience. “Artificial intelligence will be able to predict the user’s needs based on their location, the time of day, recent transactions and many other factors," states Yamanov. "Depending on these variables, it will immediately offer options to suit the customer's needs, saving them time and effort.

The Nintendo Switch is easily one of the coolest gaming devices to be released over the past few years, but it has yet to receive many major deals. Best Buy is changing that – if you get a Nintendo Switch from Best Buy, you’ll get a free $30 gift card. If you think you might need something else from Best Buy (a Switch game, maybe), that basically equates to $30 off.
There are a ton of things that make the Nintendo Switch such an awesome console. For starters, the device offers a range of incredible games, such as the much-loved Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the new Super Smash Bros: Ultimate, and more. It’s safe to say, no matter what genre of gaming you’re into, there should be something for you.
You can play those awesome games in a variety of ways, too. When you’re on the go, you can easily play in handheld mode. Once you get to your living room, you can dock your device to play on the big screen, making for a much more high-end experience. You can even detach the included Joy-Con controllers from the Switch, which helps make the whole experience seamless and enables table-top local multiplayer wherever you are.
Considering the lack of Switch deals we’ve seen so far, this is one of the best deals you’re likely to get.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to change your screen resolution in Windows 10 to customize your display, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Whether you’re playing a game, visiting a website that looks better in a certain resolution, or you simply prefer your computer screen to have a particular layout, Windows 10 allows you to customize your screen resolution to your liking.
While the standard and recommended screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels, there are actually 16 resolutions to choose from based on your personal preference.
Changing your screen resolution in Windows 10 can be done via the Display Settings option on your computer. From there, you can try out each of the offered resolutions to see which one best suits your needs, and you can follow the same steps again at any time to change it back.
Here’s how to do it.
1. Click the Windows button in the lower-left hand side of your screen.
2. In the search box, type “display.”
3. Click “Display settings” to open the app.
4. In the Display screen, scroll down to the “Scale and layout” section.
5. Click the box under “Display resolution” to see your available options.
6. Click on the screen resolution you want, then either click “Revert” or “Keep changes.”
It should also be noted that you can change your screen layout from landscape to portrait or vice versa under the same “Scale and layout” section depending on your needs or preferences.
These options may only be available on certain machines, so if certain resolutions or layout options do not appear, this is because they’re not compatible with your device.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chase has a diverse lineup of credit cards, including options that earn cash back, more premium cards that earn Ultimate Rewards points, hotel and airline cards, and business credit cards.
If you have a Chase credit card or debit card, you could be eligible for Chase Offers. These deals get you cash back on purchases with a variety of retailers and restaurants once you add the offer to your card. Keep reading to see how it works, and what kind of offers you can expect to find.
Keep in mind that we’re focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It’s important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.
Chase Offers are deals available to select holders of Chase credit and debit cards. These offers get you cash back at a variety of retailers, from Rite Aid to New Balance to Starbucks.
Chase Offers generally get you cash back in the form of a percentage. For example, on my Chase Sapphire Reserve account I currently see an offer for 10% back at Blue Apron, with a $19 maximum. However, some offers get you a flat cash-back amount, such as $7 back at Stitch Fix.
Each Chase Offer has an expiration date – in your account this will be displayed as how many days you have left to use it. Keep this date in mind, since you won’t be eligible for cash back if you don’t make a purchase in time.
To use a Chase Offer, you need to add it to your card account – you can do so by simply clicking on it. Then, you just make a qualifying purchase while the offer is still valid with your Chase card, and you’ll receive the cash back as a statement credit to your account.
Keep in mind that not every Chase cardholder will see Chase Offers associated with their account. For example, I have five Chase accounts (including both debit and credit), and I only see offers associated with three of them.

Here are some Chase Offers that are currently available. Keep in mind that you may see different deals in your own account. Additionally, some of these offers may no longer be available, though this list will be updated on a regular basis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Exclusive: PR software firm exposes data on nearly 500k contacts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written by Greg OttoDec 9, 2019 | CYBERSCOOP
A company that sells content management software and services exposed data on 477,000 media contacts, including 35,000 hashed user passwords, to the public internet.
In October, iPRsoftware, a U.S.-based company that specializes in software that manages and disseminates company public relations and marketing, was discovered to be exposing the data along with administrative system credentials and assorted documents.
Among the documents were marketing materials for client companies, as well as credentials for the company’s Google and Twitter accounts and a MongoDB hosting provider. A MongoDB spokesperson told CyberScoop that the database was hosted by Compose IBM.
“This is a sunset third-party service that was never owned or maintained in any way by MongoDB Inc.,” the spokesperson said.
Chris Vickery, director of cyber risk research at UpGuard, first contacted the company about the exposure in October. Despite the company’s acknowledgement of the issue, Vickery observed that over the next week, the only thing that changed was the appearance of a log file for the purpose of reviewing activity related to the open repository.
When contacted weeks later by CyberScoop about the exposure, a company representative said it was in touch with Amazon Web Services about the issue. AWS told iPRsoftware that the repository was in fact exposed to the public internet, and the company made it private on Nov. 26.
iPRSoftware lists NVIDIA, Xerox and Mattel among its clients. Among the companies with information exposed included Nasdaq and Mercury Public Affairs, a lobbying firm that stirred up controversy earlier this year for its ties to Paul Manafort.
iPRSoftware did not respond to questions on whether it had informed its clients of the data exposure.
The exposure shows how third-party risk expands when enterprises need businesses to grasp how to secure the information they are entrusted with.
“The consequences of compromised credentials to social media accounts are well known and can result in blatant defacement or surreptitious private messaging,” Vickery writes in a blog post. “While digital advertising is the core revenue stream for platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, businesses use their online presence to market to customers by distributing information about their products and gathering contact information from potential customers. … When made public, the result is the exposure of information for hundreds of thousands of people attached to or targeted by PR and marketing efforts.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written by Kelly ShortridgeDec 9, 2019 | CYBERSCOOP
Editor’s Note: It seems like the entire cybersecurity sector has something to say about what the future holds for 2020. But what do the computers themselves think? Kelly Shortridge, VP of product strategy at Capsule8, forced a bot to read more than 1,000 cyber security predictions for 2020 and then asked it to write predictions of its own. Here is the result. The article is all generated through Markov chains and is only super lightly edited for clarity.
The year 2020 indicates more years. The year 2020 expects to showcase more budgets and detecting weird things and anomalies. 2020 will very likely bring a greater risk. There is a lot of skepticism that has existed for years, but in 2020 we will have to consider that top security conferences could lead to even disasters based on the activities of ‘undesirable’ individuals.
Looking forward, 2020 promises to be the easiest vector of attack vectors. Rather than trying to gaze into a crystal ball, research firm IDC estimated that hackers are important to us. It is just a matter of time before some attackers don’t care.
Technological advances in AI and machine learning will offset increasing cloud expertise. Deep fakes will ransomware targets in the Cloud. Nations will need to understand DevOps software development and adoption of AI as part of their digital transformation and propaganda. Large scale, multi-vector Gen Z cyber attacks will make headline news and cast doubt on the private industry. Data will consolidate and extend their spheres of influence.
Don’t be chilled by what you don’t know. You ain’t cybersecurity.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the continued reliance on traditional security practices.”
When exactly did cybersecurity with AI in enterprises today? The year 2020 expects to see an increase in the preventative approach of deep learning environments, which will become outdated and dangerous. TTPs will continue to evolve cyber threats; we’ll fight AI with AI. Drones hovering outside office windows will discuss ML and AI to combat the threat landscape. These AI will announce a strike over Twitter, the first monumental disruption in 2020.
Real-time data and analytics and machine learning and AI creates unpreparedness by corporations and Big Tech companies. Managed detection engines are built on human made logic, but keeping this up-to-date against the latest studies costs almost three million cyber security. Perhaps the most attention raised by increasingly employed AI-based solutions is our need to reconsider our notions of what makes a mistake.
Our lives will continue to escalate, and so will the steady migration of AI algorithms to become more money. Companies should encourage their teams to lift their maturity and look for modern ways of doing things, such as leveraging AI to implement solutions that help attackers. However, AI won’t only enable malware, but also dramatically be a harbinger for the cyberthreat landscape. AI will move undetected across complex digital infrastructure (CI) and open doors to threats.
Scammers will continue to be one of the most difficult problems to tackle and will use more sophisticated techniques, like AI, to break into well-protected systems. Without any packaged-up, off-the-shelf solutions to help detect these ever-growing AI and ML solutions, adversaries will make huge progress. With AI, the same adversary could target 20 companies and add billions of interesting cybersecurity regulations. This topic will command headlines month after month, and unfortunately, we will be worse for it.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the continuing educated guesses based on artificial intelligence.”
In 2020, the ever-popular cloud-based, resilient architecture comes into focus. Every year irrespective, any reduction in transportation, energy, defense, aerospace, healthcare, manufacturers, enterprises will have to continue because it will become the cloud offerings. The Cloud Continues to be a promising service.
2020 will see the continued integration of digital transformation. They must be diligent in ensuring they protect their systems, especially moving to the Cloud as part of their digital transformational.
Preventing cloud compromises will require a cross-generational blend of multilayered and connected defense powered by security mechanisms such as the DevelOps. Companies are not synchronized with the DevOps. Security of their workloads in the cloud remains low. Any given cloud at any given time has at least 14 zero-day attacker-controlled lightbulbs (they make them blink SOS in Morse code).
Typical Public Cloud accessible systems are complex and esoteric. Everything is more computers. The Cloud continues to be the easiest vectors that present new wrinkles. The smallpox of cybersecurity is very fragmented, meaning across multiple clouds. That’s something we also believe is probably being overlooked. Unfortunately, most companies maintain both on-prem and cloud environments.
DevOps will increase as sophisticated attacks hit the on-prem world. The year 2020 will be for those who can match the needs of various groups who compromise the DevOps pipeline. 53% of security workers report that their team’s understanding of DevOps software development was largely thought of as a linear progression. Unfortunately, there will be a rise of New Zero-Day Exploits that result in the steady migration of digital transformational benefits.
When ubiquitous, the Google Cloud will create a virtually insurmountable layer of compliance. API keys will be floating around our neighborhoods, office buildings, and other public spaces. A new breed of data at scale. In the near-term, the threat is the array of consumer data being released into the DevOps pipeline. Business Email Spoofing has previously cried wolf with allegations of data on the cloud. In 2020 and beyond, they will continue to deploy DevOps build/release/run technology, which leaves them vulnerability. In order for us to defend, we need to insert the security realm, quantum communications, in containers.
Criminal organizations will adopt a cloud-first approach. Too many organizations, including APT33, APT34, and TEMP.Zagros, will shift strategies to adopting integrated intelligence into the DevOps process. For example, the abuse of packages and libraries that use cloud service literature. This model cashes in on the wide attack surface for misconfigurations, observing anomalous behavior within cloud applications in that old medium known as “smoke and mirrors.”
And it’s a matter of time before some attackers draw the line by avoiding DevSecOps. According to the FBI, businesses have lost $26 billion in the past few years. This is due, in part, to the global adoption of DevSecOps and shapeshifting. It will have profound implications for the good guys; we cannot let the bad guys have the sophisticated movements and contemporaneous event streams. One estimates up to 95% of compromising situations are due to DevSecOps. There’s no end in sight for this crisis.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the continuation of the evolution in cloud security.”
In 2020, we will likely develop new and more connected things in 2020. Gone are the days of networks isolated behind a company firewall and a limited stack of enterprise IoT devices. There are many IoT devices, smart homes, and more devices becoming connected. As this is a well-established backdoor into our lives, we must see a steady growth of IoT-related attacks. We have already.
State-sponsored botnets of compromise will increase. In 2020, we expect to see nation state military cyber operations against cryptography, which will become a necessity for all aspects of malicious activity in the IoT network. Governments and the nation-state groups may seek opportunity for compromised devices like smart TVs and speakers to snoop on data access requests (DARs) remotely. We expect to see state actors looking to transfer large amounts of information on those devices to stream videos or host malware on a computer every 39 seconds on average.
We believe industrial processes will be used to install malicious activity in the name of innovation without loss of control. Smart buildings and smart cities will more than double to nearly $2.1 billion, according to Gartner. Connected buildings will account for 81% of all connected things in the nation.
Incomplete or defective patches can be bypassed to exploit IoT security sensors, intelligent streetlights, and smart meters with modified firmware. For sensitive leaks, for instance, someone could pose as an electrician to gain physical and cyber.
Our prediction around OT cybersecurity is that drone-based network attacks will continue in 2020. Drones equipped with specially fitted hardware and software and hardware and software platforms or systems may be parked on the roof of a building’s OT system. Drones equipped with a device like a WiFi Pineapple can be placed in proximity to a targeted company for exploitation of a previously undisclosed vulnerabilities in containers. The future holds so many possibility.
Because of all the threats, there’s a huge market for counterfeit components and cloned products, increasing the threat of using ‘defense in depth’ – multiple layers of controls where staff are locked out of their computers. Expect to see demand for new information security fatigue as more and cheaper chips and components drive booming business. While we can expect the shift from legacy CPU architecture, we anticipate there will be cyberattacks on these next-gen processors
Microprocessors
Microprocessors
Microprocessors.
Be aware of it pioneering the all data lifecycle. It’s time I gather the smart cities.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the only way to monetizing IoT network attacks.”
The newest cellular standard, 5G, is rolling out across the world in response to the global success of the cyber arms race. The year 2020 will see a rise in the adoption of 5G, however, it may end up being the catalyst for a radical paradigm shift to unprecedented data theft. Gartner estimates at least 40% of IoT-created data is now stored, processed and analyzed to create many victims at 5G speeds. With the advent of 5G, even more data will be carried out to eavesdrop, take control of, and even passports.
5G tech is so important because it will deliver blows slowly, stealthily, and virtually. Both cell towers and Wi-Fi access points could increase sophisticated criminal scams such as GDP. The CEOs of Amazon, AT&T, Dell, IBM, and others will conceal locations more than ever before. The bandwidths that 5G enables will drive espionage in situations, once autonomous functionality provides a reasonable amount of time to execute codes. Nations will need to adapt accordingly.
Ultra-fast 5G networks across all industry should never be exposed to the public internet. The more reliable connectivity and lower latency will work in the favor of determined attackers wishing to transfer exponential gains in IT security or privacy. Imagine being able to download a 2-hour malware in less than one minute. We’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg.
Data volumes skyrocket with 5G – talk is up about 150% in 2019 alone. Basically, this has generally incremental improvements in speed and evolution. However, this is not without cost or risk. We should expect to see new types of “voishing” attacks, making voice a new weapon of choice. Imagine receiving an urgent call or voicemail from your “boss,” asking to steal customers. As a result, we are going to see a lot more voice-related attacks in regions that lie along the trade routes between Asia and Europe.
It’s possible that we will see changes to legislation. Nevertheless, readiness.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the cohesion of 5G wireless to malfunction a nationwide digital.”
In 2020, autonomous vehicles (AV) will be brought to a standstill. The year 2020 expects to see an increase in their use of this threat. Cyberattacks causing cars to malfunction are not off limits to foot and vehicle traffic. Unfortunately, wireless vehicle communicated to both cell towers and to Wi-Fi access points located through phone calls with spoofed accents and vocal patterns bypass standard security ecosystems.
Recent Ponemon research has found that nearly 20% of organizations rolling out a luxury car with sharing of privileged accounts lose control through simple misconfigurations. Wireless vehicle controls will be corrupted or poisoned with malicious third parties who wish to provide a reasonable amount of leaked data. Flaws and weaknesses involving the deserialization of untrusted data will be a major concern, particularly in enterprise applications, like Grindr, used directly by vehicle-based systems.
Strength in cyber security buzzwords will also be used to install malicious malware on systems or could turn the engine off while driving at high speed. In the next few years, once autonomous vehicles become more prevalent in account takeover, attackers could turn the engine off while driving to elections. Still, connected to the internet of Things (IoT), we will also see other cyberattacks causing cars to malfunction before they lose control rapidly. The same exact concern applies to other autonomous or connected vehicles, such as trucks, trains and airplanes, which could in turn create a negative feedback cycle.
As autonomous trucking becomes more widespread, interest among cybercriminals will become so damaging that the FBI will soften its stance on paying ransoms. Likewise, they may struggle with Niels Bohr, the leader of the criminal operation of long-haul trucking. IT teams alike should be helping isolate digital vehicle hijacking, and even interrupt or disable autonomous cargo trucks. The security of connected cars and autonomous trucking will become more widespread by forging elements – for instance, the usage of cyber spotlight.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the re-emergence of some spectacular car crash synergies.”
The year 2020 will be the ransomware attacks. Research has shown that the threat is the ‘ignorance’ – which is cryptocurrency. With the decline of cryptocurrency accounts, attackers will make use of the established banking community. New online banking and payment data would now be wielded by an adversary activity. One thing’s for certain – illegal fees as well as rewards will join forces. Despite its soaring revenues, it must rebuild a damaged customer base.
Ransomware’s efficacy is, by-and-large, due to its speed – it can simply move faster than society’s ability to deal with their ethics. Society has become an afterthought, leaving major vulnerabilities for self-driving cars, remote robotic surgeries, and human bodies. However, the next-generation of society reduces the barriers to entry for the new wave of cyber criminals. We’ll start to suck a little less.
Our prediction is that 2020’s next attack is novel and may be a harbinger for unspecified targeted ransomware. Recently, untargeted “shotgun blast” ransomware has plateaued with attackers showing preference for targeted attacks using of deepfakes. Insider threat intelligence operations teams will create dedicated executives in remote locations that lie within the Darknet to conceal their operations.
The widespread ransomware cases that have grown in intensity over the past year demonstrates that 53% of these accounts impersonate an identity (human or non-human) via DeepFake technology. These attacks will become commoditized, highly disruptive attacks that will seek to bypass all of the security outcomes. Even the typical spray and pray ransomware authors will most likely prepare for them.
Cyber-criminal attempts to use ransomware threatening industrial machine learning to combat supply chain for computers and tablets will be on the rise. Attackers will start discovering more UEFI malware and put up for sale on the dark web, their malware families competing for dominance. Ransomware in Linux infrastructure that was brought about by the public will immediately be made private. We’ve seen extremely virulent strains of this malware present unique challenges of security programs to develop security metrics to track success and provide meaningful reports to the board.
The audit side of this threat is where APT tools all look alike and TTPs can be identical twins or family members. Organizations will look to the same failed strategic collaboration and actively lay the blame on someone else. And we will continue to see the rise of cyber insurance industries whose business model is to cash in on the wide attack surface.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the continued reliance on userland malware and living off the land.”
In 2020, we expect to properly understand how we realized that we are terrible. Political adversaries will look for a reality. It will be fake news 2.0. Drones hovering outside office windows will hijack a Bluetooth mouse to silently install malware on systems to tally who is our next president. We will all be waiting breathlessly long after the final vote has been tallied to learn if the U.S. has suffered a social media.
The effort put into continuously generating a sense of chaos and attempting to discredit candidates and push inaccurate political process is the primary threat to democracy. It’s very likely that we will see an increase in the targeting of state and local voter databases with a goal of creating voting havoc and triggering voter fraud, potentially undermining leadership for our next slate of elected representatives.
Cyber operatives allegedly attempted a cyber operatives allegedly attempted a cyber operatives allegedly attempted a cyber operations against voters and coffee.
Election hacking has implications of Russian interference in US elections. In 2016, the U.S. suffered a breach of about 383 million key decisions, creating serious havoc. Russian-speaking APT (advance persistent threats (APTs) will continue to escalate, so there will be no turning back the clock. However, regulators will protect the 2020 election – forcing the sieges of all the world to snoop on the globe. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will drive urgency. The BRI is a large-scale breach.
As a result, traditional playbooks stipulate geopolitical conflicts are now more expensive. The next generations present opportunity for threat actors to refine cyber operations. Nation-state cyber units will increase the use of AI to analyze defense mechanisms and tailor attacks to specific weak areas. Nation-state programs use the same 1-day exploits, often deploying off of a rival’s infrastructures for proxy conflicts. Introducing a second factor does add a layer of complexity in the context of ongoing armed conflict. A failure can enable a multiple nation collision after at least 14 exploits.
In 2020, we will see U.S. forces create synergies by blending cyber operations. The problem is that attackers will exfiltrate non-conventional military force in response to a cyber attack on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory. However, due to the sustained outage, law enforcement will be forced to quell looting and rioting when a cyber attack hits us in the past (with “20/20 hindsight”). U.S. citizens will riot due to their own VPN services more than ever before. Yes, all this sounds futuristic, but it is devastating in scope and capability.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the disinformation factories and data refineries.”
In 2020, major corporations will collect information security officers. A recent survey has shown that some may require decision-makers and coffee to see what we do as security in 2020. However, CISO job descriptions lack a critical skill set – the ability to bring strategic value to an organizations. The CISO must answer when the board asks, “Are we secure? Are we doing the right skillsets to combat this threat?”
Enterprise executives will be concentrating their budgets – 69% of cybersecurity budgets have increased by 141% from 2010 to 2018 – and the C-suite will find themselves in a dual predicament. Research will conduct an airstrike on Chief Data Officers (CDOs), causing much heartburn for CISOs. Without equally fast defenses in place, no one will withstand the power of swarm-based attacks against CIOs and CISOs. It’s less to do with replacing bodies and more about the organization’s wallet.
There is a shortage of resources who truly understand the sensitive data. The shortage of cyber experts will continue to use slow and patchy coffee shop Wi-Fi connections. In 2020, IT security is not going to have any chance to pause and think. As a result, we foresee demand for more and more organizational frameworks. Version 1.0 of the framework will be available in cities and countries around the world. CISOs will have to establish plausible deniability and focus on modeling.
In 2020, packaged-up, off-the-shelf solutions will increasingly complex cybersecurity fatigue. 2020 will see an ever-increasing amounts of information and event management and IT monitoring. A next-generational burden for SOC employees will entail the SOC’s new encyclopedia: MITRE ATT&CK. The CISO will not be safe from the growing nightmare. Basically, cybersecurity is an authoritative government of water-witching.
CIOs and CISOs will need to be cognizant that they could be the cause of users still using silly and insecure passwords, because the industry has finally realized that we are terrible at validating online identities. For 2020, the CISO role will continue to increase the use of socially-engineered cyber impersonation as an identity. A CISO really needs to mean more than an insider threat. Sean predicts CISOs and CISOs will be anti-virus software supplier auditing systems.
CIOs and CISOs will build influence and emissaries, and have teachable moments to bring everybody around to understand the similarities and differences, focusing on pain and the tedious work. For 2020, they will establish common ground: good data stewardship across the board. Consumer backlash makes privacy slip-ups and accidental disclosures catastrophic security incidents – and we expect that to continue into 2020.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the continued reliance on data when making key decisions that have broader societal implications.”
Humans suck at security and data protection. We rely on them. Accordingly, enterprises must race to lock all of the security. Nothing is more difficult to do.
Finally, this blog only exists for space programs and disruption.
We should cite Clausewitz’s dictum, “War is merely the marketing, deployed.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Canon EOS R Mark II is Already in Testing, Announcement at Photokina: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Canon’s got big plans for 2020. According to the most recent reports, the company will release not one but two new full-frame mirrorless cameras in the first half of next year: the ultra-high-resolution Canon EOS Rs we reported on last week, and the EOS R Mark II.
This news about Canon’s EOS R Mark II comes from our friends at Canon Rumors, who are being told that the second iteration of Canon’s EOS R is already being tested by “a small group of Canon professionals,” and is expected to be released at Photokina 2020 in May. This news seems to track with the statement that Canon shared with Photokina last week, in which the company said that it “is eager to introduce new products and concept products at photokina, thereby contributing to the industry’s success.”
The Canon EOS R has only been around for a little over a year, which would make this Mark II release a much faster update than most of us expected. But according to CR’s source, the EOS R Mark II is definitely in the works and will “closely mimic” the design of the Canon EOS Rs, which is expected to launch as soon as February with a 75MP image sensor, dual card slots, and more.
That’s all we know so far, as the source declined to share any specs (yet), but it doesn’t look like Canon is content to sit on its laurels where the RF mount is concerned. For better or worse, the company will try to compete with Sony step-for-step in the full-frame mirrorless market, including with the company’s aggressive camera release schedule.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sugar Bytes has found its groove again and released DrumComputer, a new plugin that specialises in synthetic beats.
You get eight individual sound engines, each of which has its own channel and can call on three distinct synthesis layers: Resonator, Wavetable and Resynth.
There are numerous effects and modulation possibilities, too, along with intelligent randomisation options that can create individual sounds and complete kits for you.
These sounds can be turned into patterns in the feature-packed 16-step/16-pattern sequencer, and there are modulation sequencers as well. When you’ve got a beat that you’re happy with you can drag and drop it as MIDI, with all relevant pattern information being transported across.
DrumComputer is also designed for live use. Sounds can be assigned to your keyboard and you can set up key zones for rolls, pitch and modulations. You can also trigger mutes, enabling live rearranging, or switch between patterns to create longer performances.
To get you started, DrumComputer ships with more than 400 global presets and 450 engine presets, but really, the creative possibilities look to be pretty much endless. It’s available now for PC and Mac in VST/AU/AAX formats priced at €119 - you can find out more and download a demo on the Sugar Bytes website.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new Bioshock game is officially in the works. Announced by 2K earlier today, the new title is being developed by a new internal studio dubbed Cloud Chamber.
While official news of a new game has been well-received, it seems like we’ll be waiting a while to see the fruit of cloud chamber’s labours. In a press release issued earlier today, the publisher confirmed that the new game “will be in development for the next several years.” Speaking to IGN, studio head Kelley Gilmore said that the developer is at “the earlier end of our process.”
A statement from 2K president David Ismalier confirms that the main pillars of the series - powerful narrative and FPS gameplay - will return in its latest iteration. There’s no word, however, on when or where the new game will be set, or whether it will be a direct sequel or a reboot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Provable Things launch pTokens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">pTokens, the world’s first token to enable decentralized finance interoperability between any blockchain, cryptocurrency or token 
5th December TBC: Provable Things (previously Oraclize), the world’s first and most widely adopted blockchain oracle for modern decentralized applications (DApps), has today launched pTokens. 
pTokens are an industry-first solution that will unlock cross-chain liquidity for the entire $250+ billion cryptocurrency market by making Decentralized Finance (DeFi) universally compatible with every cryptocurrency or blockchain platform, including leading networks Ethereum, Bitcoin and EOS. 
pTokens are the first tool to enable the use of a cryptocurrency across multiple blockchain networks for all DApps and the high growth DeFi industry. pTokens now make these new, powerful applications accessible to anyone using cryptocurrencies for alternative finance, without having to sell their Bitcoin, EOS or any other cryptocurrency they hold. 
DeFi is the concept of recreating traditional financial instruments such as loans and interest-accounts in a decentralized architecture, outside of centralized control. DeFi is a rapidly growing industry, yet its liquidity cannot accommodate the constant flow of new tools and platforms when development is spread thinly across multiple blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. 
DApp’s – applications that run on distributed computing networks – have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. The majority of this nascent industry is built upon – and thus limited to – the Ethereum network however, which makes hundreds of DeFi DApps inaccessible to non-Ethereum crypto holders. This is what pTokens will solve. 
pTokens are minted at a one-to-one ratio for the currency that is being converted. This means that one pToken will always be worth one of the underlying staked crypto, also known as being ‘pegged’ to it. So ownership of an existing cryptocurrency token such as EOS, is held by its pToken equivalent, pEOS. Andthat pEOS token can then be converted back to EOS, 1:1 at its current value and at any time. This eliminates the need to sell currencies, a taxable event, in order to engage with Ethereum based applications. 
Users of the EOS token will be the first community to have access to the advantages of pTokens, with this initial release bringing the EOS token to Ethereum in the form of a standard ERC20 token. The newly minted pEOS tokens provide EOS-users instant and frictionless access to the world of DeFi by making the EOS token compatible with the Ethereum network. The conversion from EOS to pEOS takes place within a cryptographically secure, fully auditable and transparent environment. 
For now the pEOS pToken is the bridge between Ethereum and EOS, but pTokens can support any blockchain asset. New pTokens such as pBTC, pETH and pDAI will soon be available. 
Provable Things A London-based business operating within the blockchain industry, Provable Things, née Oraclize was founded in 2015. Provable uses cutting-edge decentralized and Trusted Computing technologies to provide services for modern DApps, enabling the shift of traditional services into the decentralized economy. The first Provable product to launch has become the longest-running blockchain oracle service industry-wide, granting a reliable connection between smart contracts and Web APIs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you were thinking of heading to Moogfest next year, you’re going to have to change your plans; the bad news is that it’s been cancelled.
Originally scheduled to take place on 16 to 19 April 2020, Moog cites “logistical reasons” for the cancellation, but does suggest that the event - which is part tech conference, part festival - will return in the future.
“This intermission will be used to focus on the future of Moogfest and to investigate new ways of exploring the future of music, art, and technology,” the company wrote on its blog. Those who pre-purchased their Moogfest tickets will be entitled to a refund.
Of course, one other side effect of this cancellation is that we won’t get the traditional ‘Moogfest synth’ that those who sign up for the regular Engineer Workshop get the chance to build and keep. Previous instruments have included the Mother-32, DFAM and Spectravox.
You can read the full statement on the Moog blog.

There was a major problem with the previous Ubuntu images though -- a kernel bug prevented USB ports from working on the 4GB RAM model of the Raspberry Pi 4. A temporary workaround was proposed, but Canonical has finally fixed the flaw, and made updated 32 and 64-bit images of Ubuntu available for the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and 4, which you can download now.
Announcing the new images, Galem KAYO, Product Manager for Ubuntu Core at Canonical, says:
Canonical plans to deliver Ubuntu Server LTS and Ubuntu Core to Raspberry Pi in the future and aims to make an officially supported image of Ubuntu available for each new model of Pi.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amazon is getting free access to NHS medical data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As fear mounts in the UK at the prospect of the NHS being sold in part or in whole to the US, the government has decided to give Amazon access to National Health Service data for free.
The arrangement means that Amazon will be able to access "healthcare information, including ... symptoms, causes, and definitions". The tech giant will be able to use the data in conjunction with Alexa to enable users to get medical help and advice via the digital assistant.
Although individual patient data will not be shared, the deal is still highly controversial. Back in July, the UK government announced that it was going in to partnership with Amazon, and this immediately raised concerns. Campaigners from Privacy International used a freedom of information request to obtain a copy of a contract between Amazon and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHCS) from December last year.
The document reveals that Amazon will be able to access and make use of all of the DHCS's "healthcare information, including without limitation symptoms, causes, and definitions, and all related copyrightable content, data, information and other materials". No money is changing hands as part of the deal.
Amazon will be able to use the data to create "new products, applications, cloud-based services and/or distributed software", and is also permitted to share the information with third parties. While an NHS spokesperson says, "no patient data is being provided to this company by the NHS, which takes data privacy extremely seriously and has put appropriate safeguards in place to ensure information is used correctly", Privacy International is still concerned.
Writing about the documents it was able to obtain, Privacy International says:
The privacy and rights group calls for greater transparency. Large portions of the documents obtained were redacted, making it hard to determine the precise details of what has been agreed -- something which is worrying considering the value and nature of the data involved.
Amazon is trying to calm fears, saying: "General health-related content from the NHS website is now available to Alexa users via voice technology. The new option is particularly useful for those with accessibility needs who may not have been able to easily access nhs.uk content via a mobile device or computer in the past".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we’ve previously reported last week, realme had announced of expanding its product range to include devices such as wearables and true wireless audio. Debuting soon in Indian markets, the company revealed its first ever true wireless earbuds, the realme Buds Air
At first glance, the realme Buds Air sports a design that’s somewhat similar to Apple Airpods and Huawei Freebuds. According to the official website, the true wireless earbuds is available in three colour choices: Black, Yellow, and White.
Hardware-wise, the earbuds supports instant pairing via Bluetooth 5.0 which allows it to automatically connect to your smart device once you open its charging case – provided that you’ve already paired both devices prior to this, of course. Other than that, the Buds Air also features a 12mm bass boost driver in each earbud, touch controls for music and hands-free calls, and one-touch activation for Google Assistant. realme has not disclosed any information on its battery life, or other features and specifications.
The Buds Air will be launched alongside the brand’s new realme XT 730G smartphone on 17 December in India. realme has yet to reveal the true wireless earbuds’ pricing, and has not confirmed any plans for a global release at this time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sony PlayStation 5 Pro Reportedly Possible In Next Console Lifecycle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Come next year, Sony will officially be launching its next-generation PlayStation 5 (PS5) console, thus resetting the console generation once again. Recently though, the Japanese electronics corporation suggested that a “Pro” version of the PS5 is likely to happen sometime in the console’s lifecycle.
The topic about the possibility of a PS5 Pro came up during an interview between Game Informer and Masayasu Ito, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s (SIE) Executive VP of Hardware Engineering and Operation. During the conversation, Ito spoke at length as to how – due to the speed at which technology is advancing today – console lifecycles now sit between a period of six and seven years.
Ito continues to explain that because of the advancement speed, Sony should be able to “change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancement in technology”. Such is the case of the PS4 Pro; basically a souped-up version of the original PS4, the PS4 Pro arrived on to the scene in 2016, bringing with it improved hardware that supported 4K gaming, among other features.
This isn’t the first time that the idea of the PS5 Pro has manifest online. Several months ago, the Japanese journalist, Zenji Nishikawa alleged that Sony was planning on launching the PS5 Pro alongside the non-Pro version of the console. That said, there’s not a whole lot of information to back up Nishikawa’s statement, so it’s best to take his claims with a dash of salt.
In any case, we’ll just have to wait until the end of 2020 to find out what’s in store for us all.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TSMC To Kick Off 5nm Mass Production Mid-2020; 3nm To Start In 2022</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this year, TSMC announced that it had completed the fabrication process of its upcoming 5nm die lithography. Now, the Taiwan-based foundry recently announced that it is ready to go into mass production with its new process sometime in the middle of next year.
As per our earlier report, TSMC’s new 5nm process will be aimed at SoC designs, the emerging 5G connectivity and adoption, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing applications. Statistically speaking, the new process is expected to deliver 1.8 times the logic density of the currently existing ARM Cortex-A72 processor.
Despite it not being commercially available just yet, TSMC already has a client lining up for its 5nm process nodes. At the start of 2018, Apple announced that it had helped the foundry construct its 5nm fabrication plant. Meaning that the Cupertino giant will have first dibs on the TSMC’s first batch of chips once they become available in 2020.
On another note, TSMC also mentioned that it is also on track with its development and production of its 3nm process node in the year 2022. It’s a bit of good news, but also unsurprising when you consider that the foundry is already preparing to break ground for a new facility for said process.

Disney+ price: $6.99 US / $8.99 AU and CA / €6.99 NL / £Unknown UK
Disney+ launch date: November 12, 2019 (US), March 31, 2020 (UK)
Disney+ movies studios: Disney, Marvel, Fox, Pixar, LucasFilm
Disney+ app selection: Android devices, Apple devices, Chromecast, PS4, Xbox One, Roku, Web browser, Nintendo Switch
Disney+ sign-up:Start watching now
Disney Plus (or Disney+), the biggest new streaming service of 2019, is now up and running in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand – with plenty more countries joining in in the months ahead.
To get you right up to speed on everything Disney Plus, we've written this comprehensive, authoritative guide explaining everything worth knowing about the hot new platform: from the shows you can expect to see to the apps you can use to watch them.
What's more, we're going to give you some pointers for getting your hands on the best Disney+ subscription deal as well, so you can start your streaming right away at the lowest possible prices.
At this point it seems that all the hype and buzz Disney has built up about its new service seems to be working – a recent survey showed that nearly two-thirds of those polled said they had already signed up for Disney+, or that they would be doing so in the near future.
Whether you need to know about the Disney Plus apps, or which content you can get in 4K, or the Disney+ shows and movies that it includes (covering a wealth of Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Simpsons content), this page has everything you need to get right up to speed on the new Netflix killer.
It's certainly impossible to dispute the stellar movie and TV show selection provided by Disney Plus: it's currently offering hundreds upon hundreds of fantastic blockbusters and much-see shows to watch, and they're all available on demand once you start your subscription.
If you've got Disney Plus questions, we've got Disney Plus answers, as part of this comprehensive guide: if you want to know "what does Disney Plus include?", "how much does Disney Plus cost?", "when can I sign up for Disney Plus?", "which Disney Plus channels do I get?", "what devices run Disney Plus?" or anything else, then you're in exactly the right place.
Firstly and most importantly though, we start with the very best Disney Plus deals available at launch.
Disney+ | $6.99 per monthDisney Plus on its own costs a very affordable $6.99 per month, and as part of the initial sign-up deal you get a 7-day free trial, too. This grants you access to all the movies and TV show content that Disney Plus has to offer.VIEW DEAL
Disney+ | Hulu | ESPN+ | $12.99 per monthThis is the best launch bundle deal available for Disney+, delivering the hot new streaming service along with full access to Hulu and ESPN+ for just $12.99 per month. That's thousands of movies, TV shows, channels and live sports events, for one affordable price point. Indeed, when you consider that the standard Netflix plan costs $12.99 per month on its own, and delivers none of the Hulu or ESPN+ content, as well as a fraction of the Disney programming, the stunning value of this deal really becomes evident.VIEW DEAL
Buy Google Chromebook | Get 3 months of Disney+ free | Available now at GoogleHead on over to Google's online store right now and buy a Chromebook and you get 3 months of Disney+ for free. Systems start from just $179 and there are a wide selection of makers to choose from, including HP, Lenovo and ASUS.VIEW DEAL
If you're considering signing up for Disney Plus, bear in mind that not only do you get a huge amount of content right from the off, but also that Disney is pulling its shows and movies off other services – so a Netflix or Prime account might not be as valuable as you previously thought.
Going through all the classic Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and Simpsons content on the service, it's clear that this is a library of original programming that's hard to top: it seems very much like Disney Plus is quickly going to become the streaming service that people sign up to first (and cancel last). 
Indeed, Disney+ is already very well priced, with the service available on its own for around half of what a standard Netflix subscription costs. Add in all the extra value you get for the whole family, and it seems like the obvious first-choice subscription service for many users.
If you need to take a break at any stage, that's no problem either: you can cancel Disney Plus at any point through the website, through the Settings app in iOS, or through the Google Play Store app in Android. As with Netflix, you can stop and restart your subscription at any time.
After one or two technical hiccups, Disney Plus is now live in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand, having launched across the 12-19 November 2019: in the US, it's available to subscribers for $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year. That compares quite well with Netflix, which offers a choice of tiers to pick from at a starting price of $8.99 a month (and that's for a non-HD stream).
There's a bumper pack option as well: $12.99 a month, which also gives you access to Hulu and ESPN Plus as well, two other streaming services that Disney already owns. As we've said, Disney owns a lot of stuff these days. Based on reports, more than a million people have already signed up for the service. You can check out this excellent value bundle deal above.
When it comes to Disney Plus pricing, always bear in mind that there might be special offers available for you to take advantage of: in the US, for example, Verizon is offering a free year of Disney Plus to unlimited data and Fios customers.
Just recently, Google has started offering three free months of Disney+ when you buy a compatible Chromebook, so that's one way of extending your free trial if you're thinking of dipping your toes into the Disney waters. You can view Disney Plus on the web on a Chromebook, or run the Android app on Chrome OS instead.
Disney has also starting selling Disney Plus gift cards at its stores in the US, so you can buy someone special a 12-month subscription (just make sure they invite you round to watch).
Wider European availability (including the UK) has now been confirmed for March 31, 2020 (Film Stories got it right), but as yet the prices haven't been set. Expect the same 'a little lower than Netflix' approach to apply wherever Disney Plus launches though. The delay is largely due to licensing issues and pre-existing deals with Sky.
A straight currency conversion suggests £5.40 a month for the basic package and £10 for the one with extras, but currency rates fluctuate all the time, and Disney isn't likely to pay much attention to them anyway.
Expect Disney to come in around those price points, though it can't offer ESPN Plus or Hulu here in the UK, because it doesn't have the necessary licensing rights. Somewhere in the £5-7 price range could be where Disney ends up pricing Disney Plus in the UK.
In the meantime, this staggered international roll out might leave Disney with something of a privacy problem on its hands. Disney has already got into hot water on social media by revealing spoilers about The Mandalorian, for example, before most of the world has had chance to see it, while hacked Disney+ logins have been put up for sale on the web.
Disney has certainly amassed a lot of video content down the years, and that means Disney Plus has a very strong selection of movies and TV shows on offer right out of the gate. Classic Disney productions are bolstered by franchises the company now owns, including the Marvel films and The Simpsons.
Indeed, you might have noticed some of this content disappearing from other platforms so that it can be exclusive to Disney's new streaming service. The selection is going to vary a little between regions, at least for the time being while these licences get sorted out: we know that Disney+ in Australia has more movies overall than the service in the US, for example.
Expect the content to grow fairly rapidly over time too. We just recently got a preview of a new 'Pixar in real life' series of shorts, in which various Pixar characters – from Monsters Inc, Inside Out, The Incredibles and more – appear in the real world. It looks fun and you can see the trailer above.
Disney also recently announced a new Original Movie called Togo, starring Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson, based on a true story. It looks like classic Disney fare, and it's streaming on Disney+ from the 20th of December, just in time for Christmas – check out the trailer below.
During the Disney+ trial that ran ahead of the wider launch in The Netherlands, a whopping total of 621 shows were available to watchers, and by now that number is definitely higher. As the trailers that we've embedded above show, new stuff is getting announced every day, and so far nothing has been taken away.
Thanks to Disney's acquisition of Fox, The Simpsons is available to stream exclusively on Disney Plus in the US – all 30 seasons of it. Most of the Star Wars films have been available from day one too (and expect more to get added after their cinema release). It's going to take you a long time to get through it all.
As for original content, we've got five Marvel shows on the way to the streaming platform (covering characters including Hawkeye and Loki), plus the first live action Star Wars series, called The Mandalorian (spot the Boba Fett link), which is available to watch now. The animated series The Clone Wars is switching to Disney Plus too, and there's an Obi-Wan TV show in the works as well.
One of the more recent announcements has centred around documentaries: Howard (about playwright and lyricist Howard Ashman), Untitled Mickey Mouse Documentary, and Science Fair are among the documentaries that are making their debuts on Disney Plus.
We also know that Avatar is making its streaming debut on Disney Plus, as per a couple of tweets from the official account – it's available to watch now. If you want to dive back into the world of Pandora and the Na'vi people, then the Disney Plus streaming service is the place to do it.
Disney has also confirmed that you're going to need an active Disney Plus subscription to keep watching shows and movies – if you decide you no longer want to keep paying, then you'll get locked out. That's pretty much par for the course for any streaming service like this.
As far as the scheduling is concerned, many big-name titles – including The Mandalorian and Captain Marvel – are already live. Other material will be later: the Loki series isn't due until 2021, for instance. We'll have to wait and see how long it takes for everything to become available.
How all of this translates into the UK isn't immediately clear, because Disney has different deals with UK broadcasters over shows like The Simpsons and its movies. It's a safe bet that all the original Disney Plus content (like The Mandalorian) will be available to stream at launch, but other material might take a while to move over.
Disney has now posted a three-hour (!) trailer showing everything that was available on Disney Plus as of the November 12 launch day – from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Country Bears to Lost Treasures of Maya. Get settled down and check it all out:
Something that Disney will very much be keeping an eye on are awards: official nods from the awards shows have been helpful in getting Netflix and Prime Video on the map, and even Apple TV Plus has been recognised by the Critics' Choice Awards now, nabbing a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Billy Crudup in The Morning Show.
Disney movies have earned gongs in the past of course, with the Marvel movie Black Panther picking up three Oscars earlier this year, but Disney will want to see that extended to its television shows as well – recognition for the original content it's putting out would certainly raise its reputation.
Disney has some huge franchises to call on for its Disney Plus service, and there's none bigger than Star Wars – the western-in-space property that Disney paid Lucasfilm $4 billion for back in 2012. Since then, we've seen plenty of new movies and new shows from Disney set in the Star Wars universe.
Brand new, live action Star Wars series The Mandalorian has been attracting the most buzz as far as new Disney+ shows go, and you can check out a trailer below. At the moment, you're also be able to watch the first six main films and The Force Awakens (though not The Last Jedi, yet), with the original triology available in 4K HDR quality for the first time.
On top of that you've got documentaries and animated series, including five seasons of The Clone Wars. A series based on Obi-Wan Kenobi is in development too, but we're not expecting to see that for a while – it wasn't available at the launch of the Disney Plus service and no fixed date for a debut has been set so far.
You can expect The Last Jedi and the The Rise Of Skywalker movies to make their way to the Disney Plus platform eventually, too, even if Disney executives are now sounding warnings about making too many Star Wars movies. Disney is proud of its Star Wars library, and that should show in the Star Wars section of Disney Plus.
That now extends as far as kids game shows, apparently: Disney has announced the Jedi Temple Challenge, to be hosted by none other than Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best, which will test youngsters across a range of skills in a variety of locations. It's due to arrive sometime in 2020.
If you're not a Star Wars fan, then what about the Marvel universe? Disney+ is the perfect streaming platform for Marvel superhero content new and old: several original series are on the way, including ones focusing on Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, and Loki, as well as a variety of documentaries and other features.
None of those series are available at launch though, unlike The Mandalorian Star Wars spin off – you're going to have to wait until 2020 or even 2021 before those Marvel originals start streaming, with exact release dates to be announced nearer the time. Let's hope Disney gets them right.
Then there are the movies: Ant-Man, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World are all available at launch or soon after. In fact 16 of the 23 MCU movies are now available.
Four more have launch dates – Thor: Ragnarok arrives on Disney Plus on 5 December, Black Panther turns up on 4 March 2020, Avengers: Infinity War hits on 25 June 2020, and Ant-Man and the Wasp lands on 29 July 2020.
As the tweet above announced, Avengers: Endgame was available straight away from the launch day of November 12 too – showing that Disney Plus had plenty of great Marvel movies on offer right from the beginning.
And what about the future of the MCU? In an interview with Bloomberg, Marvel chief creative officer Kevin Feige has confirmed that anyone who wants to "understand everything" in future Marvel movies is going to have to pick up a Disney Plus subscription.
In other words, the original Disney Plus content – including those series featuring Hawkeye, Loki and others – is going to feature information that'll help you understand what happens next in the next phase of the movies.
To work out when new content is going to drop, the best place to keep tabs on is probably Twitter – see below for details.
And then there's The Simpsons: the classic comedy is into its 31st season now, having completed more than 650 episodes, and they're (almost) all on Disney Plus, thanks to the Disney acquisition of 21st Century Fox. As far as we know, future episodes will be available to stream too, in the near future.
Simpsons episodes are exclusive to the platform, like a lot of Disney Plus content: you won't be able to stream The Simpsons anywhere else. The Simpsons World digital service, which previously hosted all the episodes online, has been closed down with the arrival of Disney Plus.
If you're a passionate fan of the adventures of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and the rest of the crew, then you've got one more reason to sign up for Disney Plus. Watching all the episodes of The Simpsons back-to-back sounds like the ultimate binge-watch.
All those lovely Simpsons episodes are available to stream at launch, in the US at least (though it does appear that the Michael Jackson episode has been pulled for obvious reasons). As yet though, Futurama – another Matt Groening creation – hasn't been confirmed for Disney Plus.
Disney Plus can be streamed on up to four devices at the same time in lovely 4K HDR for no extra cost – shots fired at Netflix, then, which charges a premium for 4K streaming. On top of that, Disney Plus comes with support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, meaning that if you have the hardware you'll be able to enjoy an incredibly immersive, cinema-grade audio-visual experience.
Disney has a lot of older content of course, so not everything is available in 4K UHD, which matches Netflix – in the case of the streaming rival to Disney+, some select movies and shows, as well as all the Netflix Originals, are available in 4K.
Some of the content you can already watch in 4K includes the Frozen movie, the original Lion King, and all the Marvel movies, so that's a good selection to get you going. Hopefully older content is going to get upgraded in the future too.
Netflix is probably the best guide for what to expect with Disney Plus. Disney Plus is available on Android devices, Apple devices, Chromecast, PS4, Xbox One, Roku, in your web browser and on the Nintendo Switch (though that last one is still coming soon).
It is worth double-checking compatibility before you sign up though – according to one developer, Linux computers, Chromebooks, and even certain Android devices don't meet the strict DRM (Digital Rights Management) requirements of Disney Plus.
When it comes to TVs, check with your manufacturer: Samsung smart TVs running the Tizen OS (basically anything from 2016 and later) have a dedicated Disney+ app, so you can get up and running straight away. For other TVs without that functionality, you could always use a Chromecast or a similar device.
The latest series of devices that have been confirmed to get Disney Plus access are those launched under the Amazon Fire TV banner: if you use Amazon kit to do your streaming, then you're able to tune into Disney Plus, and control everything with Alexa too.
The Disney Plus interface was shown off in advance, with the familiar rows of shows and movies arranged in blocks for viewers to scroll through. Content is sorted into major hubs, including Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. Now the service is live, you can log in and check for yourself.
Keep your eyes peeled for Disney+ functionality arriving on new TVs and other devices, because several bits of hardware have gained an official app since the service first launched.
Disney Plus also offers support for multiple users on the same accounts, like kids and parents – that's actually something that Netflix does very well – and parental control features come built-in. You're able to limit what the kids are able to watch, if you've got some at home.
Also confirmed is the ability to download content from Disney Plus to devices like smartphones and tablets. That should come in handy if you're travelling away from home and want to take the Marvel Cinematic Universe with you.
These apps are still a work in progress though – quite remarkably, at launch the Disney+ service didn't offer a way to automatically resume movies and shows you were part way through, which made it hard to keep track of where you were if you had to break off. That functionality has now been added, as has a "continue watching" bar on the front screen.
If you are in the UK and absolutely have to have Disney Plus before it arrives at the end of March 2020, then it may be worth investing in one of the very best VPNs on the market today, though even then it's going to be tricky (and there's no guarantee that everything will work smoothly).

    <h5 class="mb-1">The best Zwift setup for every budget</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’ve never heard of Zwift, it’s time to sit up and take note. The indoor training app has changed the way cyclists ride, with an ever-expanding virtual world that’s closer to a computer game than it is a conventional sport.
One thing remains certain, though: Zwift is a great way to keep fit, providing the motivation, engagement and results you need to keep coming back, whether riding solo on the app’s virtual roads, joining a group ride or embarking on a training plan. 
“Anyone can benefit from Zwift,” says Pav Bryan of Spokes Personal Performance Coaching. “Even if you don’t race, you can join a social group ride and become totally immersed in a new and expanding world.”
Here’s how you can use Zwift to improve your fitness and what you need to get started, regardless of your budget.
Zwift is an indoor training app that links your turbo trainer or indoor training bike to your computer, smartphone or tablet. Pedaling your bike powers a customisable avatar around one of the app’s five virtual worlds, each with its own network of roads.
Like riding outside, you can simply pedal at your own pace while there’s also the option to join group rides or complete structured training sessions. The harder you ride, the faster you go, with the app using an algorithm to convert your power output and weight into speed. There are also a number of Zwift training plans and Zwift workouts that you can use to help you meet your fitness goals.
If you’ve got your bike hooked up to one of the latest smart turbo trainers, or you’re using a smart-enabled indoor training bike, the app will automatically control the resistance to lock onto your target power during a training session, ensuring you get the most from every pedal stroke.
Smart trainers and smart indoor training bikes are also capable of automatically adjusting the resistance as the gradient changes on Zwift’s virtual roads, becomes harder as things get steeper, and easier when riding downhill. You also get a little breather when drafting another rider, just like when you’re riding on the road. Clever, eh?
First things first, you need a subscription to Zwift, which costs £12.99/$14.99 a month (Zwift also offers a seven-day free trial).
Most people will use Zwift with a turbo trainer, which converts your regular bike into an indoor training bike via the rear wheel. If you’re using a conventional turbo trainer, you’ll also need a ANT+ or Bluetooth speed sensor in order for Zwift to estimate your power output.
In recent years we’ve also seen the emergence of smart trainers, with internal electronics that directly measure your power output and transmit that data to Zwift (and other compatible training apps). Smart trainers offer the most realistic and engaging Zwift experience, but inevitably are more expensive.
If you're going the turbo trainer route, you don't need to specifically look for a 'Zwift turbo trainer', just ensure the one you have meets the criteria above.
So... what is the best Zwift setup? We've listed three options below, to cover a range of budgets.
The Elite Qubo Power Fluid is a conventional turbo, so it’s not capable of directly measuring power or automatically controlling the resistance, but it does offer excellent ride-feel for a budget trainer, helping to keep things smooth as you turn the pedals.
In order to use Zwift, you’ll also need to partner the Qubo Power Fluid with a speed sensor attached to your bike, which in turn needs to be paired to your smart device via ANT+ or Bluetooth (this will enable the app to estimate your power).
Step up a level with the Tacx Flux Smart, a mid-range, direct-drive smart trainer that offers built-in power measurement to a claimed accuracy of +/- three per cent and full connectivity.
That, of course, means the Flux Smart can directly link up with third-party apps, with the trainer capable of handling a thigh-crushing 1,500 watts, while also being able to replicate a gradient of up to ten per cent, so you’re ready to take on the toughest courses Zwift has to offer.
We’ve long been fans of the flagship Tacx Neo and, while the Tacx Flux Smart doesn’t quite have the all-singing features of its big brother, this is a serious impressive trainer for the money if you want to get the true Zwift experience without breaking the bank.
Wattbike has a long history of producing top-level training bikes and the Wattbike Atom is the company’s most advanced bike to date. 
The Atom offers full ANT+ and Bluetooth connectivity, so it can seamlessly connect to Zwift and a host of other software, including Wattbike’s own Hub app, which offers a comprehensive range of performance tests, training plans and analytical tools.
The Atom is a dedicated indoor training bike so you can jump straight on – there’s no faffing about with attaching your regular bicycle. It’s fully adjustable, so multiple members of the same household can use it, and the drop handlebar is equipped with electronic shifters, with 22 gears to adjust the resistance.
Of course, as a smart bike, you can also set the Atom to automatically adjust the resistance as you ride, whether completing a lung-busting interval session or simply cruising the roads of Zwift.
The advent of indoor training applications such as Zwift has proven to add another dimension to what was previously considered a mind-numbing but necessary chore. As the game has developed so have the variety of workouts available to users, all of which have been tailored by coaches for the best results.
In this pixel-based environment riders can participate in a raft of various in-game workouts which are a great way of adding structure to your training as well as boosting your fitness and strength.
Easy or challenging, each workout is based on your FTP (functional threshold power)  – the best average power output you can sustain for one hour. Geared to your particular ability, these sessions are aimed at building on your strengths and targeting your weakness areas in the form of high-intensity workouts.
1. The FTP test
In order to get the most out of any of the Zwift workouts you’ll need to know your FTP score. A quick way to get this sorted is by performing a FTP or ramp test. Not only will it provide you with a good baseline figure from which to kick off the season, as your fitness level increases so will your FTP. Zwift currently offers three FTP workouts, namely the ‘FTP Test’, ‘FTP Test (shorter)’ and the ‘Ramp Test’. 
How it works:
Regardless of which workout you choose, determining your FTP will require a short but intense all-out effort. While there’s no easy way of determining this figure – suffering is par for the course – the Ramp Test is probably the least invasive method of the three tests, requiring around 4-8 minutes of hard effort. After a five minute warmup, you will perform a series of 1-minute intervals, which begin at 100 watts and increase by 20 watts each minute until you can’t turn the pedals any longer. Once you stop pedalling, your FTP will be calculated based on your effort.
2. Jon’s short mix
So you’ve got a tight schedule? No problem. Jon’s Short Mix is one of 10, 'Less than an hour to burn' high-tensity sessions designed by Zwift to maximise your time. While by no means enjoyable, this workout focuses on a series of sub-threshold and maximal bursts which aim to improve your anaerobic capacity.
How it works:
It starts with a brief warmup and goes straight into two short anaerobic bursts, quickly followed by three max-effort sprints. There’s something for everybody in this quick mix of pain and pleasure, including a sweet spot training (SST) block to stimulate the FTP zone and a couple of efforts for the sprinters.
3. Mat Hayman Paris-Roubaix 1
Zwift has become so effective as a training tool that many professional riders have flocked to it as a means to keep fit during the winter months as well as recover from injury. Take Mathew Hayman, for example, who used Zwift to win Paris-Roubaix in 2016 after breaking his arm six weeks before the race. The Paris-Roubaix 1 workout gives Zwifters a little taste of what was required from Mat Hayman to win the cobbled Classic.
How it works:
The Mat Hayman Paris-Roubaix 1 workout is one of the most brutal sets currently available on Zwift. In fact, if you don’t feel nauseated after the first 10 minutes you’re doing it wrong. It doesn’t look all that intimidating at first but after the five minute warmup you’re thrown straight into a 20-second maximal sprint followed by one minute recovery at 65% FTP – repeat three times. A 20 minute SST interval follows, after which point you can either carry on (if you're strong enough) or throw in the towel. And it gets harder… 12 more maximal sprints separated by one-minute SST efforts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ethereum Istanbul Upgrade Goes Live: Here’s Why its Important</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TwitterFacebookWhatsAppGoogle+BufferLinkedIn
On Saturday, Ethereum developers rolled out the latest iteration of the software, “Istanbul.”
This blockchain upgrade, which has been in the works for months, brings a number of improvements to the network and brings the chain one large step closer to the implementation of Serenity, which will change Ethereum’s consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, thereby improving transaction costs, transaction speeds, network energy usage, and much more.
Here’s more about what Istanbul is about and how the upgrade may immediately help Ethereum.
So what is Istanbul?
Well, it’s a hard fork that implements six Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which were chosen from a pool of more than 30 candidates.
Here’s a list listing the EIPs and a brief summary of what they do, according to Ethereum Cat Herders.
According to Ethernodes, 96% of all Ethereum clients are running Istanbul at the moment, while some stragglers have been slow to update their full nodes. While the 4% currently pose some risks, a majority of mining pools, infrastructures, and exchanges dealing with Ethereum have confirmed that they’ve upgraded to Istanbul.
Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Sparkpool, and Ethermine, to name a few companies, have upgraded.
This may sound like a bunch of technical mumbo-jumbo for many of our readers, but the chief executive of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, recently laid out the importance of the upgrade in the tweet seen below, in which he wrote:
Indeed, as aforementioned, the Istanbul upgrade allows for zero-knowledge technologies to be better implemented on Ethereum. The technology Allaire referred to when he posted the above tweet is Matter Labs’ ZK Sync, which is slated to be a “trustless scaling and privacy solution for Ethereum based on ZK Rollup, with an emphasis on superb user and developer experiences.”
ZK Sync, should it launch successfully, is slated to be a system that will allow for Ethereum to see a “VISA-scale [level of] throughput of thousands of transactions per second while keeping the funds as secure as in the underlying L1 accounts and maintaining a high degree of censorship-resistance.”
With the capability of transacting thousands of near-instant and cheap transactions per second (that are private no less), Ethereum developers could begin to build applications that are similar to if not better than their real-world counterparts, creating a possible wave of adoption.
Istanbul also implements other improvements, which were mentioned earlier, though this seems like a near-ish benefit that could dramatically improve the lives of Ethereum users, and may do well to improve the adoption of the network and its applications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crypto Is Money: Dai Stablecoin Support Arrives on Coinbase Debit Card</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TwitterFacebookWhatsAppGoogle+BufferLinkedIn
If you can spend cryptocurrency in mainstream society, then crypto is money — at least so says the tech’s biggest proponents.
Following that line of thought, the Dai — the Ethereum community’s darling stablecoin — definitely just took another decisive step toward “currency” status, insofar as U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase revealed on December 6th it had added Dai support to its “Coinbase Card” debit card offering.
Accordingly Dai joins the card, which was launched back in the spring and is currently only available in the United Kingdom and the European Union, as its 10th addition, with the assets it already supports including (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP, Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), 0x (ZRX), and Stellar lumens (XLM).
As such, Coinbase’s European users can now spend their Dai holdings for everyday purchases, which for many Dai proponents is the point of using the stablecoin in the first place — to spend your stable Dai while holding your volatile ETH, as it were, since each Dai is worth approximately $1 USD. On the flip side, ether — which is more akin to a commodity — has considerably more investment upside and considerably more risk.
The development is another step toward mainstream adoption for the stablecoin, whose builders undertook a rebranding last month in order to make the “dollar coin’s” aesthetics more in line with other major world currencies.
Wyre, known by some as the “Stripe” of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, explained more this week on their platform’s coming “meta transactions” capability, which the company said will arrive in 2020 and will allow users to interact wither Ethereum decentralized finance applications directly from their debit cards.
Specifically, Wyre said meta transactions would “effectively turn … Apple Pay or Google Pay wallets into secure Ethereum wallets to fund [DeFi] transactions.”
That’s a big deal, because one pain point for new users to cryptocurrency has been the knowledge gap, e.g. not knowing where to begin. With fiat DeFi on-ramps, Wyre will make Ethereum’s dApps more readily accessible to everyday users, which should drive adoption in turn.
Last month, the Maker community — stewards of the Dai stablecoin — undertook their biggest evolutionary action to date in voting, and thereafter activating, Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD).
Prior to MCD, Maker dApp users could only draw out automated Dai loans using ether as collateral. In the wake of MCD, more cryptocurrencies beyond ETH can now be used as collateral for Maker loans. The first additional crypto to be voted in by MKR token holders was Basic Attention Token.
With that said, MCD is set to supersede the previously reigning “Single-Collateral Dai,” which is now known as Sai. Assuming liquidity is available, Sai holders can migrate their tokens to Dai at any time using a special migration smart contract deployed by Maker’s builders.
At press time, there 45.5 million Dai and 58.5 million Sai in circulation, meaning the new MCD version of the stablecoin has come close to “flippening” its predecessor in number.
Maybe, maybe not. But it’s clear the decentralized stablecoin has structural and timing advantages over America’s actual dollar minters at the U.S. Treasury.
Why? Firstly, because the Dai is already here and useful for people around the world while top U.S. officials have no plans for releasing a digital dollar any time soon. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin just told American legislators that the government isn’t putting USD on the blockchain for the foreseeable future.
Secondly, the Dai is permissionless to a degree that the U.S. government likely doesn’t agree with. Yet it is growing increasingly popular for that very reason.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's Ad-Targeting Crackdown Shakes Up Ad Market</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two years ago, Apple launched an aggressive battle against ads that track users across the web. Today executives in the online publishing and advertising industries say that effort has been stunningly effective -- posing a problem for advertisers looking to reach affluent consumers. The Information reports: Since Apple introduced what it calls its Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature in September 2017, and with subsequent updates last year, advertisers have largely lost the ability to target people on Safari based on their browsing habits with cookies, the most commonly used technology for tracking. One result: The cost of reaching Safari users has fallen over 60% in the past two years, according to data from ad tech firm Rubicon Project. Meanwhile ad prices on Google's Chrome browser have risen slightly. That reflects the fact that advertisers pay more money for ads that can be targeted at people with specific demographics and interests. "The allure of a Safari user in an auction has plummeted," said Rubicon Project CEO Michael Barrett. "There's no easy ability to ID a user." This shift is significant because iPhone owners tend to be more affluent and therefore more attractive to advertisers. Moreover, Safari makes up 53% of the mobile browser market in the U.S., according to web analytics service Statscounter. Only about 9% of Safari users on an iPhone allow outside companies to track where they go on the web, according to Nativo, which sells software for online ad selling. It's a similar story on desktop, although Safari has only about 13% of the desktop browser market. In comparison, 79% of people who use Google's Chrome browser allow advertisers to track their browsing habits on mobile devices through cookies. (Nativo doesn't have historical data so couldn't say what these percentages were in the past.)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reaper 6 is out now. The latest version of the Cockos-developed DAW introduces new upgrades to a package already renowned for its extensive and customisable feature set. MIDI CC envelopes can now send curved messages to your hardware or software devices, meaning you get smooth, continuous parameter changes instead of discrete events. A new time-stretching algorithm, a graphic patchbay for advanced routing, embedded plug-in displays and improved performance in large projects are among the other improvements. Find out more details on the Reaper website. Reaper 6 is only $60, which is considerably cheaper than more popular DAWs. The cost includes free updates until version 7.99. A full-featured 60 day demo is also available. Learn how Joe uses Reaper in our Art Of Production feature.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tata Altroz Review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tata Motors is being bitten by the very bugs that were its allies in the past. Overwhelmed by the hype, and feeling underwhelmed by the cars themselves of a decade ago, customers continue to be wary of buying Tata’s models of today. The stables have been cleaned out and the vehicles on sale now are a bunch of healthy, relatively reliable, well-designed products that have been awarded high ratings for safety by global agencies. Yet, the market’s response has been lukewarm.
Tata models of the past five years, including the Tiago/ Tigor, the Hexa, Nexon and the Harrier have been pointers to the level of maturity that the brand has reached as a car maker. All of them have featured great design, updated tech, and decent finish quality and build. There are still some areas where Tata cars need to catch up, but with each new model that gap is being bridged. The latest model to join the lineup will be the Altroz, which when launched next month will help Tata fill another yawning gap in its portfolio. I drove the Altroz last week and I think it represents the culmination of a decade of concerted efforts at improving the refinement and dynamics of their cars. It is time to give Tata a second chance.
Yes, there are rough edges in the Altroz, but very few of them and mostly in the ergonomics side. In general, there is a sense of everything having come together nicely in the Altroz, starting with the design. The B+ segment (premium hatch) has seen very few recent additions and the Altroz promises to inject some freshness into the category. The design of this new hatch stands out from the current crop, which should work in its favour. The cab forward design that has been a regular from Tata is still very much alive in the Altroz too. But, the design is a nice mix of elements that makes the hatch look like it also has the flavour of a high-set crossover.
The steeply sloped bonnet starts with the signature Humanity line which we have seen in all of the last five cars from the brand. The nose is extremely prominent thanks to the glossy black band that runs across the top of the bonnet grille and over the headlamps like a brow. To shake off that attention-grabbing feature, it gets chrome under-lipping that runs the width of the grille and wraps around the bottom edge of the headlamps. The chunky front fender with what looks like a large airdam, also houses the cornering fog lamps. The simple, elegantly designed bonnet slab merges into a slim A-pillar and a steeply raked roofline. The bulging wheel arches are big contributors to the crossover hints in the Altroz’s design. Following a family design language, the front window has a kink where the waistline dips right after the quarter glass and rises up to follow a straight line to the rear, helping reduce the blind spot. But the thick A-pillar does take away the advantage.
The rear of the Altroz features a three-dimensional, layered design. The tail-lamps are sort of bug-eyed protrusions from the body of the car and the fender is two chiseled layers. In the top trim variant that I was testing, there was a glossy black panel adorning the portion of the tailgate between and over the top of the two tail-lamps, to create a sort of matching theme to the front. The rear design makes the Altroz look wide and squat, while the rising belt-line continues to give it crossover traits. The ground clearance is 165mm, though from the pictures it’ll seem like the car is sprung higher. With the rear seats in place, the boot space is 345 litres. Viewed from the side, the windows are nicely framed by the thick, glossy black window graphic trim, somewhat like the Nexon’s white stripe.
The fit and finish and quality of materials on the outside is really good, with excellently painted panels and consistently tight shutlines. So, the expectations from the cabin are as already heightened as I step in. The competition is intense with cars like the Hyundai i20, in which the cabin feels as good or better than many sedans. So, the Altroz’s cabin has to match these benchmarks. Slipping behind the wheel, I discover that the interior features a pleasing mix of materials and features that are modern and match most, if not all, of the other cars in the segment in terms of quality. The layout of the dashboard is fairly conventional, though the design manages to highlight each of the elements in it. Matt grey panels at the top and glossy silver panels at the front give the dash contrasting elements. Hidden LED ambient lighting gives some more character to the cabin and highlight features like the floating panel at the top of the centre stack, which houses the 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system.
The seats, the firm cushioning and the fabric upholstery feel good to sit on. Legroom is adequate both at the front and the rear even for tall passengers, though I suspect that the Baleno and Jazz may have a bit more kneeroom. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find a dead pedal in the Altroz. Also, the choice of material for the textured dashboard plastic panels is good, though there is still considerable glare on the windscreen. Fit and finish of the switches, knobs and controls are also good. It was good to note that the Altroz’s cabin also gets all the latest gadgets and features like auto headlamps, auto wipers etc in the top trim variant that I was driving. Instrument cluster features a combination of an analog speedo, and a digital info and rpm-meter. Toggling the menu button on the steering gets you to switch between screens that display real-time mileage, average mileage, distance to empty and an interesting representation of the power and torque in use and available real-time. The sporty flat-bottomed, multi-function steering wheel also felt great to hold and use. A Harman music system, a dual-shelf glovebox and a umbrella holder in the front door panels are some of the other interesting features in the cabin.
The Altroz is being offered with the petrol and diesel engines that we have already seen in the Tigor and Nexon, but at different output levels. The 3-cylinder, 1,199cc Revotron petrol engine in the Altroz is BS6 compliant, and generates a peak power of 86PS and peak torque of 113Nm. The engine is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The diesel unit is the Revotorq, 4-cylinder, 1,497cc, turbocharged and intercooled engine. This engine is also BS6 compliant, and without the need for an ammonia tank. In the Altroz, the engine delivers a peak output of 90PS and a peak torque of 200Nm. A 5-speed manual gearbox is the choice here too. Both the engines are likely to get automatic transmissions soon and the choice may be DCTs (dual clutch); whether they’d be wearing a JTP badge is something we are going to have to wait to see.
The engines are both good choices for the Altroz and both fairly peppy units. The three-pot petrol is the surprise here, delivering a fairly sprightly performance once it gets on the go. The only bit that is a dampener is throttle response which feels a bit muted in the Eco driving cycle and is only a shade better in the City mode. A Sport mode would have been a welcome addition, though I think it is probably being saved for the DCT endowed variant. There is some amount of transmission noise that gets into the cabin and in the diesel variant I drove had a bit of vibration at the steering too. The manual gearbox shift quality is good, though with the tall stick, the throw is fairly long and really quick shifts are it’s forte. Noise levels inside the cabin have been contained. Powertrain noise inside the cabin is not intrusive, and though I could hear the engine even at mid-revs, unlike some of the other gruff 3-cylinders, this one sounds good. Brake setup features discs at the front and drums at the rear, and ABS with EBD is standard fitment across variants. Braking is progressive and the Altroz feels stable under hard emergency braking.
The ride quality is as good as competitors like the Maruti Suzuki Baleno and Honda Jazz, thanks to a fairly sorted suspension setup. The Altroz feels light and easy to turn at slow speeds and very planted at high speeds with the steering weighing up nicely too. There is no loss of composure or edgy feeling even when it is being pushed at its limits. However, it doesn’t feel as planted and its handling isn’t as confidence inspiring as the segment benchmark - the Volkswagen Polo. The Goodyear rubber that my test mules came shod with had high grip limits, so no squealing even when taking corners at high speed. Both the diesel and petrol versions sported 16-inch rims, but the petrol was shod with wider and slightly lower profile 195/55 tyres.
The Altroz has been built on a brand new modular platform called ALFA which is likely to spawn more models with different body styles over the next few years, including electrics. While the architecture’s overall strengths look promising based on the Altroz’s performance, it also delivers some structural benefits to the new premium hatch. These include the wide, 90-degree opening of all four doors and the flat (no transmission tunnel) floor at the rear of the Altroz.
There are minor ergonomics issues inside the cabin that can be overlooked. But, the overall refinement levels of the Altroz will still be a shade lower than the i20 and the Jazz. The Altroz will be offered with four trim variants and customers can customise their cars irrespective of which variant they have chosen.
The Altroz’s potential for consistent performance and long term reliability looks promising. But, I think to bridge the trust deficit Tata Motors should consider conquest pricing when its first premium hatch is launched next month.

While Kia Motor's ad for its Seltos triggering design creativity bagged some 232 million views, Samsung India's campaign for its Good Vibes struck a chord with netizens garnering over 205 million views.
Chinese handset maker Oppo's ad spot for its F11 pro model bagged over 96 million views, while a television commercial by Xiaomi India about Mi TV brand registered over 133 million views.
Given the huge number of electronic and mobile brands that have made it to the top rank, BusinessLine reached out to Satya Raghavan, Director - YouTube Partnerships, India, to know what the trend revealed about consumption patterns across the country.
"YouTube’s year-end ads leaderboard is a reflection and true representation of the year’s biggest campaigns," said Raghavan. “With the growing reach and highly engaged audience, YouTube today is a preferred launch platform for brands. This is reflected in the leaderboard with Kia motors and many of the new mobile phone brands,” he said.
Noting that while advertisers have always preferred YouTube for long form ads, Raghavan said brands are also tapping into YouTube Blast that offers "unparalleled reach with relevant audience in minimum time and eventually provides higher impact."
As for helping brands reach out to consumers in today's cluttered marketplace, Raghavan clarified, “Viewers don’t come to YouTube for distraction, they come to engage. According to an independent study commissioned by Ipsos, 85 per cent of our subscribers watch new videos from their favourite creators within two days. And, that engagement also applies to ads. More than 95 per cent of YouTube ads are viewable, the highest rate in the industry," he added.
Samsung India created a campaign for its Good Vibes app which helps deaf and blind people communicate with others. Made by advertising agency Cheil, the campaign tells the story of a young deaf and blind girl who uses the Good Vibes app to reach out to her family. The ad bagged the second spot on the leaderboard.
Another television commercial by Xiaomi India highlighted smart features of its Mi TV brand, specifically the voice command capability powered by Google Assistant. The brand leveraged the on screen chemistry of actors Sumeet Raghavan and Rupali Ganguly, aka comedy show series Sarabhai versus Sarabhai fame. This ad bagged the fourth spot on the leaderboard.
Chinese handset maker Oppo's ad spot for its F11 pro model was about key features and sleek design and bagged the fifth highest viewership.
At the seventh spot on the leaderboard is Aditya Birla Group's 'Big in your life' campaign which showcases the company’s journey of a brand that reached out to and empowers people at every stage in their life.
Given the massive depth and diversity of content on the platform, brands have leveraged YouTube to tell some of the year’s most compelling brand stories, the best of which form the YouTube ads leaderboard for 2019.
The list represents the top 10 ads on YouTube in India that resonated most with audiences and celebrates the brands that performed best through a combination of popularity and promotion.
Over the years, video have gone mainstream with YouTube-- now reaching 265 million monthly active users as per ComScore 2019 (April), making it a go-to destination for brands. They have innovatively capitalised on YouTube’s popularity by creating engaging ads, says the official.
Over the last two years, the company has launched several ad products – Bumpers, Director Mix, TrueView, Video Ads Sequencing and YouTube Blast, being the newest tool. "These products are designed to ensure that YouTube is the perfect platform for both brand and performance advertisers," said Raghavan.
Citing an example, he added, with formats such as TrueView for Action, advertisers can create ads with interactive functionality. "This has been a huge success for performance advertisers looking to optimise video for a specific user action, like signing up for a service or buying a product," he added.
Speaking about leads and referrals, Raghavan added though YouTube is driving brand awareness and consideration, with TrueView for Action the firm can now offer a full funnel solution to drive results both online and offline.
"You can use video ads to drive any action on your website that’s important to your business, for example, leads or referrals. While driving online action is important, offline action is also crucial for driving business results and marketers across the board are tapping into this to drive business results," said Raghavan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi takes on Apple in Japan with Mi Note 10 featuring 108-megapixel camera</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi Corp, the world’s fourth-largest smartphone maker, is entering Japan and taking on Apple Inc with a budget-friendly smartphone and a connected fitness tracker.
The company is making the Mi Note 10 Android smartphone available in Japan for immediate pre-order to be shipped on December 16, according to a statement on Monday. Priced from 52,800 yen ($486), the handset has a high-resolution 108-megapixel camera, a 5,260mAh battery rated to last longer than two days and a 6.5-inch OLED display with curved edges.
Alongside the Mi Note, Xiaomi also introduced its Mi Smart Band 4 wearable for 3,490 yen, a portable battery pack for 1,899 yen, an induction-heating rice cooker for 9,999 yen and a premium all-metal suitcase for 17,900 yen, all aggressively priced for the Japanese market.
The top Chinese smartphone vendor after Huawei Technologies Co. is looking eastward to help offset declining share in its home market. Xiaomi’s China shipments took a 30 per cent dive last quarter, while hardware sales in India and Europe grew. It faces an uphill battle in Japan, however, where the smartphone market has been shrinking, is dominated by Apple and features unique consumer preferences that have kept domestic brands like Sharp Corp and Fujitsu Ltd relevant.
“Xiaomi has to keep looking for new markets to recover its smartphone shipment growth, after losing its market share in China. Outside the home-grown brands, Japanese have a strong preference for the iPhone,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai said.
Apple shipped about 45 per cent of all the smartphones in Japan in the fiscal first half to September 30, according to a report by MM Research Institute Ltd, Sharp, Samsung Electronics Co and Sony Corp followed, none of which exceeded 13 per cent. Huawei, which ranked fifth last fiscal year, didnt make the top 5 after carriers earlier this year dropped its models from their line ups amid United States (US)-China trade tensions.
Over the long run, Xiaomi is betting the worldwide commercialization of fifth-generation wireless technology will juice demand for mobile devices capable of hosting ultra-fast video and game streaming. The company plans to introduce at least 10 5G-enabled smartphone models next year as state-backed carriers in China spend billions of dollars constructing networks. Japan’s smartphone shipments will probably shrink about 10 per cent to 27.6 million units for the full year ending March, before rebounding the following year when 5G models will contribute about 2 million units to the total, according to MM Research.
Xiaomi is also expanding its product portfolio beyond smartphones to encompass everything from electric scooters to smart door locks, part of an effort to build an Internet of Things ecosystem. Its continuing to build out internet services in pursuit of a strategy billionaire co-founder Lei Jun articulated before the companys’ 2018 Hong Kong initial public offering. The stock is trading at less than half the price of its peak in July 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sony has confirmed that Minecraft Bedrock edition will be released tomorrow on PS4, with this version of the game unifying the code across all versions of the game. This means that PS4 players will be able to play with those on Xbox One, Switch, mobile, and PC. Of course, Minecraft is already on PS4 and millions of people will own it already. Good news, current owners. Update 1.14 will add all the content that the Bedrock edition will have so no need to double-dip.
The content, aside from cross-play, will include the Minecraft Marketplace where PS4 players will be able to get skins, mini-games, and packs. Back in October, we got the first hint for the Bedrock edition when update 1.13.0 went live which had the line “Added PlayStation-related assets and translation strings into the game files.”
So,cross-play and marketplace. PS4 players are now getting the experience everyone else had access to.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taking flight as Microsoft Flight Simulator returns to the skies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once a mainstay of Microsoft’s gaming business, it’s now been 13 years since the last Microsoft Flight Simulator. Now with Asobo Studio at the helm, Microsoft are looking to right that wrong, doing so with a brand new and enticing approach.
Compared to a game released before the dawn of smartphones, when Google Earth still sprung to mind before Google Maps did, Flight Simulator has an awful lot of new technology to lean on. For one thing, the whole world is streaming into your game in real time, letting you fly way off without a care for map limits thanks to the Petabytes of data captured by Microsoft for Bing. Some of that has been done with pure satellite imagery, elsewhere it’s been combined with images captured from planes flying over a city or town, and all of that has then been crunched down by the Azure AI to create the 3D world, spotting the roads for cars to drive down, where trees exist so that they can be affected by the weather, where streams run so that water can flow.
If you’re expecting photorealism, it’s not quite there. Because of how the 3D world has been captured and then generated, it feels more like the 3D map views that you have in Apple Maps in terms of geometry. There’s road traffic down there, but it’s following generated paths that can sometimes see cars and trucks Skyrim their way up hills. A fair bit of this is also dependent on that hook to the Azure cloud – wait, didn’t Microsoft bang on about the cloud and gaming at one point? – but you will be able to play offline, losing things like photogrammetric data and so diminishing some of the graphical effects.
That doesn’t take away from how impressive it is though, especially when factoring in the changing time of day and weather effects. It’s this that really makes the game look spectacular, and cities go from basking in the sun to lighting up to continue hustling and bustling in the moonlight. But forget what’s thousands of feet below you (unless you really want to try and fly sideways through some skyscrapers – which you obviously do), you’ll spend most of your time way up amongst the gorgeous clouds. The weather can be set however you see fit – if you want to fly at dusk in Rome, you can, or you might want to try to land in the fog at Heathrow – but you can also flip to the real world conditions at any time that you’re flying. Sure, you can set the weather how you see fit, but there’s something weirdly magical about being able to visit real time weather around the world.
It’s wonderful to just be able to fly around and chill out as you explore different corners of the world, but that would be to ignore the “Simulator” side of the title. I went hands on with a ludicrously fully-featured flight controller. Forget just grabbing a joystick and plugging that in, here I was playing with a realistic feeling yoke from Honeycomb, Saitek throttle control and Thrustmaster’s rudder pedals. Needless to say I didn’t have a clue how to use all of this, but was given some help with the throttle and guidance from one of Asobo’s developers.
Starting off by flying over Naples, I simply floated through the world and got a feel for the gentler side of the game, flicking between camera views and soaking in the environment, but there’s also a range of challenges to be featured in the game. A landing challenge at Courcheval Altiport, a tiny little runway up in the French Alps, is a real test for the game’s simulation.
This is one of the most challenging airports to land at in the world with an upward-sloping runway amidst the mountains, forcing you to take a curved approach, manage the throttle and plant your plane without even lighting aids to help in inclement weather that alone would surely see many flights abandoned. The game gives you a tutorial for the path you should take, with your landing then scored by how well you followed the path, how accurately you hit the touch down zone, speed, and so on. I managed to get the plane down, but needless to say that my score was not going to trouble any leaderboards.
Of course, with the game coming to Xbox One as well as PC, it’s going to be fascinating to see how it stacks up on much more humble gaming hardware. There’s certainly going to be enough simulation settings to fiddle with for if you’re just playing with a controller or a relatively basic flight stick, but how it holds up graphically when so much of the game is streamed in from Microsoft’s servers will also be interesting to see. Can it compete with a top-tier PC, as I was able to play on?
Needless to say, I came away from Flight Simulator very impressed. The series evolved a great deal from its humble beginnings in the 80s through to Flight Simulator X in 2006, and that style of flight sim continued with games like X-Plane and Aerofly, but Flight Simulator is something else entirely with its worldwide scope. This is absolutely one to keep an eye on in 2020.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new patch has been released for RuneScape by Jagex that is focused on improving farming and the game’s herblore as well as a number of other changes and fixes. These changes apply both to the PC version of RuneScape as well as mobile. On mobile specifically, Clan Citadel minigames have been improved with the interface made easier to use, and the interface should no longer lock when using spells from the spellbook.
The full list of changes can be found below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Survivor SA' renewed for season 8 - entries now open!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town – If you think you can outwit, outlast and outplay now is your chance to put yourself to the test.
On Sunday M-Net announced that Survivor SA has been renewed for an eighth season.
Entries have officially opened, and those who think they have the skills to become the sole survivor on a desolate exotic island have until Monday 20 January at midnight to enter.
To be eligible to enter, you have to be 18 years or older by 20 January 2020. You also have to be a South African citizen or have a permanent residence status and need to make sure that your passport is valid until August 2020.
To enter, you have to complete the online entry form here. Once you have logged on to, you will go through a quick and easy online audition process. First, you will be asked to fill in a short application form with a few personal questions, and thereafter you have to submit a three-minute video, showcasing your game plan and why the Survivor SA team should pick you. If your online application is successful, you will be contacted by the Survivor SA team for a call-back, and who knows, you could be part of the next season’s castaways.
Executive Producer Handrie Basson says: "If you love watching Survivor, if you have shouted at the TV in frustration and admiration and if you have said ‘I can do this!’ or if you have thought ‘I will never do that!’… then it’s time to get off the couch and onto the island!"
Nico Panagio will return as host of Survivor SA season eight which will air on M-Net (DStv 101) in the second half of 2020.

The Switch, Nintendo’s popular gaming console, allows you to play games at home and on the go. For a limited time, Best Buy is offering a $30 gift card when you buy the console.

Today only, Adidas Creators Club members can save 40% on a wide selection of sneakers and clothing by using the promo code “FRIENDS” at checkout. Non-members can save 30% with the same promo code, but it’s worth signing up here for the bigger discount – all it means is that you’ll be on Adidas email list. One of the best deals in the sale is the Men’s Ultraboost 19 for $75.60 (originally $180).
Whether you’re shopping for seasonal holiday decor or you’re completely furnishing a new space, Target is a great place to find deals on home goods. For Green Monday (another retail holiday that happens the week after Cyber Monday), you can save 30% on home goods, furniture, bedding, and decor. Prices are as marked, so you won’t need a promo code to save.
Keeping all of your electronic devices fully charged can be hard to do when you’re constantly on the go, but Anker has a great selection of products for fast and efficient charging. As an Amazon Deal of the Day, you can save up to 40% on charging accessories, including power banks, USB-C and Lightning charging cables, car chargers, and wireless charging pads.

With the ethos of a startup and the backing of a large corporation (Walmart), Bonobos is currently the most successful new menswear brands out there. Until tonight at 11:59 p.m. EST, the brand is having a huge sale with an extra 30% off final sale styles, likely to help them create room for incoming seasonal styles. Simply use the promo code “PRESENTTIME” at checkout. The sale includes button-up shirts, chinos, shorts, activewear, and much more.
The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is a great option if you’re new to earning points and miles, as it has a reasonable $95 annual fee. You’ll earn 2 points per dollar on all travel and dining purchases and 1 point on everything else, and the card includes some valuable benefits like trip delay coverage and primary car rental insurance.
You can earn 60,000 Chase points with the Chase Sapphire Preferred when you spend $4,000 in the first three months from account opening. That’s worth at least $750 toward travel. Read our review to learn more about the card’s benefits.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yes, you did just read that right. Plex doesn’t want a penny for the streaming service, which boasts a library of thousands of Hollywood blockbusters, television shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals and more.
Plex announced back in September that it had teamed up with Warner Bros to start to deliver ad-supported content by the end of the year. The service has now launched with its first wave of movies and TV shows, with the promise of more partnerships – and therefore, content – to come soon.

The ad-supported movie streaming service is available right now in more than 200 countries. All you need is a Plex account, which is also free to set-up.
There are no paid subscription tiers, so you won’t even be asked to cough up some cash to unlock Ultra HD, streaming on multiple devices, or any number of other capabilities that rival streaming services keep locked behind a paid subscription tier.
Plex’s library of free-to-watch includes content from the major Hollywood studios, including Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), Lionsgate, Legendary and Warner Bros. themselves.
You’ll find movies like American Ultra, Frequency, Lord of War, Rain Man, Raging Bull, The Terminator, Thelma & Louise and Apocalypse Now, with more movies being added all the time.
For those who don’t know, until now, Plex has been a media library service designed to help you keep your own video content organised and available to stream on any of your devices.
Using the desktop client, users can keep their TV shows and movies stored and searchable by directors, actors and more. Downloading the Plex app on your iPhone, Android, iPad, set-top box, or other hardware allows you to access the library of content and then stream from your own server.
Plex offers a paid-subscription service called Plex Pass that unlocks some additional features, including synchronisation with mobile devices, cloud storage, metadata fetching for music, support for multiple users, parental controls, and more.
This is nothing to do with the new movie streaming service, which is listed as Free to Watch under the Movies & TV tab within the Plex app.

WhatsApp has confirmed on its support page that anyone with a Windows Phone will lose access from December 31, 2019. And that’s not all.
The deadline for ageing Windows smartphone will be followed by blocks for iPhones running anything older than iOS 7 and Android devices with versions 2.3.7 installed. This iPhone and Android block will come into force from February 1, 2020.
If you love WhatsApp and have any of the phones mentioned – or haven’t updated your operating system in a few years, you’ll need to head to a shop to get an upgrade to something a little more recent.
JUST IN: WhatsApp update brings a new feature that users have been calling for
HERE’S ALL THE DATES WHEN WHATSAPP STOPPED WORKING ON SOME PHONES
• Nokia Symbian S60 after June 30, 2017• BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 after December 31, 2017• Nokia S40 after December 31, 2018• All Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019• Android versions 2.3.7 and older after February 1, 2020• iPhone iOS 7 and older after February 1, 2020
Justifying the decision to stop supporting older hardware, WhatsApp said in a blog post: “As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use.
“While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don’t offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app’s features in the future. This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.
“If you use one of these affected mobile devices, we recommend upgrading to a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone to continue using WhatsApp.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leading the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of changes for the 2020 iPhone. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Monday.
2020 iPhone: A new rumor claims that Apple may increase the battery size in next year’s iPhone, reports MacRumors. According to this rumor, the tech company will be able to do this due to a new battery protection part. This will be smaller in size than the older component, which in turn frees up more room for the battery. It’s unknown how much of a larger battery the 2020 iPhone may get thanks to this change.
Mac Pro Approval: Apple fans are getting closer and closer to the launch of the new Mac Pro, AppleInsider notes. New approval from the Federal Communications Commission has it clearing two versions of the computer for radio frequency emissions. That’s the normal tower Mac Pro and the new rack-mounted server version. While this doesn’t reveal when the devices will come out, it does confirm that AAPL is moving along with their production.
Golden Globes: Apple TV+ may have only come out this year but it’s already receiving Golden Globes nominations, reports 9to5Mac. The nominations are for the streaming service’s The Morning Show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon. The show has been nominated for best TV series drama and both of its stars are also up for best actress nominations.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MILWAUKEE - The Wisconsin Better Business Bureau is sharing tips on how to avoid popular scams and package thefts this holiday season.
Scammers are known to use tricks like phishing emails posing as delivery companies, fake "missed delivery" tags and blatant package theft to take advantage of consumers during the holiday season. In order to prevent these scams, the BBB recommends people take proper precautions.
A simple tip, especially when a package contains fragile or valuable items, it to get shipping insurance for any deliveries. In addition to insurance, tracking information can help make sure consumers stay in the know during the delivery process.
Being skeptical of calls or emails about missed deliveries is also helpful. Normally, delivery services will opt to leave a missed delivery slip on your door with instructions on how to proceed.
Though it often costs a bit extra, requiring a signature for package deliveries can help ensure the package isn't left on a doorstep or in a lobby, vulnerable to theft. If at all possible, try having packages delivered to a place of work or a trusted friend who will be available to accept the delivery.
Finally, the BBB recommends opening the package immediately after delivery to make sure there are no issues with the package. If there are, be sure to follow the seller's return policy for damaged or unwanted goods.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Should Investors Expect From Advanced Micro Devices Stock in 2020?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By all accounts, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) hit it out of the park in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices stock is currently up 115% over the last 12 months. 
And many analysts believe that AMD stock price can climb a lot more. AMD continues to hold its own against bigger companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). 
Moreover, AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, has stated that the company will release even more impactful  products in 2020. Let’s look at a few reasons why AMD stock price may rise a great deal more in 2020.
Here are three reasons to be optimistic about AMD stock’s 2020 outlook.
During the third quarter, AMD’s revenue took a hit, mostly due to lower  sales of its semi-custom chips which are used in gaming consoles.
The decline occurred because both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) are getting ready to release their next-generation gaming consoles. As a result, both companies are not building many of their current consoles now, and their demand for AMD’s chips used in those consoles has dropped. But the sales of AMD’s semi-custom chips should pick back up once the next-gen consoles are released. 
Another reason to be bullish about Advanced Micro Devices stock is the company’s CEO, Lisa Su. October marked Su’s fifth year as CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, and a lot has happened during that time. 
When she took over, AMD stock price was hovering around $2.66. Today the stock is near an all-time high. 
Su was able to bring the company back from bankruptcy, restructure it, and help it become profitable again. She did that by consistently delivering competitive products to the market quickly.
Investors are so excited about Advanced Micro Devices stock partly because the company continues to take market share from Intel. In the central processing unit (CPU) market, AMD  has an estimated market share of 18%, five percentage points above its level of a year ago.
Of course, Intel still has a big lead on AMD in the CPU market. But now that AMD’s CPU sales are steadily growing, it should be able to continue to raise its market share in 2020.
Advanced Micro Devices has faced plenty of challenges over the past couple of years. First, the company experienced the cryptocurrency bust, and then the semiconductor market slowed considerably due to the ongoing trade war. 
But the company’s revenue and earnings are still improving, and it continues to take market share from its competitors. All in all,  AMD clearly looks well-positioned to keep moving forward in 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kraken Adds GBP Support for U.K.; What This Means for Crypto Market</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Crypto asset exchange Kraken has added two new options for GBP deposits and withdrawals in attempts to speed up the exchange of funds for users.
In collaboration with UK-based payments services provider Clear Junction, Kraken users can now fund accounts using either the UK’s Faster Payments Service (FPS/BACS) or the CHAPS network, as reported on the exchange’s blog.
FPS is significantly cheaper than CHAPS, with fees of just 1.95 GBP; transfers sent via FPS typically arrive on the same day, although this is not guaranteed.
On the other hand, the CHAPS network, with fees of 21 GBP, is intended for larger payments that need a guaranteed arrival; payments issued over CHAPS are guaranteed to arrive on the same day if issued before the daily 14:00 UTC cutoff.
This latest announcement further promotes Kraken’s mission of  “delivering financial freedom by giving clients more choice when it comes to managing their assets.”
Kraken, one of the oldest and most-respected crypto asset exchanges, intends these moves to attract customers who need more immediate ability to move funds, providing flexibility lacking amongst some of its competitors.
The Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) published its fifth market surveillance report in September that verifies reporting of crypto asset exchange volumes. As part of its methodology, through its proprietary algorithm, BTI cleans all wash trading from exchanges’ volumes:
“Since the start of 2019, global wash trading has reduced by 35.7% among the real Top-40 exchanges. The process of sharing our data reports with many of these exchanges has resulted in enhanced mechanisms for detecting wash trading accounts and shutting them down,” the report read.
It reveals that the cleanest exchanges since its latest report continue to be Kraken, Coinbase, Poloniex, and UpBit.
Recently, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell spoke with YouTuber Ivan on Tech, discussing the demise of Altcoins and the strength of Bitcoin. He believes that hype surrounding altcoins in the cryptosphere will soon come to an end, saying:
In regards to Bitcoin, Powell says he never recommends shorting, saying that Kraken has “way more demand to go long Bitcoin, but we’ve only got so many dollars in the system. The margin pool for borrowing dollars to buy Bitcoin is constantly being exhausted, which I think is good. People are bullish.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coinjer Scam is Making the Rounds, Here’s What You Need to Know</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Coinjer scam is one of the latest cons to hit crypto-related social media recently. The scam primarily operates across Telegram channels and tricks people into coughing up bitcoin in order to receive more. 
The Coinjer scam is a relatively small-scale attempt to syphon away Bitcoin (BTC). The scheme offers a BTC reward, but ends up not paying it, a Reddit thread explains.
The messages spreading on Telegram promise that the user has won 0.25 BTC, and that they have to go and claim it. The Coinjer site then asks for registration. However, an actual withdrawal of 0.25 BTC is not allowed, so the user has to supply some more BTC to reach the threshold of 0.3 BTC.
However, Coinjer won’t pay even then. The scheme now requires more verification, including a KYC screening. There is also a cost for that – 0.1 BTC, as another user on Reddit noted. Thus, Coinjer not only steals BTC, but also potentially electronic and real-world identities too.
It seems the scheme has also moved beyond English-speaking social media, and now operates among Asian users too.
The Coinjer name also spoofs CoinJar, a legitimate crypto-payment service.
Coinjer has been called “the most elaborate crypto scam”, but it actually bears a lot of resemblance to old-fashioned mail-order scams, which required a payment to release the promised price. Even after paying up, the scams would typically continue to withhold the money.
Scams and attempts to take crypto coins usually accelerate during boom times, and fold during bear markets. Currently, the so-called Ethereum giveaway scams appear to have diminished from Twitter. At the same time, pyramid-like schemes reappear, usually attempting to contact naive investors directly.
In 2019, the PlusToken scam operated for months in China, taking away more than $3 billion in BTC. Additionally, the HEX scheme is now growing its base, attempting to take ETH tokens, but also potentially BTC.
Telegram has been one of the hotbeds for scam activity, including the spreading of faked ICO deposit addresses, tainted wallets, as well as impersonating ICO leaders. The Coinjer scam is directly asking for bitcoin, instead of attempting to sell another coin or token.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Human motion capture through a novel wearable multi-linkage sensory system</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the increasing demand for human-computer interaction in recent years, such as VR/AR, the medical industry, sport science measurement and film/entertainment industry, for instance, the development of motion tracking of the multi-linkage system has gradually attracted the attention not only from academic community but also industry sectors. The reason behind the increased attention is that the multi-linkage sensory system applies to posture measurement of the human body, as well as robotic arm applications. This so-called multi-linkage sensory system generally refers to a system consisting of multiple rigid bodies which are connected or related to each other. Each linkage is treated as a rigid body that can move in a 3-dimensional space in a non-detached manner in connection with other linkages, where each linkage maintains the property of rigidity. For example, the index finger is composed of three linkages connected through the finger joints to the palm.
Traditionally, devices to capture the object’s posture mainly rely on visually-based recognition. This measurement method uses the data captured from multiple calibrated cameras to obtain overlapping images, and the images are used to calculate the position and the posture of objects through the triangulation methods. Although the technology is mature and reliable, the cost of the devices is not economical and its application is limited by the measurement site and often encounters light-shielding problems.
Another inevitable problem is that the optical measurement method has the problem of line-of-sight shielding, that is being blocked by other objects. Once such a phenomenon occurs, the measured result will be inaccurate and most likely impossible to measure. This phenomenon usually appears while measuring complex and compact objects, such as the motion of the hand. For this specific reason, how to design wearable multi-linkage measurement system which can avoid the light-shielding, line-of-sight shielding and ambient light interference has also become an important issue in practical industrial applications.
This article discusses the patented work (U.S. Patent No. 10,299,731; Taiwan Patent No. I612276) of a novel wearable multi-linkage measurement system developed by Professor Chang’s group in National Tsing Hua University, of which work was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan. This object pose measurement system was based on inertial measurement units (IMU).
In each IMU, three types of sensors, such as an accelerometer, a magnetometer, and a gyroscope, are included and employed to measure the gravity, geomagnetic direction and the rotational speed of the object. With the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacture technique, the IMU sensor ship can be downsized as small as fingernails, suitable for creating a low-cost, highly wearable and even a portable motion capture system!
As illustrated in Figure 1(c), to capture all the motion of the human hand, 16 IMU sensors are required to record all the finger linkage’s motion of the hand. To be able to use so many sensors in the limited and crowded space on the hand to capture hand movements without affecting the operator’s hand movements, all of the components should be designed as small as they can.
As shown in Figure 1(a) when compared with the little finger and a penny, the printed circuit board with an IMU sensor chip is made only 1.2 mm thick and 8 mm wide. Each IMU sensor chipboard is secured in a 3D printed finger sleeve as shown in Figure 1(b) which is later worn on each finger linkage. Each IMU sensor board on the finger linkage is connected by cables to adjacent one via the finger joint. Based on adjacent IMU sensor’s acceleration, velocity and geomagnetic direction readouts, the shared finger joint’s angular displacement, velocity and acceleration can then be calculated in real-time.
To demonstrate the system capability in obtaining dexterous motion, the IMU sensor array is worn by a human hand and angles for the finger’s metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) and distal/ proximal interphalangeal (DIP/PIP) joints are obtained in real-time as shown in Figure 2(b). At the five depicted time instances, the hand’s gestures as shown in Figure 2(a) can be real-time captured by the system. The measured information by the sensor array system can then be used to render a virtual or digital representation of the corresponding hand gesture with a high level of accuracy.
As opposed to the conventional approach, the system validated by calibrated experiments indicates the inertial measurement system and this method can be used in monitoring hand and multi-linkage motions, calculating the angles of the joints, and even identifying gestures or motion with a satisfactory level of accuracy. The captured and processed information from the system can be further used to create the corresponding digital twin in the cyber-physical system. Not only human skills can be recorded by the system and digitally transformed when applied with artificial intelligence (AI), but the digitised skills can also be further evolved in the digital twin for endless applications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sony launches α9 II full-frame professional camera in South Africa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sony are making an impressive mark in the world of professional photography. They’ve just launched the Alpha A9 II in South Africa, which holds true to its promise of being built for speed.  The Alpha 9 II includes blackout-free continuous shooting at up to 20 frames per second, which when combined with the Auto Focus and Auto Exposure tracking, takes much of the hard work out of sports photography and photojournalism, and allows photographers to concentrate on image composition.
Sony made good on their commitment to listen to their customers when developing the Alpha 9 II.  They’ve incorporated a larger grip and have made buttons larger without being intrusive, making for a more comfortable experience, something photographers have thanked Sony for.   “The voice of our customers is critical to Sony – we are always listening,” said Murat Gebeceli, Head of Digital Imaging, Sony Middle East & Africa.
The camera continuously calculates Auto Focus and Auto Exposure up to 60 times per second thanks to the optimised Auto Focus algorithms.  This feature goes a long way in enhancing the experience of sports and wildlife photographers alike. Added to this is the offer of an anti-flicker shooting mode, which detects for and adjusts to artificial lighting, maximising image quality.
Fast-moving subjects are accurately captured by the Alpha 9 II through its 425 contrast Auto Focus points and 693 focal-plane phase-detection Auto Focus points that cover up to 93% of the image area. The performance of the Auto Focus delivers pin-sharp images and the Auto tracking locks onto the subject of the image, even when erratically moving around.  Once the subject is auto tracked the camera remains focused on it and negates any interference from objects or other subjects – even when they are present in the foreground. The Auto animal eye focus provides intense shots as the photographer can prepare their frame and composition without having to quickly focus on the eye and then have to jump to frame. The Auto Focus constantly tracks even when continuous shooting is greater than F16. This provides enhanced accuracy for shots requiring slower shutter speeds.
The Alpha 9 II Body is sturdy but lightweight and makes for easier transportation, taking a fair amount of strain off of the moving photographer.  The weather seal holds up to testing in 95% humidity, 46 Degree Celsius heat, dry and dusty conditions and even in heavy rain downpours. The silent photography offered by mirrorless cameras opens up a new world of possibilities for sports and wildlife photographers as they’re able to move closer to subjects and be far less intrusive than in years gone by.
In keeping up with the fast-paced world of journalism, the Alpha 9 II includes a built-in 1000BASE-T Ethernet terminal.  It also supports file transfer over SSL or TLS encryption and improves PC remote shooting performance. The camera’s built-in wireless LAN offers an impressive 5GHz.  The workflow of photographers, editors and clients is improved by including a Voice Memo function that translates voice notes to text files that are shared with the images, allowing for effective and speedy editing.  The camera also offers the ability to transfer image and voice notes via FTP without having to operate a smartphone. The FTP settings within the app can be sent to the camera using Bluetooth for even faster workflow.
The Alpha 9 II is available at leading retailers across South Africa, but will set you back approximately R84k. That’s an unfathomable amount of money, but this isn’t a camera for the everyman.   If you’re looking to impress friends and family with seemingly great photography skill, this may not be your number one choice. If however your bread and butter is dependent on a great shot, then the Alpha 9 II is worth considering.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Which shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise given that most have you only just remembered it was a thing after reading that headline.
It seems the fate of nearly every card game based on an existing franchise to go down the drain in a post-Hearthstone world. What with Valve recently retracting the DOTA 2 card game Artefact for a total rework, I doubt that it would come as much of a surprise to anyone that Bethesda’s The Elder Scrolls: Legends, based on the fantasy franchise of the same name, has officially been put on hold. While the game was announced all the way back in 2015 and later released in 2016, it’s not exactly the sort of experience that fans of The Elder Scrolls were looking for to bide time until the inevitable release of The Elder Scrolls 6, hence the cancellation of the project.
While all future developments have been put on hold, including the game’s upcoming expansion which was slated for release this quarter, The Elder Scrolls: Legends will remain playable and Bethesda will continue with monthly reward cards and in-game events, just don’t expect any substantial new content updates. The official statement posted on the game’s subbreddit reads:
As can be expected, most of the comments are largely from fans of the game expressing their sadness that Legends has essentially been cancelled. The Elder Scrolls: Legends was expected to receive a console port in the near future, although the likelihood of that happening at all now is obviously incredibly slim. The game is still available for free on PC, iOS and Android systems.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rocket League fans are so upset with the game’s microtransaction pricing that they’d rather have lootboxes back</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, Psyonix released the Blueprint update for Rocket League. It’s a notable update in that it’s the one that completely removes blind lootboxes, in favour of a much more transparent system. The system replaces crates and keys with Credit and Blueprints in the game’s newly implement in-game shop. The change was made to move away from gambling-styled loot-boxes in favour of transparency. Players earn credits, which they can use to effectively buy the cosmetics they want. Unfortunately, the price of those cosmetics is so ludicrously high that it’s annoying the game’s loyal fanbase.
It’s become such a point of contention that many are asking for lootboxes to come back. One of the reasons for that is because the lootboxes gave players a bunch of items that could be traded in the grey market. In this new system, there are top-tier items that on their own cost $20 – whereas with the loot box system that cash would have allowed players to earn at least 20 lootboxes containing all sorts of stuff.
“The new blueprint system is a complete rip-off,” says one of the game’s Steam players, Jyv, who has over 680 hours logged in Rocket League. “The prices are nowhere near the market price before the change… You used to spend 20 keys worth for 20 items if you open crates, now you use 20 keys worth to get one item from the shop.”
It’s a sentiment echoed by Pro Rocket League players too. G2’s Dillon ‘Rizzo’ Rizzo says that the update “fucking blows,”and isn’t pleased with the pricing on individual items.
Naturally, the game’s subreddit is full of complaints and memes about the egregious pricing. Says one upset redditor:
No new modes, no fixes for a lot of problems that people have been asking to be fixed for months. This whole update was a cash grab and I believe we the community are rightfully pissed. We thought you were different, we thought “oh psyonix won’t be like that they are a good company that cares about it’s player base” we now know you just want to squeeze every last dime out of us.”
There’s even a movement of sorts amongst players to stick to the base Stocktane car with no livery as some sort of protest about the cost of the new microtransactions.
Much of the blame has been levelled at Psyonix’s new boss Epic Games, who’ve implemented a similar store for microtransactions in its unfathomably popular Fortnite – though even that game isn’t quite so overzealous with its pricing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taotronics SoundSurge 46 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones review – Best bang-for-your buck Noise Cancelling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Noise-cancelling is the current trend in headsets, and it’s one that makes sense in an increasingly, busy cacophonous world. The current kings on that arena are still Sony and Bose, who make the very best sets available. They’re still far too expensive for most, but ubiquity has led to competition – not just with features and function, but also affordability.
Noise cancelling headsets now run the gamut from thousands of Rands, to less than a thousand, each offering varying features for their price. One of the best sets to find a good balance between price and performance that I’ve used is the Taotronics TT-BH22. Though it has a few design issues, it offered a warm and rich sound, with feedback noise cancelling that surpassed more expensive sets. The follow-up set, the Taotronics Soundsurge 46 not only has a better name but also switches to a better form of noise cancelling. Instead of the cheaper to implement single-microphone, there’s now also a second, external microphone to help filter out extraneous noise.
Funnily, it’s not as immediately impressive as the noise cancelling on the TT-BH22, but that’s because that set did a better job of passive noise isolation. It is, however, far better at reducing the constant hums of traffic, fans, air condition and the other churning, droning cacophony of everyday life. I found the set to be especially good at removing the sometimes-overwhelming din of being at gym. I’ve used it on a long-haul flight, and it worked better than I expected for the purpose, removing the terribly pervasive roar of plane engines. As with most noise-cancelling though, it’s not especially good at removing sharp sounds like clattering mechanical keyboards, barking dogs or the sound of Darryn screaming from the basement he’s currently locked in.
Its noise-cancelling however, isn’t its best feature. That honour goes to its wonderful fast-charging capabilities. Though the set, like its forebear, is still fitted with the soon-to-be-outdated micro USB port, it allows for fast-charging, letting you get a few hours of listening off a 5-minute charge. That’s a godsend if you’ve somehow forgotten to charge the thing and need to dash out, but also a necessity given that the Soundsurge 46 carries through one of the biggest design faults of the previous set. There’s a dedicated toggle switch for noise cancelling, which means that it’s far too easy to forget to switch it off, leaving the batteries draining while they’re cancelling sound for an audience of zero. It’s not a problem that’s unique to TaoTronics, but it would be nicer to have a software-controlled noise-cancelling function that switched itself off when the headset itself switches off. The noise-cancelling drains the battery fairly quickly, reducing the manufacturer’s promised 30 hours of battery life considerably. I generally got around 20 hours off a single charge, using the set wirelessly with noise cancelling on.
While the Soundsurge 46, with its deep 40mm drivers has a better overall sound than the TT-BH22, I prefer the latter’s tuning, though the bass here is less likely to fatigue. Most modern, expensive headsets favour a neutral, flat sound that highlights authenticity in sound reproduction, The Soundsurge 46 is tuned like many consumer headsets from years ago – with a larger focus on thumping, punchy bass. That’s not to say that they’re tuned poorly or sound bad by any means; I think the best descriptor for their signature is “fun.” Music has a good, deep thud, and – when combined with the noise cancelling – is a delightful aural cocoon. The bass may be at the forefront, but it’s by no means overpowering. Listening to bass-heavy music like Portishead’s 1994 masterpiece Dummy, right through to Fleetwood Mac’s seminal “Rumours” (the beginning thumps of “Second Hand News” come through beautifully), and more modern fare like Post Malone’s Sunflower and Tool’s Fear Inoculum, it all came through warmly. There is perhaps a bit of dynamism that’s lost in the highs and mids, but it’s never muddy.
Unfortunately, despite some reports to the contrary, the set only supports Bluetooth 4.2, and worse still is that it uses the SBC codec instead of more modern, less compressed ones like aptX and LDAC. Thankfully, unlike the TT-BH22, it still sounds good used wirelessly and without ANC. The call microphone uses Qualcomm’s cVc noise cancelling, but like many products in this category, voice calls can sound hollow as a result.
Aesthetics are subjective, but I like the design of the Soundsurge 46. Unlike the TT-BH22’s that blatantly copy the Bose Quiet Comfort II, these have an understated, almost industrial design. A little generic? Sure, but sleek. Unlike that set, it doesn’t fold up for travel, but is portable enough thanks to cups that swivel 180 on their hinges. They also swivel back and forth on those hinges, ensuring a comfortable fit. The headband is pliable enough that it’s not brittle but remains sturdy. The cups and the underside of the headband are decked with soft foam and protein leather, making for a comfortable fit. The included accessories are generous. Not only do you get the usual charging cable, but also a 3.5mm cable, an aeroplane adapter, and a handy, durable carry-case.
On the right cup, you’ve got a 3.5mm jack and the physical button to enable noise cancelling, along with three buttons that all serve double (and in some cases triple) duty. The power button is used not just to switch the set on and off, but also to enable pairing, while the volume buttons can also be used to skip through tracks and answer calls.
They’re available from Takealot for R1899.

    <h5 class="mb-1">It looks like Minecraft’s “Better Together” cross-platform update is finally coming to PlayStation 4</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year, Mojang (owned by Microsoft) released the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. Based on the code from the Pocket Edition, Bedrock unified the code for the game across all platforms, even allowing for cross platform play. Minecraft owners across PC, Xbox One, mobile and even Switch could play the game together, mining, crafting and doing whatever else people do in Minecraft.
The notable platform missing from that list? Yeah, the PlayStation 4 version. While it got the code updates, the PlayStation 4 version was stuck in its own walled, block garden as Sony was hesitant to cross-play. Earlier this year, Sony officially (but quietly) moved Cross Play out of beta, meaning that the feature was open to all developers provided they had the resources. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was the first game to have cross-play built-in right out of the gate, but it is slowly making its way to more games. And it looks like Minecraft on PS4 will finally get its “Better Together” update.
Tomorrow.
While Sony hasn’t said as much, retail listings (and indeed, physical copies) of the cross-play version of Minecraft for PS4 have popped up online, with a release date of 10 December. The date happens to coincide with Sony’s next State of Play episode, which is tomorrow, Tuesday, December 10 at 6am PT, 9am ET, 2pm UK, 4pm SAST.
What’s interesting is that players will need an Xbox account to join in on the cross-play fun (just as it is on the Switch), which means that Xbox Live is, in some capacity, on the PlayStation Network. Chalk this up as a rumour for now, but it’s almost certainly happening.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Volvo S90 and V90 Facelift Wear Useless Camouflage Winter Testing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arguably, every single Volvo model unveiled after Geely purchased the Swedish company has been a massive improvement from its predecessor, but the S90/V90 lineup is probably the best example.
Despite featuring transverse engines and an FWD-based architecture, they have similar premium proportions as their German RWD rivals from BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Together with the “Thor's hammer” headlamp design and Scandinavian minimalist interiors, the two models represent the best that Volvo has to offer nowadays.
That said, even best-sellers need refreshing from time to time, especially since both have been continuously built with the same design since 2016. To be officially unveiled in the first half of 2020, the revamped Volvo S90 and V90 are currently cold-weather testing near the Arctic Circle.
Since the original recipe appears to still work, we won't be seeing an entirely different car when the facelift comes out, with Volvo choosing to keep the exterior modifications to the minimum.
In fact, we don't even understand why engineers bothered to camouflage parts of the prototypes, drawing even more attention from spy photographers in the process. The only exterior differences will be found in the lower part of the bumpers and the taillights.
The main changes will be found inside, where a new infotainment system is expected to find its home, while most of the engine lineup will be completely revamped to feature the 48-volt mild-hybrid technology already used on the refreshed XC90 II and the XC60 crossovers.
Thanks to an integrated starter-generator that can either reduce engine load or simply boost it to offer better acceleration in certain driving scenarios, the facelifted S90 and V90 should feel slightly sportier in a straight line while offering improved fuel economy. Obviously, the T8 AWD Twin Engine version will still feature a plug-in hybrid setup.
New exterior and interior colors are also expected, with the upholstery and cockpit design to be slightly refreshed as well. 🏁

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Jaguar I-Pace Update Offers 234 Miles of Range Thanks to eTrophy Know-How</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The redesigned F-Type may be the most important Jaguar of the moment, but the I-Pace hasn’t been forgotten either. In production since 2018 at the Magna Steyr plant in Austria, the electric SUV gains 12 more miles of range for 2020 thanks to a software update.
Jaguar says that the eTrophy – serving as the support series for Formula E since 2019 – has helped the engineers and software developers to better understand what can be improved about the road-going model. Other than that, more than 50 million miles of real-world driving have been scrutinized to leverage the optimum efficiency settings.
Optimizations to the all-wheel-drive torque management, battery, and thermal systems are in store. The 90-kWh pack and dual-motor setup are now capable of 234 miles of range on a full charge. That’s 377 kilometers in European currency, which is adequate for an SUV this sporty. But better still, the update comes at no charge to the customer.
The software that Jaguar developed for the 2020 model year helps the battery run in a lower state of charge. The thermal management system, meanwhile, is programmed to close the active radiator vanes more frequently to improve aerodynamics. As for the all-wheel-drive system, the torque distribution between the front and rear motors promises superior efficiency only when the I-Pace is driven in ECO Mode.
Even the regenerative braking system has been improved by harvesting more energy at lower driving speeds. The algorithm in charge of predictive range calculation now offers a more accurate and consistent estimate according to Jaguar’s press release.
“The I-Pace eTrophu has generated a huge amount of data for us to analyze and those marginal gains, derived from competition on the track, are now being applied to customers’ cars to further enhance their driving experience,” said vehicle engineering manager Stephen Boulter. “The new software updates optimize the powertrain control systems to improve efficiency and allow drivers to travel even further on a single charge without any hardware changes – it really is a case of the vehicle getting better with age.”
One last additional change is the software-over-the-air functionality, which means that owners will no longer need to drive to the dealership in order to receive fresh software and functionalities. For the time being, Jaguar hasn’t released any information about what kind of OTA improvements will be made in the coming months for existing models and the 2020 I-Pace. 🏁

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla’s Cybertruck Might Be Cursed as Second Showing Comes With Another Blunder</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since its launch in November, Tesla’s Cybertruck has managed to divide the automotive world into two big categories. Everyone agrees though that with its completely atypical style, whether you like it or not, the futuristic-looking electric pickup turns heads.
Following the unfortunate turn of events that took place during the presentation of the new EV pickup, where both side front and rear windows broke during a durability demonstration, it was kind of a mystery as to what would happen from a marketing point of view, given that the unveiling didn’t go quite as Tesla expected.
So it took about two weeks for Elon Musk to take the wheel of his new toy in an unconventional test drive, as he drove the Cybertruck to Nobu, a celebrity-packed restaurant in Malibu, together with singer Grimes and the design director from his company, Franz von Holzhausen.
After leaving the truck near the entrance of the restaurant for everyone to see, the curse of the Cybertruck strikes again, as upon leaving, Elon Musk hits what appears to be a cone from the parking lot of the restaurant. No harm was done, but the internet kind of lost its mind that the Tesla CEO didn’t even flinch after running over an obstacle, not a lot smaller than a toddler.
I said unconventional test drive because we're not sure the prototype is road legal, and there’s hardly any real testing happening during a night out. 
The car did appear to have distinct headlights, a design that looks a bit different from what was presented back in November, so one might think that other adjustments were made as well to safely conduct this marketing exercise. But truth be told we haven’t noticed any. Also, we don’t know if the truck has some sort of cameras and cockpit displays to replace the missing side mirrors.
Couple that with the giant tires that are probably not that smooth, and the insulation from the “shock resistant” windows and steel panels, and it’s likely that Elon didn’t even notice that he ran over that cone.

Then again, while the GM halo car is as real as they get, even with the $20,000 loss expected on the base $60,000 model, the next-generation Nissan halo car sitting before us comes in the form of a rendering.
Brought to us by the brilliant mind of digital artist Rain Prisk, this rendering was inspired by the most impressive R35 incarnation to date, namely the GT-R50 whose body was shaped by Italdesign.
However, the pixel wielder took the design DNA of the Italian-styled Godzilla, of which only 50 are being built (each comes at a price of €990,000 plus taxes) and integrated it into a mid-engined concept.
Of course, the more dramatic change involves pushing the greenhouse towards the front of the car, all to make room for that engine. As such, the side of the vehicle now features the kind of air intakes you'd expect from this kind of supercar, while the fuselage-like aero work reminds us of the second-generation Ford GT.
Now, since the C8 'Vette offers such an affordable mid-engined package and the current R35 GT-R has established a reputation as a supercar killer on a budget, one could expect the Japanese carmaker to turn the next-gen R36 into a rival for the Chevy halo car. However, holding your breath for such an event doesn't seem appropriate.
For one thing, while Nissan has assured us the GT-R has a future, the company hasn't mentioned any details, in spite of the fact that the present model has been with us since 2007. Speaking of which, while the original, 2008 model year GT-R started at $69,850, the range-topping 2020 GT-R Nismo kicks off at $212,435, which hints at upmarket intentions.
Besides, the current layout of the Nissan GT-R offers 2+2 seating, thus allowing the machine to stay true to the first two letters of its name (one shouldn't overlook the practicality aspects of go-fast machines), so a mid-engined evolution would also bring this drawback on top of the expected price boom. 🏁

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Mercedes-Benz GLA Prototype Strips 2 Days Before Official Reveal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A little over six years have passed since the original Mercedes-Benz GLA (X156) was unveiled as the smallest crossover in the Mercedes-Benz lineup and its replacement's reveal is just around the corner.
Unless it gets leaked, we will get to see the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLA without any camouflage in less than 48 hours, as the crossover is set for a December 11 online reveal, and Mercedes-Benz has already teased the model on more than one occasion.
Caught by our collaborating spy photographers being tested around the streets of Stuttgart alongside a pre-facelift Mercedes-Benz GLC, the new GLA seems quite a bit bigger than its predecessor.
Slightly longer and taller, the car also seems to have much higher ground clearance, almost identical to the more SUV-like GLC that's following close behind. Mercedes-Benz might have responded to the first-generation GLA's criticism, with many people seeing it more like a raised hatchback than the crossover it so desperately tried to be.
The current generation had a so-called “off-road package” as an option on some markets, which raised the ground clearance a further 2 cm (0.8 inches) alongside other “rugged” modifications. That said, the car in the spy photo gallery looks like it's ready for some off-roading at the mall parking lot with those 21-inch wheels and minuscule tire walls.
Based on the same MFA2 (Modular Front-wheel-drive Architecture 2) platform as the latest A-Class, B-Class, CLA and the first generation of the GLB 7-seat crossover, the all-new GLA will feature similar interior design and an identical engine lineup.
This translates into an assortment of 1.3-liter and 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engines and 1.5 and 2.0-liter diesels, paired with either front-wheel-drive for the less powerful versions and AWD for the others. A plug-in hybrid version and two Mercedes-AMG versions will become available later on in the product-cycle.
You will get the choice of rowing your own with a six-speed manual transmission but two dual-clutch transmissions will also be available - a 7-speed and an 8-speed one for the more powerful engine versions. 🏁

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Based on the short story The Greatest Gift, It's A Wonderful Life was produced and directed by Frank Capra in 1946 and was nominated for five Academy Awards.
It's one of the better-known Christmas films, focusing on a frustrated businessman (James Stewart) who is contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve when he is intercepted by his guardian angel (Henry Travers) who shows him what life would be like without him in it. Here's how to watch It's A Wonderful Life online or on any mobile device.
In the UK, It's A Wonderful Life can be streamed for free if you subscribe to the NowTV Cinema pass. This costs £11.99 per month, but a free trial is available - sign up to NowTV here.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Though since supplanted by the OnePlus 7T, the OnePlus 7 is still worth considering if you can find it, especially since it's now cheaper than ever. The 7 Pro, more excitingly, features a 6.67in super-smooth 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display and a pop-up selfie camera. This removes the notch and maximises screen space. The 7 Pro also features a triple-lens rear camera. 
Read our reviews of the OnePlus 7 Pro and OnePlus 7 if you still need to decide – and see how the two phones compare.
The 7 Pro 5G version includes Qualcomm's X50 modem, which allows the phone to connect to 5G networks, where available. See our separate round-up of the best 5G phones deals for other 5G handsets worth considering.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to set up a smart home security camera</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Whether you want to monitor your pets, ensure no-one tries to steal your stuff or if you just want to see what's happening at home, a Wi-Fi camera makes it easy to do so.
They start from around £20 / $20, and even for that tiny sum you can get great-quality live video on your phone wherever you can get a 3G, 4G (or even 5G) signal. Try the Neos SmartCam, for example.
Modern security cameras are straightforward to install for the most part, especially for indoor models. It can be a little more challenging installing an outdoor camera, but the same principles apply. Plus, there are some great smart doorbells which are effectively Wi-Fi cameras with a button so you get an alert when someone's at the door.
The setup process varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but almost all now use a phone app that guides you through the steps you need to take.
There are two main types of camera: those with Wi-Fi only and those which also have Bluetooth. It can be easier to set up a camera with Bluetooth since you don't have to switch between Wi-Fi networks. But makers have come up with some nifty solutions for models without Bluetooth.
Certain models don't need you to enter your Wi-Fi details at all because they're taken straight from your phone or scanned. With others, you might need to scan a QR code or type in a unique identifier. If the camera is compatible with Apple HomeKit, you may need an iPhone or iPad to set it up and scan the HomeKit code.
Here's we use a Nest Outdoor camera so you can see the process from start to finish, but here's a quick summary that should apply to most home security cameras:
Don't drill any holes or mount your camera before you've set it up and got it working. It's best to plug it in near your router to start with, then move it to the room or position you want to monitor later. That way you can check there's a strong enough Wi-Fi signal.
This is especially important for outdoor cameras where you will need both a power source - ideally a waterproof outdoor socket - and a strong Wi-Fi signal.
It is also well worth getting someone to hold the camera in the desired position to check that it will give you the view you need. Lenses play a big part here as they determine the field of view: some offer a wider angle than others.
If you are installing outdoor cameras, be sure to abide by all local laws concerning privacy and - if necessary - put up appropriate signage to warn visitors to your property that they may be recorded. The usual 'CCTV in operation' signs are widely available.
Don't attempt to conceal or hide the cameras. Their presence acts as a deterrent to thieves.
Position is important for any camera. Obviously mount it so it can cover the area you want to monitor, but bear in mind that pointing it at a window could lead to false notifications of movement, and sunlight streaming in and shining directly at the camera can render the footage useless.
The same goes for outdoor cameras, which should ideally be mounted in a sheltered spot out of the rain. They may be water-resistant, but water on the lens will reduce the amount of detail you can see.
Virtually all cameras have night vision which uses infrared LEDs to see in the dark. This tends to lead to black-and-white video, but note the LEDs will reflect off glass. That means you can't place an indoor camera against a window to monitor the outside. It'll work ok during the day, but you won't see anything except the reflection of the LEDs at night.
First, get everything out of the box, make sure nothing is missing and look for a setup guide that tells you which app to download. Sometimes there are subtly different apps from the same manufacturer. Some cameras use a generic app, and there may be a choice of apps so you may have to download more than one and choose whichever you like the best.
Download the app, open it and see whether you need to create an account. Typically you do, as you need a username and password to log in an get access to the camera's video feed. Some cameras even have a password which you have to enter before you can view the live stream within the app, but you should have to enter this only once.
We're setting up a Nest Outdoor camera here. As mentioned above, it's important to set it up indoors first before mounting it outside.
So plug in the power cable and turn on the switch at the socket. Wait for an indication that the camera has power and then go to the app and find the option to set up a new device.
In the Nest app, that's found by tapping the cog icon at the top-right of the main home screen and then tapping Add product from the menu.
This is where camera set up varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but Nest makes things simple as you just have to point your phone's camera at the QR code printed on the device.
It may then ask you to turn on power to the camera, but if that's already done, tap Next and wait for the camera to be discovered.
If you have a camera with no Bluetooth, it's likely you'll have to go to your phone's settings and look for the camera's own Wi-Fi network and connect to it before switching back to the app to continue setup.
Once the app has connected to the camera, it will configure the Wi-Fi settings so it can get internet access. That might happen automatically, or you'll have to pick the network yourself and type in the password.
Usually, once that's done you'll see the live video preview from the camera after a short wait.
Depending on the camera, you might be asked to set the location and time zone and even motion detection zones at this point.
However, don't forget to mount the camera in the place it will live before choosing which area to monitor for motion.
That could be as simple as putting it on a shelf, desk or table and plugging it in, or as complex as drilling holes for a wall or ceiling mount and nailing in clips to run the power cable safely along the wall.
When the camera is in place, you can use the app to set the areas you want to monitor for motion (if supported), when you want the camera to record and choose other options.
Sometimes, you can't access all settings from the phone app. And that's also the case with Nest. If you want to set up Activity Zones, for example, you must use a laptop or PC and sign into your account on Nest's website home.nest.com.
Last, find the notifications settings and choose how you want to receive them. The most useful is to get an alert when the camera detects motion, but you might also be able to be notified if there's an unusual noise and also turn off notifications at certain times.
Also, some cameras allow you to choose when they're recording, with some using your phone's location to switch on recording when you leave the house and stop when you return - useful for indoor cameras.

When buying a speaker online, it’s hard to know what to expect without having first heard the speaker, but here are a few things to look out for.
Power rating and sound
The volume of a speaker depends on the output power, which is the watts rating. The higher the watts, the higher the sound. On portable speakers, usually 15 to 20W should offer sufficient power for 80dB of sound, which is loud enough for indoor and outdoor use.
Smaller speakers have a lower wattage due to the size, but some can pack power too. One of our favourites is the Aukey Eclipse Bluetooth speaker, which ranked first place in our our round up of the best cheap Bluetooth speakers and offers 20W of power despite its small frame.
Keep in mind, listening at full volume can also cause distortions.
Bluetooth 4.0 vs Bluetooth 5.0
Some speakers may offer Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. The benefit of Bluetooth 5.0 is that it has greater range, uses less power to broadcast, and can even allow you to stream to two devices at the same time. Most of the latest phones, from the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 8 onwards for example, come with Bluetooth 5.0, so it’s worth checking if your phone does as well.
However, while a speaker that offers the latest version of Bluetooth may seem like an upgrade from one that doesn’t, you won’t see the difference unless both your phone and the speaker have Bluetooth 5.0 compatibility.
Battery life
Battery life becomes an important feature when buying a portable speaker. On average, portable speakers offer about 7 to 10 hours per charge, so anything that offers less isn’t worth it.
Ultimate Ears’s Megablast Bluetooth speakers, which is also Alexa-enabled, is one of the best with a strong bass sound and a 12 hour battery life – rather, 16 hours in practice as we found in our review. It retails at £269.99/US249, but we've seen discounts as low as £140 off, so deals in this range are worth pouncing on.
Amazon has some of the biggest bargains, but if you find that you’re missing out on Amazon’s Lightning deals, which run for just a few hours and offer limited stock, we'd recommend signing up for Amazon's 30 day free trial of Prime, which will get you access to deals 30 minutes before everyone else. Plus, you'll get free next-day delivery with the Prime trial, as well as access to Prime Instant Video and more.
Sign up for Prime now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amazon Christmas deal cuts £72 off Fitbit Versa – cheapest price ever</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deals from Amazon haven't ended. After its Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in November the retailers now gears up for Christmas with its Last Minute Christmas Deals sale that ends 22 December. You'll find a whole host of discounts already, but one that's particularly worth checking out is the £72 discount on the original Fitbit Versa, which is now £127.99.
The Special Edition also has a discount and is now £149.50, which slashes about £70 off the original £219 price tag. These prices have carried on from the Black Friday period and are the cheapest its ever been on Amazon, while also being the cheapest price around across all major retailers right now.
While the newer Versa 2 released earlier this year, Amazon's deal on the original Versa makes it easy to recommend – the features across the two models are practically the same. What you get with the Versa 2 are slight improvements in screen size and design and a stronger battery life. To be precise, the Versa 2's screen is 8% bigger and is an AMOLED display, which means colours are more vivid and blacks are more intense. Other notable changes is the addition of the Amazon Alexa smart-assistant, an NFC chip for contactless payment, and access to Spotify controls (tethered to your phone).
While these features are all nice to have, the core fitness tracking features remain the same across the two models, which is why we highly recommend Amazon's deal if you want to save on a powerful smart watch this Christmas. Of course, if you don't mind paying sightly more for the additional features on new model, Amazon has £30 off the Versa 2 as well.
We've compared the Versa 2 to the original Versa if you want to get a sense of all its differences in more detail. Also see our full review of the original Versa.
Below, you can see the prices of the Versa and Versa 2 using our live comparison tool, but we're also handpicking the best Fitbit Christmas deals across the range in our dedicated round-up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Graphics Card Deals for Christmas 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Buying a graphics card is a big investment so you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the one that suits your needs. We’ve got the best graphics cards deals right here, along with some advice on which one to buy.
If you’re planning on building a gaming PC then your graphics card is going to be the very heart of your rig. Combined with the CPU, the GPU is the deciding factor in what graphical settings you can run your game at and the frame rate it will be able to sustain.

If you want the top of the line Nvidia, here's a better than nothing £20 off the RTX 2080. This Auros model has a Windforce Stack 3x 100mm cooling system.
Nvidia's RTX range of graphics cards is the obvious choice for a current gen card. However, if you can't afford one then there are still decent GTX GPUs on offer. Take a look at our review of the GTX 1080 and the 1060 Ti is a good choice, too.
Thanks to the influx of cryptocurrency mining and the increased production price of RAM along with Nvidia’s market dominance in this particular area, graphics cards have not been cheap over the past few years.
There are a couple of important factors to consider when purchasing a graphics card. First, you’ll need to think about what exactly you’re going to be using the card for. If you’re mainly playing World of Warcraft, League of Legends or Dota 2 then you’re not going to need a 1080 Ti to run those games on high settings at a decent frame rate.
On the other hand, if you’re determined to play the latest and greatest games at the very highest settings then you’ll want a more powerful card.
The resolution that you play your games at is very important when selecting a card. If you’re playing on a 1080p display then you’re not going to have much trouble getting solid performance, but if you’re using a 2k or 4k screen then you’ll need a faster card to cope with the demand from the monitor.
The same goes with the refresh rate on your monitor. If you’ve gone out of your way to purchase a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor then you’ll need a machine that can reach those frame rates on your desired graphics settings, so it’s worth it to keep that in mind.
Lastly, thinking about roughly how long you’ll be keeping your system is important too. You may think a 1080 Ti is more expensive but if it’s going to give you better performance and last longer in your rig before you replace it, in reality, it may be the better value purchase.
A graphics card is not exactly an inexpensive purchase, so make sure you’re getting the most bang for your buck with the offers below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Ethernet switches, Hubs & Splitters 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Often, there simply aren’t enough network sockets on a router for all the devices that need to connect to it. And while you might be able to use Wi-Fi for many gadgets, sometimes it’s preferable to use a wire for the best performance.
For example, gamers will prefer to use an Ethernet cable for their PC, laptop or games console for any online gaming to reduce lag, while a NAS drive will only really offer the fastest speeds for file transfers and streaming video around your home if you use a cable instead of Wi-Fi.
Fortunately, it’s cheap and easy to add more ports to your router by connecting an unmanaged switch.
That’s a rather grand title for a little box of network sockets, and it works much like a mains extension lead that provides multiple power sockets from just one wall socket.
In the same way, you can connect an Ethernet switch (also known as a hub or splitter) to a single port on your router and add either four or seven extra ports. Then, you can hook up your Xbox, TV, PC and any other wired network device and it will work as if it were connected directly to your router.
If you need to put the switch in a different room to your router then you could connect the two with a pair of powerline adapters - it will make the connection slower, but it will at least make it possible without running a long network cable.
Because these are ‘unmanaged’ it means they are plug-and-play. There’s no configuration necessary: they just work. And for home use, that’s absolutely fine: there’s rarely a reason why you would need the web interface and advanced settings of a managed switch: those are designed for business use.
This means that there’s not a great deal of difference between unmanaged switches from different brands. But there are subtle differences which can make one more attractive than another, whether it’s the placement of the power connector, the orientation of the ports or even the visibility of the LEDs.
Price and warranty also come into it, as does construction and aesthetics, although the latter won’t be a high priority for many.
One point you will need to be careful of: here we’ve rounded up Gigabit models. They’re full-duplex which means they can operate at 1000Mbps in both directions (i.e. sending and receiving) simultaneously.
If you see a cheaper option, it’s likely to be a 10/100Mbps version. This means the ports are limited to 100Mbps in each direction, and so are ten times slower. It’s never worth saving a few pounds or dollars for such a big compromise. Even if all the devices you need to connect are 10/100 right now, you’ll be glad you went for a Gigabit switch when you acquire a device that needs those Gigabit speeds.
None of these switches come with network cables, but we’ve taken the hassle out of choosing them: these are the best Ethernet cables.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Microsoft Surface Deals for Christmas 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over the years, Microsoft has proven that it's Surface devices are not only here to stay but they are some of the best Windows devices around competing with the likes of Dell, Lenovo and HP. There's a wide range of options so you'll find a Surface that's right for your needs and we've found all the best deals and discounts available.
The Surface range boasts a sleek and powerful line of touchscreen laptops, 2-in-1 tablets, and all-in-one PCs too. They pack stunning displays, speed and versatility into slick, lightweight designs, breaking the old notion of PCs as clunky business computers. On the contrary, these premium PCs are closer to Apple MacBooks and iPads and sometimes outperform them.
That said, Surface devices can be expensive, reaching well into the thousands depending on the model and configuration you choose. That’s why we’ve rounded up the best Surface offers out there, along with buying advice, so you can spot the deals from the duds. This is the current range:
Here's how much the Surface Pro 6 costs today from all of the major retailers.
Keep in mind Surface Pro tablets don’t come with the Type Cover or other accessories, so you will have to buy them separately. This mounts on to the price which is why we recommend looking for bundle deals, whichever retailer you shop from. Alternatively, if you do not find a bundle, it's a good idea to check if the discount offered is significant enough to offset the price of buying accessories separately.
Type Covers, the detachable keyboards for Surface tablets, will probably be the most useful accessory to buy. There are two version, so ensure the one you buy is compatible with the Surface model you have. The Surface Go Type Cover usually retails for £99.99/$129.99 while the Surface Pro Type Cover retails at £149.99/$159.99.
We've also listed the RRPs for other Surface accessories below so it's easier to spot how much you're really saving. Some retailers can inflate the original price to make a discount look greater than it really is.
With the release of the Surface Pro 6, you can expect to see deals and discounts on older Surface Pro models. The first place to check for deals is at the Microsoft store itself. For instance, you can now get a Surface Pro (5th gen) for £649.
Also check out the Surface deals page where, at the time of writing, you can save over £500. When Microsoft offers deals, other retailers may also follow suit, so knowing Microsoft’s discount is a useful indicator of how much you’re actually saving. Remember to compare the specs of the model you’re buying against the price set by Microsoft for the same configuration.
Retailers sometimes unfairly use images of the Surface tablets with the Type Cover as well, even though the Type Cover is not included. Ensure you double check the details before adding to cart. 
Of course, comparing prices against different retailers and e-retailers such as the ones below is always a good idea:
If you shop on Amazon, signing up for a Prime membership can also get you free next day delivery and access to limited-time Lightning Deals 30 minutes before non-members. You can sign up for a 30-day free trial, which you can cancel any time.
With so many models about, the year of the model on offer also affects the price. The latest version may not have the most competitive discount, while an older model with a competitive discount may not have the most advanced specs.
If you’re happy with an older model of a Surface device that’s been pre-owned, you could save shopping refurbished. We would recommend that the model you buy is certified refurbished, as these are rigorously tested and backed by Microsoft to work like new. You also get a one-year hardware warranty.
Refurbished deals can be found directly on Microsoft’s site. Keep checking if there's nothing in stock.
Microsoft also offers up to 10% discounts to students, parents and teachers and includes a range of devices.
Tech Advisor’s dedicated student deals site is another place to get a discount on Microsoft Surface products. Currently, there is also a 10% off code from Currys which you can redeem online or in store. You will need to create a Student Beans account to access these discounts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Should I buy from Kickstarter?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kickstarter is an exciting place where you can find products that aren’t available on any other site. Except this isn't an alternative Amazon or ebay. No. While it looks as though you can buy a product in the same way, it's completely different. 
Like Indegogo, Kickstarter is a crowdfunding website where innovators ask for money so they can build the products they are advertising. If you 'back' the project with your cash, it adds towards to goal, but even if the target amount is reached, you still may never receive the product, and we'll explain why. 
It doesn’t take long to find something on Kickstarter that catches the eye. At the time of writing we discovered a brand new reworking of the table-top Car Wars game by legendary designer Steve Jackson, an artbook consisting of over 100 photos taken by drones all over the world, and a comic book where a boy has to save his sister from a hospital filled with Nazis! Not bad at all.
Now, while these may all be tempting, it’s very important to take note of the pledge amount, the goal, and how many days or hours remain of the campaign. This is because all products listed on Kickstarter are in development. You’re not buying a finished product, at least not yet, instead you’re investing in the potential of it becoming a reality. 
Hopeful creators put up the campaigns to get backing from interested consumers, then once the target has been reached, they begin production. While this is a great way for new and exciting products to come onto the market, it’s not without its risks.
In the past, purchasers (sorry, investors) have found the final products they received were disappointing due to changes in production that meant the different materials were used or the design was altered. That’s preferable to the scenario where some products are fully backed - the goal was met - but the products never materialised at all due to the company going into bankruptcy or encountering manufacturing issues.
The latter was the case with the famous ZANO drone that raised more the £2.3m ($3m) from backers. But the company couldn’t produce a fully working product before it fell into too much debt to continue. A handful of backers received their drones, albeit ones that couldn't fly, while the rest were left out of pocket with nothing to show for their investment.
In a recent article, The Guardian reported that ‘9% of projects failed to deliver rewards as promised’, which in business terms could be regarded as a success – after all that means 91% of new ventures make it to market – but if you’re thinking from the perspective of a standard consumer then a 1-in-10 chance that the item you order and pay for isn’t going to ever arrive can be something of a shock.
Even if the product does arrive, there’s a good chance that it will take much longer than you’re used to with Amazon. In these days of next-day delivery, having to wait months or in some cases years for something to turn up on your doorstep can be equally disappointing.
That may be ok if you're only spending a small amount and can afford to lose it, but probably not if you're keen to get the latest electric bike or anything else that costs a lot of money. In that case you may be better off buying from a company that is actually selling a product.
So, in short. If you’re backing a project on Kickstarter you need to bear in mind that there is a small chance you will never see anything for your money and a much larger probability of it taking far longer to arrive than you’d normally expect.
No. Kickstarter sees itself as a conduit between creators and potential customers, but nothing more. On the Kickstarter site it states explicitly, ‘Kickstarter does not issue refunds. Transactions are between backers and creators directly. To request a refund for a pledge, please contact the project creator.’
If you’re lucky then the creator may issue one, but the chances are if the product is delayed then there could be money problems that are causing the holdup.
One exclusion from this policy is if the project doesn’t actually reach its target by the end of the campaign. As no money is taken while a campaign is active, you won’t be charged if the pledged amount comes up short.
Absolutely not. While there might be the occasional horror story, remember that over 90% of projects deliver their intended creations. It just requires a slightly different mindset to regular shopping. With Kickstarter you’re helping bring a new idea or product to life and one that wouldn’t have the chance to exist without your investment.
As with any form of gambling, even with odds as good as those on Kickstarter, just stick to the golden rule of never investing more than you can afford to lose.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Budget Laptop Deals: Christmas Deals Under £300</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon's Christmas Sale is now live, with up to 25% off selected laptops. But even with the discount some might still be above your budget this Christmas time.
Fortunately, it's not the only place to find a cheap laptop, with all manner of retailers pulling some seriously attractive deals out of the bag ahead of Christmas. But budget laptops do not hang around for long, so if you see a spec you like at a price you like, snap up that laptop.
As we outline below, you'll find various specifications available below £300. The best deal is likely to be an Intel Core i3 laptop with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of solid-state storage or a 1TB hard drive, and a 15.6in HD screen. You can find many laptops with full-HD panels at this price too, but beware of them reducing the spec elsewhere to accommodate a sub-£300 price.
From: AmazonNow: £179.99  (Free Office) View Deal
A great deal on a bundle that includes a basic Windows 10 S laptop with Microsoft Office subscription.
From: eBuyerWas: £299.99Now: £279.90  (£20.09 off) View Deal
Though the Black Friday discount itself isn't huge, this is a cracking laptop under £300. Offering double the memory and solid-state storage of most laptops at this price (8GB/256GB), it also has a 15.6in Full-HD screen, a Ryzen 3 processor, Windows 10 Home AND a DVD drive.
From: Laptops DirectWas: £329.97Now: £264.97  (£65 off) View Deal
Now with £65 off the price, this Aspire 3 laptop is arguably the most appealing of those listed here, with both a 15.6in full-HD screen and the best processor, the Ryzen 3 (also from AMD).
From: CurrysWas: £349Now: £249  (£100 off) View Deal
One of several variations of the Acer Aspire 3, this one has an AMD processor and a 14in screen.
From: ArgosWas: £329.99Now: £269.99  (£60 off) View Deal
Slightly more expensive than the Aspire 3 listed above, this model swaps out the SSD for an expansive 1TB HDD and comes in a flashy red colour.
From: AmazonWas: £299.99Now: £269  (£30.99 off) View Deal
By swapping out the AMD A9 for the more power-efficient A6, at the same price Acer is able to include a 15.6in screen. This budget laptop also has a 1TB HDD for storage.
From: CurrysWas: £379Now: £259  (£120 off) View Deal
A fantastic deal on a Windows 10 S laptop under £300, but if portability isn't everything save some money and get a larger screen on the 15.6in full-HD model above. Both have the same core spec with the Ryzen 3-3200U chip, 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD.
From: Laptop OutletWas: £379.99Now: £299.96  (£80 off) View Deal
The highest-storage option in our round-up of budget laptop deals under £300, this Lenovo laptop has a 2TB hard drive - perfect if your storage needs are great. It also runs a Core i3 processor and has a 15.6in HD screen.
From: CurrysWas: £399Now: £299  (£100 off) View Deal
Though you can find better value for money in the laptops higher up our list (while stocks last), no-one can complain about a 15.6in Windows 10 S laptop with a Core i3 processor at £299.
From: CurrysWas: £239Now: £239  (Free Office) View Deal
If you just need a basic laptop without breaking the bank then this is bargain from HP, with a no-frills AMD A4 processor that isn't the fastest you'll find in the budget market but capable for most daily computing tasks. It's got what you need, plus includes a one-year subscription to Office 365 with 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage.
From: AmazonWas: £249.99Now: £214.99  (£35 off) View Deal
Much like a Chromebook, this CloudBook from Asus has a browser-based operating system that enables it to run on some pretty low-power hardware, hence the cheap price. Note the inclusion of a one-year subscription to Office 365, which could make this an ideal laptop for homework.
From: AmazonWas: £299Now: £239.54  (£60.45 off) View Deal
Cheaper than Acer's other Chromebooks, this model is also more easily portable with a 14in HD screen. It runs an Intel Celeron chip and has 32GB of solid-state storage, which sounds meagre but should be plenty given that you'll be interacting with its browser-based OS.
From: AmazonWas: £279.99Now: £248  (£31.99 off) View Deal
A great deal on a budget laptop running Chrome OS, this Acer model has a 15.6in HD screen and an AMD A4 processor. Step up to a full-HD screen and the AMD A6 chip for an extra £13.99.
From: AmazonWas: £189.99Now: £142.99  (£47 off) View Deal
Save with this super cheap iOTA laptop, which has a 360 convertible hinge, a touchscreen and Windows 10 - but don't expect miracles from it, this is a low-power laptop.
From: AmazonWas: £179Now: £99.99  (£71.01 off) View Deal
If you simply need a laptop for a little cost as possible then check out the iOTA Flo. This little 11.6in laptop might not have very powerful specs but it will handle basic tasks if you just need to do things like email and word processing.
We review budget laptops all year round, and our favourite model right now is the HP 250 G7. It was on sale at just £289.92 at eBuyer, but unfortunately is now out of stock, which is why we urge you to snap up these cheap laptops while you can - but do keep your wits about you. Often the way to get down laptop prices is to reduce the spec, and that model came with a Core i3 processor, 4GB of memory and a 128GB solid-state storage drive, whereas the model we reviewed has a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD (also discounted at eBuyer to £397.98).
For many people that cheaper option is going to be more than enough for their needs, but it goes to show that when buying budget laptops you should be aware of small differences in the spec - and it always helps to have some idea of what to look out for in the first place. This way, if you see a great laptop deal we haven't mentioned here, you'll be able to work out whether or not it's a good buy.
Key things to look out for are the processor, memory and both type of storage and amount of storage. At under £300 you're unlikely to find anything higher than an Intel Core i3/AMD A-series or Ryzen 3 processor; if you do find a Core i5, snap up that laptop right away.
You'll also see Intel Pentium and Celeron processors listed, and these are less powerful options often found in older models and Chromebooks/CloudBooks, but still more than capable if your needs are low. By that we mean you're looking for something that's good for homework, replying to emails, browsing the web and social media, and watching the odd video.
These chips will have integrated graphics, and you should not expect to find a dedicated graphics card at this price. Your laptop will be more than capable of playing YouTube and movies, plus some casual games, but if you're really after something capable of proper gaming we'd recommend upping your budget to £500+ and going for a Core i5 as the bare minimum. We've got some more options on slightly pricier laptop deals here.
At this price you're most likely to find 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, although at the budget end of the market you often find solid-state storage is swapped out for a traditional mechanical hard drive. The upside to this is more storage space; the down side is they are slower, a little noisier and more fragile.
The size of the screen and the overall design of the laptop are going to be purely personal choices. You'll find everything from 11in to 15.6in screens at this price point; a handful with full-HD (1080p) displays but most with HD (720p) screens. Smaller laptops are typically going to be more easily portable, but it's easier to get stuff done on a larger screen, especially if you are wanting to watch video, play casual games or work with spreadsheets.
Don't overlook Chromebooks, with which your children may well be familiar from school. The difference between these and traditional Windows laptops is the software that is installed on them, with Chromebooks instead using Chrome OS. You'll also find CloudBooks, which run Windows 10 S.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Echo Deals for Christmas 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With Amazon's Christmas sale, now live, there are some huge discounts on Echo. Echo Dot 3 is down to a tiny £24.99, while Echo Dot with Clock is now just £34.99. Echo Flex is also reduced at £19.99, plus you'll find excellent value in bundle deals such as the original Ring Doorbell with Echo Dot 3 for just £113.99. 
In this article we've embedded real-time pricing for Echo devices at all the major retailers, and these prices are updated daily so you can be sure they are correct. You can also read on below for where to get refurbished Echos. Plus, we routinely scour the web for the best prices on Echo, and will keep you informed of any hidden gems we find.
Right now Echo purchases also get you 90 days of Amazon Music Unlimited for free, which is two months longer than the existing 30-day trial. Read more about Music Unlimited and how it compares with Prime Music. 
The Echo Dot is Amazon's cheapest smart speaker (the Flex isn't really a speaker - it's more of a utility device). With Alexa built-in it is capable of all the same things as the pricier Echos, but you don't get a display and audio quality is naturally inferior, but still surprisingly good. With a retail price of £49.99, buying an Echo Dot is the best way to try Alexa in your home without investing too much, and it's also the cheapest way to get an Echo in every room of the house when you ultimately decide you love it. Read our full Echo Dot review.
An updated version of Echo Dot comes with a built-in display that can show the time, alarms and timers, as well as the outside temperature - handy additions that enable Echo Dot to work as a bedside alarm clock, though they come at a £10 premium over the standard model. The Echo Dot with Clock retails at £59.99. Read our full review of the Echo Dot with Clock.
The standard Echo has just been updated with the third-gen model, which retails at £89.99 just like its predecessor. (It is still possible to find the Echo 2 at Argos, but unless the price comes down we'd advise buying the newer model.) A step up from Echo Dot, the new Echo offers a refined design and improved audio quality. Plus, Alexa is a constant across all Echo devices: she doesn't change. Note that this Echo does not have a built-in smart home hub or temperature sensor, so look further up the range for that. Read our full Echo review.
Echo Plus (currently in its second-generation) is the device you want if you love the Echo Dot and standard Echo but want to step up audio quality a notch, with a larger 3in woofer and 0.8in tweeter over the standard model's 2.5in woofer and 0.6in tweeter. It also has built-in Zigbee that allows it to act as a hub for all your smart home kit. Naturally it costs a little more, with a retail price of £139.99. Read our full Echo Plus review.
 
The Echo Studio is the top-of-the-line Echo without a display. With a full retail price of £189.99, it's cheaper only than the 10in Echo Show. If you want the ultimate in sound quality, this is the Echo for you, with support for hi-res audio and 3D sound making this a significantly cheaper rival to Apple's HomePod and the Google Home Max. A large slot on the front allows bass from the 5.25in woofer to pour out, and the Studio also has two 2in speakers and a 1in tweeter inside, each positioned to deliver truly room-filling audio. Plus there's a built-in Zigbee hub for controlling compatible smart home kit. Read our Echo Studio review.
 
Sort of a cross between Echo Dot and Echo Show, Echo Spot is a smart alarm clock with Alexa built-in and the smallest (but not cheapest) of Amazon's Echo devices with a screen built-in. It retails at £119.99, which is £40 more than the Echo Show 5 (below), another compact Echo smart display. Read our full Echo Spot review.
The most recent addition to Amazon's Echo line is the Echo Show 5, a smart display that is beaten on price only by the Echo Dot with a retail price of £79.99. Amazon builds in a 5.5in display, which is ideal if you want a screen but also a more compact device than the standard 10in Show. Read our full Echo Show 5 review. Amazon is also offering some great bundles with the Echo Show 5, such as with the Neos SmartCam for a combined £64.99.
 
The second-generation Echo Show is an Alexa smart display with a 10in screen. Retailing at £219.99 it's quite a bit more expensive than anything else in the line, but it also has a usefully large HD screen and packs decent audio with excellent volume and plenty of bass. Read our full Echo Show review.
 
The Echo Input is not strictly an Echo speaker, though it offers a cheap way to turn an existing speaker into an Alexa device, so useful if you don't want to replace your existing kit but you wish it was a bit smarter. It retails at £34.99. Read our full Echo Input review.
 
Following the current Cyber Monday sale we expect to see discounts for Christmas, but the truth is Amazon offers some great deals all year round - especially if you're interested in buying multiple Echos or combining them with other gadgets such as an Amazon Smart Plug, Philips Hue smart bulb or a Ring doorbell.

A great way to save on Echo devices directly from Amazon is through buying refurbished. Refurbished prices can save you up to 54% off the RRP on other Amazon devices too, like Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets.
Certified refurbished devices go through rigorous testing (hence "certified") to ensure products are just like new. You also get a separate 1-year limited warranty. Click here to see all Amazon Certified Refurbished deals.
In the US, there are a lot more options for certified refurbished Amazon devices.
Echo speakers always see big discounts for Christmas, Boxing Day and January sales, Easter sales and Amazon Prime Day. They may also go on sale at other points throughout the year, and we'll alert you to any promotions within this article.
When an Echo device goes on sale at Amazon it is also found at this reduced price at official stockists including Currys, John Lewis and Argos, so be sure to also check these outlets as stocks run low.
You can also find Echo deals from third-party sellers in the US. Newegg, sometimes has bundle deals on Echo devices. See all Echo deals on Newegg here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Survey Launched — You Can Help Shape Ubuntu’s Future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ubuntu turned 15 this year and is still going strong — but what next for the leading desktop Linux distribution? Well, to find out Canonical has launched a brand new user survey.
The Ubuntu 20.04 LTS survey is set to run until January 10, 2020 and hopes to gather feedback from a diverse pool of Linux users.
The responses garnered by the survey will be used to “inform” the future direction of Ubuntu, its roadmap, feature set, and so on.
Heck, it’s even possible that the results could affect the eventual makeup of the upcoming LTS release, due next April.
Rhys Davies, team manger of Robotics at Canonical, explains why the company felt launching a survey was the best avenue for gathering responses.
“Throughout the development process, our teams are in the various forums and threads, listening to your feedback to help inform our decision making,” he writes.
“But in the run-up to something big like an LTS release, is it possible we find ourselves lost in an Ubuntu bubble? Are there developments in open source or trends on a level that we’re just not seeing? And if so, what are they?”
Hence this survey: an antidote to the echo chamber.
Canonical wants to learn what people like about Ubuntu as it is, but also what they don’t like, i.e. the areas the distro falls short on and needs to improve in.
So, to ensure any picture painted is an accurate one, it’s encouraging folks to take the survey regardless of whether they use Ubuntu, have used Ubuntu in the past, or have never though the distro right for their needs.
The survey itself is somewhat long, and spans a wide gamut of questions. There are basic queries like ‘is Ubuntu stable enough?’ and ‘easy to set up?’ though to topics requiring more detail, like ‘what could Ubuntu to do to make your life easier?’ and ‘what do you see as the most major technological growth area in the next 2 years?’.
You can take part in the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS survey using the link below.
Take the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Survey
Once all of the results are in and Canonical has extracted and extrapolated the answered within, they say they will “publish the results for all to see” — just like it did two years ago.
But do keep in mind that the results of the survey will only used to inform development decisions, not dictate them.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We're barely two weeks from Christmas. Those of us looking to get goods delivered in time to put under the tree will need to act very fast. At this time of year, postal and delivery services are working at capacity which can lead to longer than expected delivery times.
With that in mind, here are the delivery and lead times for some of the main shopping sites and retailers around Australia.
As well as running a bunch of sales in the lead up to Christmas, JB HiFi offers "1 Hour Click and Collect" so you can order online and go t a store.
But if that doesn't suit you, there are a number of other options with 2-4 business days for standard deliveries and express service if you want your items in a day or two. They also offer same-day and three-hour delivery if you're prepared to pay extra.
JB HiFi offers Austrlaia Post delivery on some items but that can take 4 - 10 days.
As you'd expect, Amazon is pushing Prime as the best way to leave shipping till the last minute. Items shipped by Amazon AU arrive in as fast as two days after they ship. Prime members also get free domestic delivery, with no minimum order threshold.
In addition, Amazon offers a Priority Delivery service which can get to select Metro areas within one business day. Click here for a free Amazon Prime trial.
As well as having a bunch of Christmas-friendly different discounts, eBay is offering shipping in three days or less for a range of items.
But actual shipping times will vary by vendor so you may need to shop around if the time you want won't arrive in time.
Big W offers Next Day Delivery which allows you to have your order express delivered by Australia Post the next business day from the date of your order if you live in metro areas (excluding ACT & NT):
Its standard delivery arrangements of between four and eight days deepening on whether you're in metropolitan, regional or remote areas. The further you are from the metro areas, the more shipping costs. You can find more delivery options here.
Kmart use a variety of different delivery partners depending on the size of the time and destination.
Kmart's delivery arrangements very from two to 14 days depending how far from the metro area you are. Even in metro areas, it can take up to four business days for your delivery to be confirmed via email, let alone delivered. In other words, Click & Collect looks to be a better option.
As well as offering click and collect, EB Games shipping times are currently sitting at a week so you'll need to get orders in this week to receive your packages before Christmas.
Book depository is suggesting the following final order dates to get your books before Christmas:
Click here to see more.
Standard delivery from Catch will take 2-5 business days to ship to metro areas, 2-7 business days for regional and 3-10 business days for rural/remote. If you're ordering from one of there third-parties in its market, then those orders may need more time, so be sure to check the estimated delivery date before completing your order.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Govts agree on national API standards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Commonwealth, state and territory IT ministers have agreed to a set of national application programming interface (API) design standards to promote interoperability between IT systems.
The decision, taken at the fifth meeting of the Australian Digital and Data Council in Sydney on Friday, aims to ensure APIs are consistent between all levels of government.
The standards will allow governments, as well as “trusted” third-parties, to “securely share, re-use and enhance data in real-time”.
“The national API design standards create a common method of API development that all governments can adopt,” the ministers said in a communique following the meeting.
“This will create consistency between governments and promote interoperability between jurisdictions’ IT systems.
“Governments across Australia will be able to develop services more efficiently, learning from each other and, where needed, have services that work well across jurisdictions.”
Ministers approved the creation of the standards at an April 2019 meeting of the council and tasked the Digital Transformation Agency with prioritising their development.
The standards were to build on the API standards work of other jurisdictions to date, particularly Victoria which has had a whole-of-government API portal since April.
The DTA first identified the need for interoperability standards, including those for APIs, in December 2018 as part of its digital services platform strategy to enable like up new and existing systems.
The national API design standards (NAPIDS), which have been developed using a co-design model led by the DTA and the Victorian government, are intended to be used to as best practices guides when developers are building APIs.
“The NAPIDS enable developers building APIs to move past common decision points by referencing pre-agreed, best practice design patterns and implementing their APIs according to these standards,” the government’s api.gov.au hub states.
The standards separate APIs into three categories: system level APIs, process level APIs and experience level APIs, each of which has differing requirements.
Experience level APIs or “APIs intended to ease the adoption of API integration between and organisation and its external consumers”, for instance, requires that the design standards be applied.
The standards also replace the DTA's plan for a data exchange platform, which CEO Randal Brugeaud has previously said was dumped after the discovery process "determined that a discrete data exchange was not the best way to do it".
A bare-bones version of the government’s API catalogue is similarly contained on api.gov.au, with five APIs, including from the ATO and Australian Bureau of Statistics, listed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Macquarie Uni races tech giants to build AI medical scribe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A team from Macquarie University has set out to build its own version of an artificial intelligence-powered scribe in a race against global tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
Researchers from the Australian Institute of Health Innovation (AIHI) at Macquarie are currently hunting for data to build an automated speech-to-text capability that can accurately record medical jargon for integration with health records.
While AI scribes have become much more popular and powerful in recent times, they’re still far from perfect (often with hilarious or frustrating results).
And although AIHI didn't delve too deep into it, the security of consultation recordings could be a major concern for doctors and patients alike, especially when processed by large multinationals known for harvesting data to sell to unknown third parties.
In a paper recently published in the journal Digital Medicine, the researchers said that apart from the sensitivity of the data, there are five main challenges in producing an effective scribe.
One of the main problems is that AI technology needs a lot of data on which it can be trained, which is “extremely hard to come by,” Dr Juan Quiroz, one of the researchers working on the project, told Macquarie’s Lighthouse publication.
“We need recordings of tens of thousands of conversations between patients and doctors so the AI can learn patterns from the data.
“Doctors and clinicians rarely record their consultations,” he said, noting that asking them to do so is yet another imposition for professionals already operating with a late on their plate.
Even if a clinician does record a consultation, many AIs struggle to transcribe recordings with multiple voices, accents or ambient noise.
Training the AIs is no easy task either due to the unstructured nature of many patient consultations and taking down notes to compare human and AI outcomes takes a great deal of time and clinical expertise.
“The currently closed environment for sharing sensitive data means that the few research teams with access to data are the only ones that can make advances, further slowing progress by impeding open science,” the researchers said.
Nevertheless, a localised AI transcriber could prove incredibly useful at mitigating the current adverse effects of clinical documentation, which has been associated with clinician burnout, information loss, distractions during consultation and increased cognitive load.

The agency order prohibits Cambridge Analytica from misrepresenting the extent to which it protects the privacy and confidentiality of personal information.
It also stops the consulting firm from participating in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework and other similar regulatory organisations.
The impact of the agency order is not immediately clear as the consulting firm is no longer in business.
The order comes after Facebook agreed in July to pay a record-breaking US$5 billion fine to the FTC, in order to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices.
The government agency continues to pursue a separate antitrust investigation of the company.
The FTC's probe into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica was triggered by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with Cambridge Analytica.
The consultancy’s clients included President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign.
The FTC voted 5-0 to issue the opinion and final order against Cambridge Analytica.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Is USB4 And Do You Need It?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">USB is still one of the most important pieces of technology in the 21st century. They charge your devices, they carry around your folders filled with files you hardly use or look at, and they help to transfer things between devices. But a new USB type is on its way and its going to change everything up. Here's what the USB4 is all about.
The USB4, first announced in March 2019, is marked down as the next generation of USB. Until now, USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and the current model, 3.2, have all been released with features expanding and improving upon the previous generation. This has meant faster upload and download transferring speeds, increased capacities and the ability to transfer files simultaneously. The USB4, however, will turn the humble USB into even more of a powerhouse.
In September 2019, the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) announced USB4's specifications giving us a better idea of what to expect. They would now be able to:
Firstly, speed. The USB4 will come with two speed lanes ⁠— 40Gps and 20Gps. That's already huge upgrade on the USB 3.2, which maxes out at 2.5Gps. That's a momentous amount of data flowing through your trust USB steed within a matter of seconds. Most importantly, it's far faster than internet speeds so while the cloud has been able to make possible the transfer of large files remotely, the USB4 will be incredibly useful when physical delivery of large files will suffice.
Aside from impressive transfer speeds, the USB4 will also be backwards compatible through the use of adapters. While it's compatible with USB 2.0 and higher (if you still use USB 1.0, it's time to upgrade), you probably won't get those mega speeds if you're using legacy cables and ports. Still, it's good to know our older tech won't become completely antiquated once USB4 rolls in. As the USB4 is based on Intel's Thunderbolt 3 specifications, it'll also support most Thunderbolt 3 cables. It's important to understand that Thunderbolt 3 compatibility isn't mandatory on all USB4s once production begins so it's always best to triple check in case your shiny new USB4 compatible laptop or tablet comes without it.
USB4 also promises to be a literal powerhouse. It'll come fitted with USB Power Delivery (USB PD) technology so you can charge your phones and devices through it with up to 100 watts of power. Given so many of us need to power up devices on the go with our laptops or through powerpoints, this will be a welcome improvement.
While it was first expected to be released in late 2019, that prediction is extremely unlikely at this stage. The specification announcement back in September provided no real clues but it's expected the USB4 will start rolling out from mid-2020 after the USB-IF's Compliance Workshop in February 2020.
I mean, laptops are already being fitted with USB4 ports so it can't reasonably be more than a year away. Surely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Break Out Of Apple's Walled Garden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has always been good at keeping people within its own little bubble. The company has strived for an insular ecosystem which can certainly make it tricky for those on the inside looking to break out. But it's by no means impossible.
If you're ready to venture out of the Apple bubble into the wider world of tech, here's how you can do it.
While hardware was once a major reason for jumping over to another brand, the points of difference between physical smartphones these days are pretty minimal. In other words, you're probably reading this because you're tired of iOS, have concerns over Apple's use of data, or simply want the freedom that comes with an Android, Windows, or Linux operating system, rather than switching it up for different hardware.
That being said, there are plenty of non-iOS alternatives to the apps and services available to Apple users, and making the switch over to most of them is fairly straight-forward.
One of the biggest services you'll probably want to cut ties with is iCloud, but luckily, Google Drive is waiting for you with open arms. In fact, it'll even help you transfer a bunch of your data from your iPhone to your new device. Download the app onto your iPhone and sync your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars, then follow these instructions for getting that data onto a new Android phone.
For iMessage, there are a ton of great universal alternatives that you're probably already using, so there shouldn't be any issues for you there. Facebook Messenger is a good start and can even be used as a standalone app, so you can still avoid Facebook proper if that's something you're keen on. If data privacy is important to you, apps like Signal or Wickr will ensure your messages are encrypted. WhatsApp is also another good alternative to iMessage.
When it comes to transferring data from a Mac computer to a PC, things are a little easier – a standard portable hard drive should do the trick. It's worth noting, however, that Apple-specific apps and the files that rely on them won't be able to be used, but chances are there's a good alternative in place.
Some software and services don't even need to be replaced completely, like Apple Music for example, which will work perfectly fine on Windows or Android, but if you plan on ditching Apple completely, Spotify is just as good, if not better for music streaming.
If you like using GarageBand for making or recording music, there are heaps of excellent PC equivalents, whether it's premium software packages like Cubase or Ableton, or free alternatives like Reaper. Movie Maker 10 is a good free replacement for Apple's iMovie if that's something you used for home movies.
In terms of password management, you can easily swap out the iCloud Keychain for a third-party app like 1Password or LastPass. For everything else, a quick Google search should put you on the right path for a suitable Windows/Android replacement.
Of course, you can't ditch the Apple ecosystem while you're running Apple hardware, so think about what operating system you'd like to go with and look into some hardware options. The most common alternative is Android for smartphones and Windows for laptops/desktop PCs, so that's generally a pretty good place to start.
Smartphones have a ton of options, with the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel ranges coming in as the top iPhone contenders. Samsung's phones provide good all-rounder alternatives, while the Pixel is a good bet if you wanna lean into Google's ecosystem a little harder. Outside of those, there are a bunch of other options, such as Huawei, Oppo, and Nokia smartphones.
While Apple was once on top with regards to laptop design, most brands now offer a sleek, slim model with just as much power and portability. Some will even offer far more than just a standard computer. For example, 2-in-1s such as the HP Spectre x360 (pictured above) fold all the way around to become a tablet with touchscreen functionality.
The good thing about making this transition is that you don't have to buy everything in one hit. In fact, there's nothing stopping you from running an iPhone and a Windows PC simultaneously because fortunately, Apple plays nice with a lot of its essential software.
Even if you do have to connect an iPhone to a PC – which is pretty rare these days given the variety of wireless setup options available – you can still easily install and run iTunes on Windows.
In other words, don't feel like you need to run out and buy a whole new suite of personal tech just to rip yourself out of Apple's ecosystem. Go with one device at a time, get a feel for it, and then size-up something else. This approach will also save you from outlaying a large sum of money in one hit, which means you can spend a little more on each item as you go to ensure you're getting quality devices.
Either way, it pays to do your research before jumping into something headfirst.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Husqvarna Svartpilen 200 revealed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Svartpilen 200 is based on the KTM 200 Duke and gets the same 26hp, 200cc, single-cylinder engine.
Husqvarna has just entered the Indian market with the Svartpilen 250 and the Vitpilen 250. These two KTM 250 Duke-based models are set to be the company’s first offerings in India once they hit the market in February 2020. However, it looks like Husqvarna won’t be stopping there as their global website was recently updated with a new model – the Svartpilen 200.
Like the 250s, the Svartpilen 200 is based on a KTM as well. It uses the same 200cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected liquid-cooled motor that makes 26hp. Mated to this DOHC engine is a 6-speed gearbox. Other mechanicals like the suspension and brakes remain similar too. Moreover, the Svartpilen 200 also uses the same alloy wheels as the Svartpilen 250 and not wire-spoke wheels like the 401. Other components like the body panels and LED lighting are identical to that of the Svartpilen 250. However, the 200 runs an underslung exhaust and not the side-mounted one like the 250.
Husqvarna could launch the Svartpilen 200 in India sometime next year as a more affordable version of the 250. We have seen KTM do this with the 200 Duke and 250 Duke. What remains to be seen is how they will be priced. We can expect the Husqvarna Svartpilen 200 to cost around Rs 10,000-15,000 more than the KTM 200 Duke, which sells for Rs 1.62 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).

    <h5 class="mb-1">New 1.0 turbo-petrol engine to power Renault Triber, upcoming HBC SUV</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Renault-Nissan HR10 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine will sell alongside the existing BR10 unit.
The Renault Triber has got off to a good start in India with sales crossing 18,500 units since its launch on August 28, 2019. The Triber’s flexible interior that offers seating for seven, and keen pricing have seemingly found favour with buyers. At the Triber's unveil in July, we had reported that Renault was working on a more powerful turbo-petrol version of the sub-four-metre 7-seater. We can now confirm fresh details of the much-awaited, turbo-petrol engine that will make its debut in India sometime in 2020.
Powering the Triber turbo, as well the upcoming HBC compact SUV, will be an all-new Renault-Nissan-developed, 1.0-litre, three-cylinder, turbo-petrol engine that carries the code ‘HR10’. Essentially a three-cylinder version of the four-pot HR13, 1.3-litre turbo-petrol unit, the engine will power a range of Renault and Nissan products in India from 2020. While the official power figures have not yet been released, insiders involved with the project say the engine will make close to 95hp. The three-cylinder engine is also said to be fairly sophisticated with dual variable valve timing and an exhaust manifold partially integrated into the cylinder head.
The new turbo engine will be sold alongside the existing 72hp and 96Nm, 1.0-litre naturally-aspirated petrol engine (code: BR10) that will receive an update before the BS6 emission norms kick in.
Renault is also working on an AMT auto option for the Triber, though it remains to be seen if the transmission will be offered on the turbocharged versions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp stops working on millions of old phones this month - see if yours is on the list</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WhatsApp users be warned, the popular smartphone app could stop working on your mobile soon as the chat app looks to streamline its service in 2020.
As is customary for many phone apps, the Facebook-owned WhatsApp app is also preparing to cull a wide range of older model phones who it will no longer support moving forward.
A Whats-App support page has confirmed that it will stop supporting certain devices on December 31, 2019. That being said the iOS and Android blocks for certain devices won’t happen in full until closer to February 1, 2020.
So you should still be able to send that all-important "Happy New Year" message on New Years Day, but as WhatsApp warns, "some features may stop functioning at any time."
As such, the only solution faced by smartphone users impacted will be to simply upgrade their handset if they wish to continue using the service. beyond the 2020 dates mentioned.
There's a widespread of phones impacted by the announcement, but the users who will most likely be impacted are those with an iPhone running software older than iOS 7.
That means that those with an iPhone 5S and 5C are most likely to be impacted from an Apple standpoint.
Likewise, any Android device which is still running version 2.3.7 will also find themselves impacted, with Windows Phone users the worst hit, as access will completely stop on December 31, 2019
A full list of smartphones that will no longer be supported can be found just below, as per an update posted to the WhatsApp support page recently.
Smartphones that will soon stop supporting WhatsApp include:
• Nokia Symbian S60 after June 30, 2017
• BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 after December 31, 2017
• Nokia S40 after December 31, 2018
• All Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019
• Android versions 2.3.7 and older after February 1, 2020
• iPhone iOS 7 and older after February 1, 2020
WhatsApp says that anyone using these older phones can no longer create new accounts or reverify existing accounts.
‘Because we no longer actively develop for these operating systems, some features might stop functioning at any time,’ the company said in a blog post announcing the cut-off dates.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tata Altroz review, test drive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tata Motors forays into the premium hatchback segment with the Altroz. Does it have the right ingredients?
You first saw it as the 45X concept at Auto Expo 2018, and then later in near-production form at Geneva 2019. What you see here is the final version of the Tata Altroz that will finally go on sale in early 2020. In a nutshell, the Altroz is Tata Motors' answer to the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Hyundai i20 and Honda Jazz. Like the premium hatchbacks it goes up against, the Tata Altroz measures just a litte under 4m (3,990mm to be precise) to qualify as a 'small car' and yet promises big car levels of space, refinement and comfort.
The Altroz is not only big in size as far as hatchbacks go but it's also a big deal in Tata's journey as a carmaker. That's because this is the first model to be built on the Tata's all-new ALFA (for Agile, Light, Flexible, Advanced) architecture. Along with OMEGA arc (that underpins the Harrier), the ALFA arc will form the basis of a slew of new Tatas in the time to come. The modular architecture can support a whole range of body styles ranging from 3.7m to 4.3m in length, and has been developed with electrification in mind. Doors that open 90 degrees and a flat rear floor are some of the features that will be common to cars, SUVs and MPVs built on ALFA arc.
The Altroz also happens to be the first Tata to get BS6-compliant engines. On offer are 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol and 1.5-litre turbo-diesel engines, each allied to manual gearboxes. A petrol-automatic with a dual-clutch transmission is in the works, and there's also a more powerful 1.2-litre turbo-petrol that will join the line-up in due time. For now, we've got our hands on the versions that will be available at launch, and there's lots to talk about.
Tata Motors has been on a hot streak as far as exterior design goes and, to our eyes at least, the Altroz takes the story forward with pizzazz. Sure, the silhouette is conventional hatchback but the multiple stylistic flourishes on the body work cohesively to elevate the overall look of the car.
The shark nose-like front end, the sleek grille finished in black, and the large and swept-back headlights that are lined by a band of chrome give the Altroz its distinctive face. Some might see the arrangement as a modern interpretation of the original Indica's 'smiling grille', but Tata designers certainly didn't mention that as an inspiration. High-set fog lamps (also home to the LED DRLs) and an elegant air dam on the bumper are other elements of interest up front.
You'll witness a clever play of colours at the Altroz's sides. The upswept windows come underlined by a black embellishment that starts thick at the front and tapers towards the rear, in effect, giving the illusion of a car with a sporty tipped-forward stance; a bit Lamborghini Diablo meets mass-market hatchback.
The large wheel arches lend the Altroz suitable volume too, but even the sleek 16-inch 'laser-cut' alloys don't look quite big enough. What is sure to be a bit polarising is the placement of the rear door handles; they sit on the C-pillar rather than in the conventional position on the doors.
Tata's designers have also gone for a dual-tone theme for the Altroz's edgy tail end. The spoiler, tail-light surround and upper portion of the bootlid come finished in black, and look quite sporty. Buyers also have the option of a black roof for the full effect.
In all, the Altroz has a 'concept car for the road' look about it, and that's a great starting point.
Each of the Altroz's four doors open to 90 degrees, and getting in to the front section of the cabin is particularly easy. First impressions once inside are largely positive too. Sure, the dashboard design is not quite as cutting edge as the exterior, but you'll like what you see. The Altroz's free-standing 7.0-inch touchscreen is positioned high up (and hence in clear sight), and what adds some flavour here is the layered effect of the dash with textured plastics for the top, a gloss finish for the centre and light grey materials lower down. Turquoise backlighting (adjustable for intensity) for the raised centre console brings in some vibrancy at night too. Material quality is good by class standards but there are places where the panel gaps aren't consistent, like the surrounds for the glovebox. What you will like, however, is the reassuring thunk on door shut.
 
Large seats means comfort up front is well taken care of, a sliding centre armrest on top-spec cars is a welcome inclusion, while the flat-bottomed and leather-wrapped steering feels great to hold. Frontal visibility is good too but the Altroz's thick A-pillars do create blindspots, especially on the near side. What also takes some getting used to is the instrumentation. There's a class-first combo of an analogue speedometer and digital tachometer but the squared-out dials aren't easy enough to follow. The tacho's triangulated needle end also highlights an engine speed range rather than a specific rpm, in case this is something you keep an eye on. The Altroz's 7.0-inch digital screen also the informative multi-info display, and what's nice is that navigation instructions from a connected smartphone are relayed here, reducing the need to look away at the main touchscreen.
 
Connecting a smartphone won't be a bother either (unlike on the Harrier) with the USB slot positioned in plain sight at the base of the centre console. The Altroz cabin does score well on space for small items too. Compartments within the large 15-litre cooled glovebox make it easy to stow your tablet safely and there are cupholders on the glovebox lid too should you want to have an impromptu picnic. There's another pair of cupholders near the gear lever, a sizeable storage bay under the driver's armrest and a 1-litre bottleholder, and even an umbrella holder on each of the front doors. Storage at the back includes large door pockets with shelves to keep your phones, and map pockets on the front seat back rests.
Getting onto the Altroz back seat is not as comfy as it's made out to be. Yes, the doors open wide but the aperture between the seat and B-pillar isn't the largest. A relatively high-set rear seat does help here, and this also means you get a fairly good view out the windows. The rear section of the Altroz cabin doesn't feel as airy as a Jazz's and doesn't offer the same legroom that you'd get in a Baleno; but you really won't have reason to complain on either count. There's enough knee room for six footers to sit in comfort, and it's only if you sit bolt upright will you find headroom adequate but no more. The Altroz is the widest car in the class and there is enough shoulder room to host three occupants at the back. What also makes life easier for the middle passenger is the flat floor, which, as mentioned, will be a trait on all ALFA architecture Tata cars. The rear seat works well as a place for two with the fold-down rear armrest positioned at just the right height. What does take away from the comfort to an extent is the excessive bolstering in the lumbar region; you'll find yourself changing position often. A nice inclusion here is a dedicated 12V charging socket.
 
The Tata Altroz gets a 345-litre boot which is marginally more than the Baleno's 339 litres and a bit less than the Jazz's 354 litres. The high loading lip can make it difficult to load heavy luggage but the well-shaped boot means you can fit in plenty of stuff. The rear seat backrest doesn't split but it can be folded forward to enhance luggage space to 665 litres. While luggage space is generous, we wonder if it’s come at the expense of fuel tank capacity, which is a meagre 37 litres. So to get a decent range, good fuel efficiency will be crucial.
 
The Altroz will be available in four trims, and the range starts with the XE that gets the safety basics such as ABS with EBD, dual airbags, reverse parking sensor and central locking. Drive modes and manual air-conditioning are also part of the package. The XM-spec Altroz adds in power windows, a 3.5-inch infotainment system from Harman, power-adjust and folding mirrors and ambient lighting at the footwell. The XT trim adds in more goodies by way of a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, 7.0-inch digital MID screen, LED DRLs, push- button start, a reverse camera, cruise control and start-stop tech on the petrols. Range-topping Altroz XZ versions go the distance with 16-inch laser-cut alloy wheels, projector headlamps, auto climate control, auto lights, rain-sensing wipers, ambient lighting, and front and rear armrests. A contrast roof is a paid option on the XZ cars.
 
Uniquely, each of the trims is also offered with an add-on pack that bundles in specific features. The Rhythm pack gives Altroz XE and XM buyers the option to upgrade to the infotainment systems from a trim higher. On the other hand, the Style pack brings in a contrast roof, stylised steel wheel and LED DRLs to the XM. XT buyers have the option of the Luxe pack, where you get a leather-wrapped steering wheel, height-adjustable driver's seat and rear centre armrest. XZ buyers can also spruce up the look of their cars with the Urban pack that includes diamond-cut alloy wheels, exterior colour-coordinated detailing in the cabin and a contrast black roof. Tata Motors says it will introduce more packs and options to the Altroz in the future.
Where the Altroz does lag behind the curve is in connectivity. There's no eSIM-based connected tech (it's in the pipeline though), and even the 7.0-inch screen doesn't work as slick as you'd like. The Harman sound system does deliver fair sound quality though.
There's much to like about the way the Altroz drives. The new platform shines immediately with a great ride and handling balance. There is a hint of firmness to the ride but the suspension still manages to absorb the rough stuff at low speeds with ease. You feel well cushioned the faster you go and the big highlight is high-speed stability. The Altroz feels comfortable and sure-footed at triple-digit speeds, and, correspondingly, works really well as a long-distance machine. There's a confidence in the way the Altroz changes direction too. Turn-in is slick (better so on the heavier diesel) and there's a lovely feeling of connect at the steering. The electric steering is light when you need it to be at low speeds, but weights up effectively as you add on speed. There is some road noise that creeps in but, on first instance, the ALFA architecture underpinning the Altroz sure comes across as promising.
Where the Altroz seems to be bit of a work in progress is when talking of the petrol engine. The Altroz's petrol engine is essentially an updated version of the Tigor's 1.2-litre, three-cylinder unit. There's dual variable valve timing and the compression ratio has also been bumped up. Resultantly, power is up to 86hp while max torque is 113Nm. The figures are par for the course for this class of car but overall performance does leave you wanting. Part throttle responses are pleasant and the engine is earnest at low speeds but that pep you get in a Baleno is simply missing, even in the more powerful City mode. But then again, the Baleno weighs 146kg less than the Altroz petrol that tips the scales at 1,036kg - about as much as the i20 and Jazz.
A light clutch makes the Altroz easy to live with in town, but again, the 5-speed gearbox isn't the slickest in the business. Quickshifts aren't it's thing. The 1.2 engine doesn't have much to give at the top end and revving the engine only draws your attention to the thrum from the three-cylinder engine. Auto start-stop also has the petrol engine come to life with a bit of a judder.
In a sense, it's the diesel Altroz that feels like the more complete package. The 1.5-litre, four-cylinder diesel is from the Nexon albeit in a lower 90hp and 200Nm state of tune. The power downgrade was primarily to make the engine compatible with the 5-speed gearbox's lower torque rating. But not that you'd feel any lack of power. The diesel engine can feel a bit hesitant in on-off throttle driving, typical of our towns, but it's quick to settle into a rhythm too. The build up of power is linear from low down in the rev range, and there's a mild step up closer to 1,800rpm. You'll like the easy access to power and the comfort with which the 1,150kg Altroz diesel gets to cruising speeds. Again, this isn't an engine to wind hard; keep it in it's comfort zone and you'll manage to rake up the kilometres without much fuss. If anything, the engine does become gravelly beyond 3,000rpm and it isn't quite in Hyundai diesel territory when talking refinement. Interestingly enough, and a point worth highlighting is that the diesel test cars were running on BS6 grade diesel brought in from Delhi.
Of the other things, the diesel Altroz's clutch action is light enough but the 5-speed gearbox feels its best with gentle inputs.
The Tata Altroz makes an immediate impression for the way it looks. It's got a show value that no other car in this class can match. And that counts for a lot today. The Altroz makes for a practical family car too with a cabin that offers enough by way of space and comfort. As an added plus, it is also good to drive with arguably the best dynamics among premium hatchbacks. And buyers who cover large distances will also find a great match in the well-rounded Altroz diesel.
A peppier petrol engine, better refinement and a greater focus on connectivity are things on our wish list, and elements that would make the Altroz easier to recommend. What's a also a question mark for now is fuel economy. All said, the Tata Altroz has some solid positives and has the potential to make its place in the premium hatchback segment. All that's left is for Tata to price it well. With a price tag between Rs 5-8 lakh (estimated, ex-showroom), the Altroz could just upset the apple cart.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China to Lead World in 5G Scale: Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maui (US): China will lead the world in the 5G scale and Qualcomm expects to increase business with China in the 5G transition, Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon has said.
“China is likely going to have the largest 5G rollout and network,” Amon said on the sidelines of Qualcomm’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit held this week in Maui, Hawaii.
“The scale in China’s deployment plans makes 5G ubiquitous with nationwide coverage as fast as possible.
“In terms of taking the importance of 5G as the future of Internet, I think China is doing the right thing with an accelerated rollout of this technology,” Amon said, Xinhua news agency has reported.
In June, China granted commercial-use 5G licenses to the country’s top three telecom operators — China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom — as well as China Broadcasting Network. Many Chinese tech companies unveiled their 5G smartphones.
According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, 5G technology is expected to create more than 8 million jobs by 2030.
“I believe China understood since the very beginning that 5G will be the essential infrastructure to connect to the Internet. And the numbers that the three operators had made public are incredible,” Amon said.
“If Chinese operators execute their plans, we will see 1 million 5G base stations by the end of 2020. And that is going to build the infrastructure that will not only connect billions of smartphones, but will also multiple billions of other smart devices and industries that will benefit from 5G,” he said.
In his opinion, China regards 5G as fundamental infrastructure for the society, which gives the country the advantage on the scale and the commitment to its deployment.
5G touches many industries, not only cellphones, but also smart cities, automobiles, healthcare and other sectors. It is now being understood by governments worldwide that 5G is very important and no country will benefit from being late to 5G, Amon said.
Unlike the deployment of 3G and 4G networks when China was behind other key markets, the country is now in the forefront of 5G transition with other leading economies, Amon said.
“I believe that is a sign of the maturity of the Chinese economy today,” he noted.
Optimistic about the progress of the Chinese mobile ecosystem, Amon noted that it is very consistent with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
“As the mobile ecosystem follows the relationship and the expansion of the Chinese economy through all those different countries, it is likely to be very competitive in the transition to 5G,” Amon said.
He cited the examples of Chinese tech companies such as Xiaomi, OPPO and OnePlus. Phones of Xiaomi are now in the portfolio of virtually every operator in Europe, while OnePlus is growing in the US, which is traditionally a very difficult market.
“We have now two vibrant companies of China’s ecosystem in the US market, one is OnePlus and the other one is Motorola-Lenovo, with the new Razor being a great innovation in the market,” he said.
China’s mobile ecosystem will take the opportunity of the 5G transition to grow outside the country and establish a very strong position in the markets such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, Eastern and Western Europe and the US, Amon said.
Saying that he is “super excited” about Qualcomm’s business in China, Amon applauded the win-win cooperation between Qualcomm and its Chinese partners, such as Xiaomi, OPPO, OnePlus, Vivo and Motorola.
Amon called the cooperation an example of successful relationship between the two countries, adding that it allows Chinese partners to not only grow in domestic consumption, but also expand outside China with the BRI.
“We are not backing down on our China cooperation. We’re increasing our cooperation in resources towards or partnerships in China in the 5G transition,” he said.
According to Amon, despite the current China-US trade frictions, Qualcomm’s business with China is increasing, rather than decreasing. “I expect that to continue in 2020 and 2021 as we go to this 5G transition,” he said.
At the summit, Qualcomm unveiled two new 5G Snapdragon mobile platforms — Snapdragon 865 and 765/765G. It also announced the world’s first 5G-supported extended reality platform, modular 5G mobile platforms and new 3D sonic fingerprint technology.
Defining the role of Qualcomm as an enabler of mobile ecosystem and partnerships, Amon said that 5G has unlocked an era of the “Invention Age.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">“You’ve Got to Have Courage!” BP on Going “All-In” on the Cloud</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An “all in” BP cloud migration will see the energy supermajor shut down its two mammoth Canary Wharf data centres in favour of shifting 900+ mission critical applications to Amazon Web Services (AWS)’s infrastructure.
The project is no lift-and-shift of a few customer-facing apps.
The software being moved to the cloud from January 2020 will include real-time oil and gas trading applications handling billions of pounds of transactions and running on custom hardware (“thankfully, no mainframes!” says BP’s Stewart Fry – the man in charge – wryly).
It will include SAP software handling HR and finance functions for a 17,500-strong global workforce; databases capturing metrics on everything from European spark spreads to upstream oil production in Angola.
What drove BP to make this move, after having taken a “dual-cloud” approach using both AWS and Azure in the US? And how did the project team build a business case?
Computer Business Review joined Stewart Fry, BP’s global VP for enterprise IT and security at Re:Invent in Las Vegas, for a refreshingly frank conversation about the motivations for and challenges of the shift.
Anticipating what it will cost to run nearly 1,000 applications in the cloud instead of on-premises is no mean feat, irrespective of the oil and gas industry’s notoriously robust ability to to crunch the numbers of high CAPEX, long life-cycle projects.
Stewart admits that early on some guesswork was involved – and keeping executives informed with rolling updates as the project evolved was crucial: “We did our first data centre exit in 2016, we’re just finishing that (our Houston data centre).
“When did the original economics, it really was based on like-for-like IaaS comparison between what it would cost you to run your on-premise data centre – you do the OpEx, the people, the power – mapping that to what you think that would cost you in the cloud. And of course, it isn’t easy: it was tight! (Laughs).
“But we knew if we just picked up the existing on-premise environment and put it on the cloud it would be more expensive and there was a bunch of things that we knew we couldn’t hope to guess. So with leadership internally we developed a rolling plan: ‘this is how we’ll start with…’, and kept checking in to report what we were learning. And out of our US data centre, we’ve rationalised 30 percent of our applications.
“We guessed that into our business case and [made it happen] by forcing it through. We’d tried rationalisation programmes before and this was the most effective…”
“Just small things that hung around, doing internal processing work… they may not of cost anything but just consumed a virtual slice somewhere, and held data that was all locked down for a small transactional bit of one [BP] unit.
“When we’ve moved to the cloud, we’ve looked at groupings of those [semi-dormant or highly siloed applications]together and standardised on single applications, or brought datasets together.
“What’s really interesting is that 70 percent of our workloads on the cloud now aren’t what we migrated. They’re new things. The enablement of the move has opened people’s minds to the art of the possible. Because how could you have hoped, in 2016, to know Kinesis [Ed: An AWS data streaming service] and all these other new cloud feastures was coming along and what you could do with that?
“Ultimately though, if you’ve got a base case that looks pretty good, all the rest is extra value. The rolling plan we’ve had with the executive has really helped us.”
“A massive one. On-premises, we used to buy services from vendors with a lot of application maintenance: we were one of the most outsourced [companies] you could be.
“Our partners didn’t do anything wrong: we’d asked them to do it, but databases were sort of managed with the applications. As we move to the cloud, we’ve moved to database as a service and so we’ve sought to standardise our offerings around things like RDS [Amazon Relational Database Service].
“What this has allowed us to do is to pull workloads  together, provision the right fit-for-purpose capabilities for the demand workloads. And the other interesting thing is that all of our partners were managing the databases slightly differently.
“Wherever, wherever we can, we want to go to open source. Clearly, like for many others, we have to use Microsoft, we use Oracle, we use Hana for SAP…
But we’ve been able to get our own management of the databases far more in control.”
Some of our most complex applications are Europe, and that’s going to be critical to our migration path. Just due to the types of technology that they have been running on; proprietary hardware that is not transferable in its current state to an AWS landing zone…
We have two major European data centres in Canary Wharf, and a secondary centre in Watford. That covers Europe and actually pulls in some non-European workloads; we do some work for Angola and services the a whole bunch of the Middle East and Africa.
“We’ve got a whole floor of a [co-located] global switch environment: but we owned all of the equipment; all the infrastructure… it’s a heavy, capital-intensive world and when we decided not to be hybrid it was a relief.
In the US we’re close to shutting off our first data centre now and the ‘big rock’s are always at the end, as we call them, the most complex big things that we’re trying to innovate on. But AWS love a problem: they’ve got really smart engineers, we’ve got really smart engineers and they’re working together to solve some of the problems that no one else has and you can navigate through that.
In the US, we’re one of the top three traders in the world of oil and gas and we’ve successfully moved all of our trading applications out of Houston onto AWS. We’ve moved over 2000 applications already.
And I meet a lot of vendors who tell me they’ve got a silver bullet for fixing my migration problems. But we’ve got great partners who work with us. We know we don’t have all the answers. But with the right partners and our own teams will we’ll find a way through the solutions.
“You have to have courage. The energy industry has changed many times over the past 100 years. We fix big, complex problems. We don’t shy away from it. That’s been that’s our culture as an engineering company or as a technology company.
“When we declared our cloud-first strategy in 2016, CloudReach really helped us, supplement our engineering teams and build out our regions, with our technical design patterns; and billing.
“(Our businesses tell me all the time they don’t want an allocation of a share of a box. They want to pay for what they consume: they’re happy to pay more if they consume more, but they want to pay less if they consume less. Getting billing right has been crucial for everyone…)
“The other two vendors we’ve worked with a lot are Wipro and Veeam; Accenture have also helped on the SAP environments.
“We’ve been building and growing talent internally though a lot.
“AWS have really worked with us on training, so we have programmes from the very basic to ‘cloud ninja’. We’ve also had to really retrain our management teams so that they think differently about managing the products they’re responsible for.
“We operate everything in BP as a service. We’ve put everything into a service team, and there are squads within that. These squads are nearly always a blend of BP and partners. We’re moving away from what was a traditional application maintenance agreement, which has somewhat run its course, to partners joining our squads.
“In that way, we may buy partners in as an FTE, as a sprint, as an outcome we’ve defined. But partners have to be part of our squads.
When we first built our cloud environments [in the US], we basically stretched our VPN out around them. We had a big central hub… we set strict rules.
“We were learning and didn’t want anarchy to reign, so we said ‘these are the security rules, these are the builds you can have; if you want new features, we’ll put it into our central teams and they’ll release them’. Of course, the team could never keep up with AWS nor our own application teams’ demands of what they wanted.
What we’re moving to now is a hub and spoke model where the security and the access sit out on the spokes.
We have a few core rules that we know matter: security, types of build, billing approach, some break-class capabilities for patching. (Applications [team] needs to decide but if they haven’t done it in a certain time we break the glass and do it).
But now the ‘spokes’ are able to innovate at pace, as they are not constrained by a central hub; they can accelerate away. I wouldn’t move away from the journey we’ve been on as we’ve learned it was constraining, and we needed to change it, although some teams still want and get an internal managed service.
A lot of our upstream activity is on Azure.
We’ve just found it a natural better fit in terms of the partnerships we’ve formed. Then again, Shell have put their’s [upstream applications] on AWS…
“Having a dual-cloud strategy works for us. If you’re doing a lot of engineering upwards, we find AWS great; for a lot of the ready-made platforms we find Azure good for that. And it boils down to how partnerships are forming.
In Europe we’ve come to a fantastic solution.
We had to test ourselves on why we didn’t go with a dual-cloud strategy, but we pulled together something unique.
Partnerships are changing: everybody has got to lean in to the fact that the world is changing and test boundaries… the days of just being a buyer and a seller are changing and AWS were open to a different kind of partnership.
“We were looking for a partnership that was that was bigger than just an IaaS Migration, which is why we announced the power agreement. Data centres are massive power hungry things, and we’ve got a renewables business… It made sense.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">AWS Wavelength: The Cloud Comes to Your 5G Network</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What is AWS Wavelength? Among a flurry of product announcements at AWS Re:Invent, one drew arguably the most buzz from attendees on the conference floor: AWS Wavelength. Born of four initial partnerships with telecommunications businesses Verizon, Vodafone, South Korea’s SK Telecom, and Japan’s KDDI, the new service — primed for release in 2020 — aims to bring AWS’s compute and storage services “to the edge of 5G networks”. But what does that really mean?
Computer Business Review took a closer look.
There is no magic here — to an end-user the cloud is after all simply services running on third-party infrastructure — and reading between the lines, AWS Wavelength looks set to involve embedding Amazon’s servers at the telco “edge”, from base stations to telco data centres: anywhere it makes sense to put hardware to cut latency.
Emerging interactive applications like game streaming, virtual reality, and real-time rendering among others require lower latency than “classical” cloud services can manage, AWS noted, and even with 5G, if application traffic has to make too many hops before it hits an AWS data centre, latency suffers as a result.
“Today, application traffic has to travel from a device to a cell tower to metro aggregation sites to regional aggregation sites and to the Internet before it can access resources running in AWS. These network hops can result in latencies of more than 100 milliseconds. This prevents developers from realizing the full potential of 5G to address low-latency use-cases”, AWS explained in its release notes.
By teaming up with telcos to embed AWS hardware in their infrastructure, users will get access to AWS services (initially just Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and Amazon EKS, with more to follow) as close as possible to the point of use.
AWS’s Chris Barclay (principle product manager, tech, EC2) explained to Computer Business Review: “An extension of the AWS cloud within the telco environment, AWS Wavelength uses AWS Outposts as a building block to place AWS capacity into these telco facilities and provide AWS services.
“What’s unique about AWS Wavelength is the ability to create an EC2 instance directly within a telco provider’s network. This would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for customers. Imagine having to contact different telcos, and asking for access to capacity in each of their 5G locations.
“And, even if they could get that capacity, it would be nearly impossible to have a common way to manage across all those providers. Wavelength eliminates all this complexity and lets customers use the same familiar AWS APIs, tools, and functionality they use today, to deliver-low latency applications at the edge of 5G networks around the world…
“[by embedding] AWS compute and storage services within the network operators’ datacenters at the edge of the 5G network, application traffic only needs to travel from the device to a cell tower to a Wavelength Zone running in a metro aggregation site. By creating a subnet in one or more Wavelength Zones, such as Verizon Chicago, and launching resources like EC2 instances in that subnet, we give customers the same development experience that they’re used to.
He added: “AWS is responsible for the service. AWS Wavelength Zones are managed by the same control plane as AWS Availability Zones.”
Customers will use the same AWS APIs that they’re used to, and won’t need to know anything about the telco provider’s infrastructure or APIs.
Pressed on whether there are ways AWS is looking to tie Wavelength more broadly into telco efforts to switch to more cloud-native network functions, Barclay said the service is “an extension of the region for running applications in multi-tenant mode, and does not directly tie into cloud-native functions.”
He added: “However, the underlying technology in AWS Wavelength, which is the ability to run AWS virtual infrastructure in telco sites at the edge of 5G networks, can be used for running cloud-native telco workloads. We are actively evaluating and validating various telco network workloads on our edge infrastructure.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was a pleasure to spend time with David Sparks and Stephen Hackett talking about Catalyst apps on the Mac for episode 513 of Mac Power Users. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about and covering Catalyst for the past 18 months since Apple gave developers a sneak peek at it during WWDC in 2018, so it was a lot of fun to join Sparks and Hackett to take stock of where Catalyst stands today and where it’s heading. Of course, we also covered a long list of our favorite Catalyst apps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Procreate 5 brings Animation Assist, rich brush customizations & more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The graphics editor and digital painting app Procreate for iPad by Savage Interactive was bumped to version 5.0 on App Store today, with several new iPad features available in this edition including Animation Assist, Brush Studio and the ability to import Photoshop brushes.
This is the update you’ve been waiting for, marking as Savage’s biggest release so far with literally hundreds of new features and “quality of life” improvements.
It’s powered by an-all new Valkyrie graphics engine that uses Apple’s Metal graphics-acceleration framework to deliver responsiveness of 120 frames per second on supported devices like the 2018 iPad Pro models. Aside from the new CMYK and RGB ICC profiles for print and a new 10-step Color History palette, Procreate 5 supports rich brush customization.
The new Brush Studio section is where you apply total control to your custom brushes with eighteen individual option sliders. You can even take two brushes and combine them to make a unique new brush and style. Brush styles can now be used when cloning, which gives your cloned areas the look of that brush. You can even use your Apple Pencil for tactile control of your brush parameters such as hue, saturation, brightness and more.
With a new Animation Assist feature, anyone can create looping GIFs, storyboards and more.
Topping it all off, the app lets you import your brushes from Adobe Photoshop. And thanks to the power of Valkyrie, the imported brushes paint faster in Procreate 5 than Photoshop.
Here are some of the most important highlights in Procreate 5:
These new features are available at no additional charge to Procreate’s paid users.
Procreate 5 for iPad is a $10 download from App Store.
Procreate Pocket for iPhone and iPod touch is a $5 download.

    <h5 class="mb-1">iPhone 12 could deliver another increase in battery capacity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple’s upcoming 2020 iPhone refresh could bring a slight increase in battery capacity thanks to a smaller battery protection circuit that eliminates the need for a holder case.
The Elec said Monday that Apple’s custom custom battery protection module in the 2020 iPhones is approximately half size and thinner than the units found in previous iPhones.
The new module is built by ITM Semiconductor and said to combine the protection circuit with a MOSFET and PCB, eliminating the need for a holder case, MacRumors explains. Interestingly, the same company has allegedly supplied its new battery protection circuitry to Samsung for its upcoming Galaxy S11 refresh, another The Elec report has it.
This year’s iPhones include advances that have enabled longer battery lives: the iPhone 11 model is rated at about an hour longer than the iPhone XR while the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max deliver an additional four hours of run time than the iPhone XS series.
That’s possible because of several under-the-hood optimizations.
For starters, the A12 Bionic chip is built with TSMC’s 7-nanometer process technology versus the ten-nanometer process used in fabrication of its predecessor. Shrinking the transistors has reduced die size and enabled the chip to run faster while consuming less power.

But more important than that, the current iPhones are ever slightly thicker than the iPhone XS series because they lack a pressure-sensing layer required for the 3D Touch feature, freeing up space inside the device for a slightly more capacious battery.
According to iFixit’s teardown analysis of the iPhone 11:
Another bump in iPhone battery life would certainly be appreciated, Apple!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Card’s new Monthly Installments feature may be about to launch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple is apparently launching soon a new Monthly Installments feature that will permit Apple Card cardholders to purchase things like a brand new iPhone with zero percent financing.
Tim Cook said during Apple’s most recent quarterly earnings call with analysts and investors that 0% financing via Apple Card was in the works and due “later this year”. As reported by the 9to5Mac blog, the Wallet app on iPhone now includes this currently hidden description of the Monthly Installments feature, which appears after tapping the “Learn More” link:
It explains installments aren’t subject to interest like other purchases made with Apple Card.
In other words, you will be able to take advantage of this feature in order to finance your next iPhone purchase, with the monthly payment included in your minimum payment amount every month. The usual Apple Card perks apply here as well, including things such as three percent cash back on your purchase, as well as no fees or other charges.
With less than a month left until the end of this year, the new Monthly Installments option should soon launch for Apple Card customers in the United States.
What do yo think of this upcoming new Apple Card feature?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will Apple kill off the Lightning charging port on its iPhones?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">First, Apple "killed" headphone jacks in 2016, then Touch ID fingerprint scanning went away in 2017 with the iPhone X. Could the lightning cable be next to go?
The iPhone giant is reportedly planning to launch a high-end smartphone in 2021 without a charging cable port, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who works at TF Securities. Kuo has gained a lot of respect in the tech community for nailing predictions of previous Apple products.
The future iPhone will supposedly offer a "completely wireless experience," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors.
Removing the charging port means the device would require wireless charging and may allow iPhones to be more water-resistant. It would mean iPhones are moving one step closer to looking like a flat sheet of glass, an ambitious vision held by Apple's previous head of design Jony Ive, who left the company over the summer.
Apple will get rid of the charging port to "create more differentiation between the highest-end and high-end models," Kuo predicts." The brand's latest iPhones support fast charging, which "gives you a quick and convenient way to recharge your iPhone 8 or later...up to 50 percent in 30 minutes," according to Apple's website.
Apple doesn't respond to rumors, however the move would align with what the tech company is known for.
Apple has long gotten rid of ports and smartphone features to make iPhones appear thinner and sleeker. The tech behemoth first got rid of its wide, 30-pin dock charger in 2012. And many users were upset when it decided to nuke the headphone jack with the iPhone 7 and later models.
The original home button has been gone for years now, and its replacement, the fingerprint scanner, is also in the grave.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demonstration of high-speed SOT-MRAM memory cell compatible with 300 mm Si CMOS technology</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers at Tohoku University have announced the demonstration of a high-speed spin-orbit-torque (SOT) magnetoresistive random access memory cell compatible with 300 mm Si CMOS technology.
The demand for low-power and high-performance integrated circuits (ICs) has been increasing as artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices become more widely adopted. With the present ICs, purely CMOS-based memories such as embedded Flash memory (eFlash) and static random-access memory (SRAM) are responsible for a high proportion of power consumption. In order to lower power consumption while keeping high performance, magnetoresistive random access memories (MRAMs) have been intensively developed. Spin-transfer torque MRAMs (STT-MRAMs) are the most intensively developed MRAM. Major semiconductor companies have now announced that they are ready for mass production of STT-MRAM for eFlash replacement.
Researchers are aiming to replace SRAM with MRAM. For SRAM replacement, MRAM must achieve high-speed operation above 500 MHz. To meet the demand, an alternative MRAM, so-called spin-orbit torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) was proposed, which has several advantages for high-speed operation. Because of these advantages, SOT-MRAM has also been developed; however, most laboratory studies focus on the fundamentals of SOT devices. To realize SRAM replacement by SOT-MRAM, it is required to demonstrate high-performance of SOT-MRAM memory cell on a 300 mm CMOS substrate. In addition, it is necessary to develop the integration process for SOT-MRAM, e.g., thermal tolerance against 400 °C annealing, which is a requirement of the standard CMOS back-end-of-line process.
The research team led by Professors Tetsuo Endoh and Hideo Ohno—the current president of Tohoku University—has developed an integration process for SOT devices compatible with 55 nm CMOS technology and fabricated SOT devices on 300 mm CMOS substrates. The newly developed SOT device has simultaneously achieved high-speed switching down to 0.35 ns and a sufficiently high thermal stability factor (E/kBT 70) for the high-speed non-volatile memory applications with robustness against annealing at 400 °C. Based on this achievement, the research team has integrated the SOT device with CMOS transistors and finally demonstrated high-speed operation in complete SOT-MRAM memory cells.
These achievements have addressed the issues to make SOT-MRAM practical for commercial applications and thus offer a way to replace SRAM with SOT-MRAM, which will contribute to the realization of high-performance electronics with low-power consumption.
Results will be presented at the 2019 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting in San Francisco, December 7-11, 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Building with algorithms: Looking for the optimal design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">How can computers help design optimal buildings? Ph.D. student Koen van der Blom makes algorithms that take into account all kinds of different architectural requirements, in order to reach the best compromise. And that is quite difficult: "Algorithms do not automatically understand that a building that floats in the air is not practical."
The perfect balance
The design of buildings is usually developed by several experts from different architectural disciplines," says Van der Blom. "Every expert has his own requirements. The adjustments made by an expert in discipline A, who looks at the building's load-bearing capacity, may have a negative influence on discipline B, the temperature control." Van der Blom's algorithms should make it easier to optimize building designs for all these different requirements at an early stage. "They search for the perfect balance, which results in better designs. This also saves a lot of time: at a later stage, it takes much longer to adjust."
A complex problem
Designing these kinds of algorithms is quite complex. According to Van der Blom, this is due to several factors. "First of all, we are dealing with a so-called multi-criteria problem. This means that we have to find solutions that balance different requirements." Van der Blom looked at both structural design (such as load-bearing capacity and material saving) and the building-physical design (heating and cooling).
The second aspect is the mathematical representation of the problem. Van der Blom: "It consists of a combination of very different parts. In order to search each component efficiently at the same time, a complex combination of several search techniques was needed."
The last difficulty is dealing with restrictions. These restrictions are necessary to guarantee that the solutions found are usable and valid. "The algorithms do not understand by themselves what makes a building good or bad," explains Van der Blom. "As a result, without further instructions, they also try things that are strange to people. A building that floats in the air, for example, is not a problem for the computer, but we want to rule that out because it is practically impossible." Although such solutions are often not of high quality, and therefore do not end up as a final solution, it does take time to evaluate them. "So we exclude them to save time. We use the time gained to search through a larger number of valid buildings."
From simple algorithm to practice
The search for the right method started with standard algorithms. Van der Blom: "Then we looked step by step at what didn't work properly, for example searching through large numbers of invalid designs, and then we looked for a solution. By slowly adding complexity and knowing that the basis worked well, we were able to find a good solution for one new problem at a time."
Van der Blom worked together with structural engineers from the Eindhoven University of Technology. "We also tested our algorithms at an architectural firm (De Twee Snoeken). That was fairly positive: the algorithms work, but we still need to solve a number of practical problems before we can properly apply them in practice."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the new Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker film coming to a cinema near you on December 20, Samsung has announced a special edition of its Galaxy Note 10+ to get in on the action. Complete with digital content, a collectors badge, a red S Pen, a specially designed case, and a set of Galaxy buds, the bundle naturally also features a Galaxy Note 10+ with a custom design.
Update: The Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Edition is now available to pre-order from Samsung and Amazon for $1,300, with units set to ship on December 13th.
The digital content includes Star Wars-themed wallpapers, shutdown animations, icons, and sounds. There’s no word on whether detaching the S Pen will result in the same sound as drawing a lightsaber, but one can hope. It’s a shame that Samsung skipped from the Galaxy Note 5 to the (disastrous) Note 7 because it could have really gotten into the Star Wars lark by announcing the Sith Edition of the Galaxy Note. That being said, the Galaxy Note 7 did threaten to become the Death Star more than once with its explosive antics.
The special edition of the Galaxy Note 10+ will be available in Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UAE, UK and the USA from December 13 onwards. As for pricing, it’s believed that the Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Special Edition bundle will cost around $1,300.
Are you thinking of splashing the cash and buying the $1,300 Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Special Edition? And if so, would you actually use the handset or would you leave it wrapped and unused as an investment? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MSI Announce Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Game Bundle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MSI is no stranger to offering some pretty amazing bundle deals when you purchase their products. For example, only earlier this week they announced that with the purchase of a monitor, you could grab yourself a free gaming chair.
The latest offer, however, certainly comes with a much wider scope than that. By purchasing any of their qualifying products (across a large range) you can grab yourself a free copy of Monster Hunter World including the latest ‘Iceborne’ DLC! Sounds pretty good to me!
So, what do you have to do to qualify for your free game? Well, if you purchased any of the qualifying products on (or after) December 7th, all you need to do is get in touch with them and they’ll get the Steam key back to you.
Having seen MSI run similar promotions in the past, they’re usually more than quick to get you your game and, better still, if you ask nicely we have known them to occasionally allow a little ‘wiggle room’ for those of you who just missed out on the start date.
What qualifies though? Well, check out below for all products included in the Monster Hunter World promotion:
This is a pretty sweet deal in our opinion. While the gaming chair was also good, that was focused on just one specific product. With this offer available across a vast number of MSI technologies, if you’re in the market for something new, then it’s definitely worth checking out!

What do you think? Are you impressed with the offer? – Let us know in the comments!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google’s first ‘Pixel Feature Drop’ brings improvements to Photos and Duo, Call Screen, and memory tweaks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The December security patch began rolling out last week to a smattering of handsets including most of the Pixels, as well as, surprisingly, the Galaxy Note 9 and Note 10. Pixel 4 owners were left waiting as Google delayed its OTA so that more fixes and features could be crammed into the ‘feature drop’, which is now rolling out.
The ‘feature drop’ brings the usual bug fixes and improvements, including enhanced memory management across all supported Pixel handsets, which means that apps shouldn’t be closed down so aggressively.
Google Photos
Google’s Photos app gains a new trick that enables it to add blur to any photo that you’ve taken, regardless of whether it was shot in portrait mode or not. Depending on the image, the Photos app will alert you to the possibility of tapping the background to add the blur effect instantly or you’ll need to add it manually via the editor.
Call Screen
Robocalling is like the most frustrating game of Whack-a-Mole, as soon as you block one cold caller’s number, another one phones you on an ever so slightly different number. Now the Google Assistant will filter out detected robocalls before your phone even rings, and if it isn’t a robocall? Well, your phone will ring a few moments later with helpful information on who is calling and why. Google says that the Call Screen feature is processed on the phone and does not use Wi-Fi or mobile data.
Duo Call Improvements
The Duo app gets a couple of handy new features which includes Auto-framing that uses the Pixel 4’s wide-angle lens to keep your face centered during your video calls even while you move. And, if another person joins you in the shot, the camera will adjust so that both of you are in view. Playback is smoother with the Pixel 4’s machine learning model predicting the probably next sound, resulting in fewer disruptions.
You can also apply portrait filters when making using the Duo app to make video calls on Pixel 2, 3, and 4 handsets, blurring the background behind you.
Other notable features:
In addition to new features for Pixel 4, the following new apps and features are coming to the Pixel 2, 3 and 3a:
The Pixel feature drop contents will roll out via the December security patch as well as Play Store app updates.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus 8 Lite will bring OnePlus back into the midrange market</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OnePlus really isn’t much of a budget-friendly or midrange brand anymore. When the phones originally launched they were priced well below the flagship category, but that’s slowly crept up over the years. Of course, newer OnePlus phones are also significantly better and have a broader feature set to match high-end phones from the other guys, so it makes sense.
But it looks like 2020 will be the year OnePlus brings back a cheaper phone in their lineup. New renders for the OnePlus 8 Lite have shown up, which should fill out their announcements next year alongside the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro.
The Lite version of the phone definitely looks like something that could be mistaken for a Samsung device, including the flat edges, hole-punch display, and familiar camera module.
It’s supposedly right around a 6.4 or 6.5-inch screen, which is pretty sizable, even for a “lite” phone. It also packs a dual-camera module and potentially a ToF sensor, a pretty slick looking color finish, and a USB-C port, plus the strong possibility of an in-display fingerprint scanner. No headphone jack, though.
OnePlus offered the OnePlus X a few years back, but it was a pretty short-lived experiment in the cheaper section of smartphones. This seems like another stab at that idea, which hopefully goes a bit better this time around.
As soon as we hear anything else about potential specs or features, we’ll keep you updated. I’d be surprised if a phone like this kept things like that high refresh rate display, but you never know for sure with OnePlus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How fashion and technology come together with Huawei Smart Life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to technology, people normally wouldn't associate it with fashion. If anything, the closest thing that most people can think of is perhaps the cool gadgets from the James Bond franchise but the thing is it's already happening now. 
Since the release of the Huawei Mate 30 series, Huawei Malaysia have been trying to rethink design and technology going hand-in-hand together. We have been talking about the Smart Life products for quite a while now, so if you're looking to get yourself a nice Smart Life upgrade, check out what the Mate 30 Pro, Huawei X Gentle Monster Eyewear and the Watch GT2 can do for you. 
Starting with the flagship, the Mate 30 Pro features a few tricks up its sleeve aside from having a Kirin 990 chipset. Using a Horizon Display, the curved edge screen allows a side touch interaction for adjusting the volume controls and taking a selfie, so there's no need for any physical buttons anymore. On top of that, the latest EMUI 10 operating system added a new AI gesture system where you can scroll your phone without touching it, which is great when you're having fried chicken with your hands. There's no need to worry about overheating issues as well since it also has graphene film cooling technology. 
Next, the Huawei X Gentle Monster Eyewear are new smart glasses featuring dual speakers on both of the inner sides. This allows you to listen to your favourite songs and even receive incoming calls without people noticing just like a spy! To receive incoming calls, just double-tap on the exterior side frame and this works for playing/pausing songs too. 
It doesn't stop there too, you can even continue playing mobile games on the phone while using your glasses for network calls. Also, if you take off your glasses while listening to songs or a podcast - it will automatically pause and vice versa! That's pretty cool. 
Finally, the Huawei Watch GT2 lets you count every step, play songs and enjoy other entertainment features while exercising. It doesn't matter if you're walking, running or hiking if you have an incoming call, as long as it's connected to the phone - you will be able to talk on the wearable via Bluetooth just like in those James Bond movies!
The wearable also has a wide variety of themes and styles for those who are looking for cool and beautiful dials. Besides that, the user can access and monitor their heart rate, pressure, and motion record just by using the button operation mode to slide the screen. If you like, the virtual assistant on the watch can also remind you of your heart rate, blood oxygen level and more. 
In terms of sports, you can enjoy multiple gym modes (like swimming) for as long as you like. If you happen to have the 46mm Watch GT2 Sports edition, it can last you for about 2 weeks without any charging experience. Never worry about running out of battery again!
So these are some of the features that can enhance your Smart Life experience, from fashion to living a healthy life, you can experience much more when purchasing the Mate 30 series (from RM2799), Huawei X Gentle Monster Eyewear (RM1599) and Watch GT2 (from RM799). With Huawei committed to building a Smart Life experience, there are also the Matebook 13 (from RM3599), Freebuds 3 (RM679) and the WiFi Q2 Pro (RM499).
The Huawei Smart Life experience is now available in Malaysia, you can check out more information through their official website and Facebook right over here. Stay tuned for more Huawei promotions at TechNave.com.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ripple Director of Product Launches XRP Entertainment Marketplace for Music</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ripple’s director of product is rolling out a new digital marketplace that will allow musicians to sell their songs online for XRP.
Called “xSongs,” the platform utilizes Payburner, an integrated payment system built on top of the XRP Ledger, says Craig DeWitt.
There’s no fee to upload or post songs, and musicians will receive 100% of the revenue from their sales through peer-to-peer XRP payments.
The marketplace won’t support legacy payment methods and allows creators to set their own price.
DeWitt says the short-term goal of the platform is not to make money, but to create a thriving product that increases the usability of XRP.
“If you can build a product that drives significant value to the market, monetization will not be a problem.
Uber loses money on ever [sic] ride they give, but they’ve built something incredibly valuable.”
The project is currently in beta for the uploading/publishing side of the marketplace, which includes a wallet and the ability to manage music.
“Once we’ve gotten enough music uploaded and finished building the front end marketplace, we’ll turn on the purchasing side of xSongs.
This will be the front end to allow anyone to buy songs.” 
That’ll likely happen in a few weeks, after the publishing build-up phase concludes, according to the Ripple executive.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Hyundai Sonata First Drive – Comfort First</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Near the start of this decade, I thought the Hyundai Sonata was perhaps the most attractive mid-size sedan on the market.
I also thought it drove like crap.
The steering was disconnected from the road, it felt slower than its rivals, et cetera.
Hyundai’s next Sonata was better in terms of driving dynamics and on-road behavior, but its styling was conservative to the point of boring. It felt like Hyundai was flailing about, unsure how to build a car that both drove well and looked good, while its rivals were having no problem doing the same. Even its corporate sibling, Kia, was offering up an engaging and handsome Optima.
Enter the 2020 Sonata. It looks good (better from certain angles and with certain colors), but does it drive well? Can it walk and chew gum at the same time?
The answer is: It depends. It depends on what you want from your midsize sedan. Some of you want something sporty, to prove that needing or wanting to own a midsize sedan doesn’t mean you have to give up fun. You’re the parents who don’t go to a fancy dinner when you have a babysitter – you go to the same dive bar you did in your 20s.
Others are looking for comfort. You don’t care if your midsizer is fun to drive, because if you wanted that, you’d shop in another segment. You want sensible shoes.
Then there are those who want the Goldilocks treatment. You want sensibility and practicality and all that stuff, but you occasionally want to attack an on-ramp when you’ve had an extra shot of espresso. Just to remind yourself that you’re not as boring as the guy next to you in bumper-to-bumper.
What, then, is this new Sonata? Stylish yet sensible footwear.
(Full disclosure: Hyundai flew me to Scottsdale, Arizona, and fed and housed me, so that I could drive the Sonata. The company offered sunglasses that I did not take).
When thinking of cars the new Sonata reminds me of, I kept thinking not of the competition but of a dead-car walking in the large-sedan segment – the Chevrolet Impala.
Lest you think I took a wrong turn at Albuquerque and started sampling Walter White’s product, this comparison is limited. The Sonata is not like the Impala in most ways, of course. But like the Impala, it felt all-day comfortable, while still being relatively engaging to drive, if not sporty.
Hyundai wanted us journalists to highlight the car’s styling, especially some of the more interesting details, and some of the car’s tech grades. And I’ll get there. That said, how a car drives is more important to most buyers, methinks, than remote-control low-speed maneuvering or raked headlights or a digital key.
On the road, the Limited I drove with the 1.6-liter turbo engine (available in the SEL Plus and Limited trims; 180 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque) simply felt smooth and generated little wind/road/tire noise. Sure, the roads around Scottsdale are smooth (a world without potholes? Be still my heart), so perhaps the deck was a bit stacked. That doesn’t change the fact that this car is so quiet that gassy passengers will be outed as he/she who dealt it if the driver has the stereo on mute. If you must pass gas in a Sonata that’s not playing any sonatas over the stereo, make it be silent but deadly.
Goose the gas, and the engine does start making noise in the mid-range, but it’s pleasant enough. This engine has what Hyundai says is the world’s first application of continuously variable valve duration – the duration of valve opening is continuously variable in order to achieve the best fuel economy and performance. The 1.6T gains just two horsepower and keeps the same torque number, despite the compression ratio moving to 10.5:1 over 10.0:1.
Sonata’s ride is nice and smooth. Long-haul families, take note: This thing will be a good friend to road-trippers everywhere. It’s not just about a smooth ride or a quiet aural experience – the seats are comfortable enough for long stints.
Dynamics aren’t sacrificed at the altar of comfort – the steering feels well-weighted, and a flick into Sport mode livens the car up a little bit. Even when not in Sport mode, the 1.6 gets you moving with enough authority to make merging and passing a breeze.
If you must have true fire-breathing acceleration, Hyundai has a Sonata N Line on deck for some point in the near future. I got a crack at the prototype; check back in a few days for my words on the subject.
Controls are laid out logically, with the HVAC switchgear taking a simplistic approach. Hyundai went for function over form here, and while the look may be a tad boring, it’s appreciated as a driver.
There’s a bit more flair above, thanks to a large center-stack screen. The menus are mostly intuitive to use, and if you need to calm your road rage, you can command the Bose premium audio system to play nature sounds. Road-trippers with small bladders beware: Two of the nature options are water-based.
Longer (both in wheelbase and overall length), lower, and wider than what it replaces, this Sonata has a sloping rear roofline, a full-face grille, and headlights that rake upwards toward the windshield. Rear headroom doesn’t suffer much compared to the previous model, despite the sloping roof – the difference is just 0.2 inches.
I found the look to be handsome overall, although the large grille struck me as over-the-top, and the car looked better in bright colors. It’s a cohesive look that avoids being too outlandish, and it’s easy on the eyes.
While I drove the 1.6 turbo, the base engine is a 2.5-liter naturally-aspirated four-banger that makes 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines mate to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Available drive modes include normal, sport, custom, and smart (adapts to driver habits to maximize fuel economy and performance).
Like its rivals, Hyundai is offering up a whole bunch of driver-aid tech as standard. The grouping is called Smartsense and includes forward-collision avoidance, smart cruise control with stop and go, lane-follow assist, high-beam assist, driver-attention warning, parking collision-avoidance assist, blind-spot collision-avoidance assist (standard on SEL and up), rear cross-traffic collision-avoidance assist (standard on SEL and up), blind-spot view monitor, and highway drive assist.
The blind-view monitor brings a camera view of your blind spot forth into the gauge cluster each time you flip on the turn signal. It’s a handy feature, especially in urban driving.
I mentioned the digital key earlier. If you have an Android smartphone, you can open the car by placing your phone near the door, and you can even temporarily grant someone else (your kid or spouse, say) access via phone, no matter how far you are from the car. You can also use a near-field communication card to do the same. Hyundai does plan to eventually offer this feature with Apple phones, but couldn’t pin down a time frame.
Hyundai’s BlueLink app allows users to remotely start the vehicle or to check on vehicle info, and available remote smart parking assist allows users who are standing nearby to remote-control the Sonata, which is useful if you’re trying to maneuver into a tight garage.
Other available tech includes a head-up display, customizable gauge cluster, wireless cell-phone charger.
Four trim levels are available: SE, SEL, SEL Plus, and Limited. The latter two get the 1.6T, and the SEL and SEL Plus offer equipment packages – Convenience and Premium for SEL, and Tech for SEL Plus. Hyundai expects the SEL to be the volume seller.
SEs base at $23,400, while SELs add things like heated front seats, blind-spot collision assist, rear cross-traffic collision assist, satellite radio, and dual-zone climate control. The Convenience Package adds the larger 12.3-inch gauge cluster, the digital key, and wireless charging, among other things, for $1,200. The $1,850 Premium Package requires the Convenience Package and adds leather seats, heated steering wheel, and Bose audio. A panoramic sunroof and LED interior lights are available on their own for a grand.
For $27,450, the SEL Plus adds the 1.6 turbo, 18-inch wheels, most of the Convenience Package goodies, and paddle shifters. The Tech Package gets 10.25-inch navigation screen, panoramic sunroof, LED interior lights, highway driving assist, and Bose audio. To fully load your Sonata, and to get the remote-control feature, you’ll spend $33,300 for a Limited.
Destination is $930 for all trims, and the car is on sale now.
Fuel economy is listed at 28 mpg city/38 mpg highway/32 mpg combined in the SE, 27/37/31 in the SEL, and 27/36/31 in cars with the 1.6.
This may be an oversimplification, but the hierarchy of mid-size sedans now appears clear. The enthusiast buyer will be shopping Honda or Mazda, the Goldilocks intender Toyota or Kia, and the comfort shopper will be looking at Hyundai, Nissan, and VW (I haven’t driven Subaru’s new Legacy enough to place it).
Comfort isn’t a pejorative, not in this segment. While some midsize sedan buyers want verve, most just want to get from Point A to Point B with ease, and with little expenditure in fuel or monthly payment. If the car isn’t boring, so much the better.
This is where the Sonata fits in. If you that disappoints you, wait a year or so for the spicier N Line.
Hyundai finally seems to be nailing the dynamics and styling mix, at least if you’re OK with dynamics that don’t quite meet the sport sedan threshold. That’s a recipe for a very good midsize car.
Not great, not bad. Very good. Certainly, one that can walk and chew gum at the same time.
Editor’s Note: A typographical error indicated the 2.5-liter engine made 191 lb-ft of torque. The correct figure is 181 lb-ft. We’ve corrected the information and regret the error.

    <h5 class="mb-1">To Be or Not to Be: That is the VR Question</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Whenever I talk to innovative educators about VR, the excitement and buzz are deliciously palpable. That’s not the usually the case for school leaders, however. Nor is it true for educators of the slow-to-adopt-new-things variety. As evidence, let me mention two recent requests from the leadership at educational conferences, both asking me to highlight in my presentations not only when it makes great sense to employ virtual reality in learning, but also when it makes no sense at all.
The underlying question they knowingly agitate for is “When and under what circumstances should educators steer clear of virtual reality?”
Tackling the question of when it makes sense to employ virtual reality in educational settings is an easier proposition, as I usually turn to research-based suggestions. We can comfortably move forward with VR in instruction:
On the other hand, wrestling with the notion of when educators or training specialists should NOT use VR has some obvious and less obvious twists. At the risk of treading on dangerous or controversial ground here, here’s my current thinking. We should think twice before using VR in educational settings:
There are some important lessons for manufacturers, resellers and integrators that can be learned from the above discussion. Turn your attention, for a moment, to your sales literature, your demonstration tables, your exhibit hall booths, your elevator speeches and booth talks, or your value-added premise. How do I showcase a VR product? What use cases are on the tip of the tongue? What stories do we tell? If we are trying to reach the broader education market (K12, higher ed and industry), are our best stories and examples coming from the “when NOT” category listed above? It’s a huge customer-facing mistake to unconsciously showcase the NOTs—especially to leaders of these respective education industries. It’s also wise not to run away from the NOTS, to ignore them entirely or dismiss them as “never happening”. Instead, we should “lean in” to advantages, especially advantages other than the typical engagement and knowledge retention pablum. —Len Scrogan

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shipments of Wearables Surged 94.6% in 3Q19 [Report]</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Worldwide wearables shipments surged 94.6% in the third quarter of 2019, according to the latest IDC report. Most of the growth is being attributed to the hearables market which accounted for almost half of wearables."Hearables have become the new go-to product for the wearables market," pointed out Ramon T. Llamas, research director for IDC's Wearables Team. "This began with multiple vendors removing the headphone jack from their smartphones, driving the move toward wireless headphones. It continued with hearables incorporating additional features that either augment or expand the audio experience. Next, hearables have taken on multiple form factors – ranging from truly wireless to over-the-ear headphones – appealing to a broad base of earwear user preferences. Finally, prices have come down significantly, with some reaching below $20.""The rise of smart assistants in the home and on the phone has led to an increased demand for wearables that have the ability to connect with these assistants," said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. "With multiple form factors and the inclusion of smart assistants, the wearables market is well on its way to becoming a mass market device category rather than one that primarily caters to health and fitness."Wearables Company Highlights● Apple captured the top position thanks to the growing popularity of the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones. Looking ahead, the price reduction on the Series 3 Watch as well as the launch of AirPods Pro leaves Apple in a strong position to maintain dominance in this market for the short term.● Xiaomi's popular Mi Band lineup shipped more than 10 million units during the quarter and the company was able to significantly expand its global reach by targeting countries in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region.● Samsung's new watches and hearables (both self-branded as well as JBL-branded) captured 9.8% of the market. To date, the company has been able to successfully bundle its smartwatches and Galaxy buds with its smartphones and this strategy has paid off as many carriers around the world helped promote Samsung's lineup.● Despite political challenges, Huawei ranked fourth globally thanks to a strong performance in its home country of China. Within its borders, Huawei grew 188% year over year, making it one of the fastest growing companies in China. In the rest of the world, Huawei maintained strong growth though shipment volume was much lower as roughly 80% of its shipments were concentrated in China.● Fitbit rounded out the top five and the company's latest wearables and watches have been well received though it still struggled to grow during the quarter. The latest news regarding its acquisition by Google fills the brand's future with uncertainty.
Product Category Highlights● Earwear posted the highest year-over-year growth and amassed the most market share compared to all other wearable products. While the 3Q19 results established a new record for a quarter, it also set up 4Q19 with a strong foundation from which to build.● Wristbands maintained their popularity within the market, ahead of smartwatches and other wearable devices, driven by its straightforward value proposition and lower price points. On top of this is the increased functionality that allow some wristbands to mimic the capabilities of their smartwatch cousins, keeping them relevant in the market.● Smartwatches tracked closely to, but finished slightly behind, wristbands during a quarter in which many companies relied on older models while customers eagerly awaited new models heading into 4Q19. Still, with significant markdowns available, price-sensitive customers took advantage of the lower prices for devices capable of many, if not most, of the features of its newer cousins.Read More

    <h5 class="mb-1">It’s Time To Find Your Top Nine Instagram Moments From 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the end of the year inches closer, it’s time to find your Top Nine Instagram moments from 2019 and share as an image, video, or Story.
So, you’ve reached that time of the year again – perfect for looking back on what has happened, what you’ve been listening to, what you’ve been watching – and what you’ve been posting, too.
So, what better way to look back on your Instagram exploits than the annual Top Nine grid?
Yup, the grid is back, but there’s more to it than meets the eye. This year, you can share your Top Nine as an image, video, Instagram Story, and more. The developers behind Top Nine say they have “focused on video and story templates” this year, with videos and Stories-sharing only available in the mobile app on iOS or Android.
Please do note, however, that video templates are only available on iOS for the time being.
If all you want to do is download the usual Top Nine grid, all you have to do is go to topnine.co, enter your Instagram username and email. You can then download your Top Nine grid as a 1080×1920-pixel image, including the grid itself and the number of likes received by your account in 2019. You can then just upload it wherever you want as it is – or crop it.
The desktop version doesn’t support video, but you can download the mobile app, and use it to generate and share a video of your Top Nine posts for 2019.
Don’t expect a perfect experience as this is still a work in progress. As Beta Labs, the company behind Top Nine, explains, “We still have a lot to polish, as the app still has a few rough edges. We’ll release new updates in the next few days fixing many details, improving designs, and including new video templates.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier, TVS updated the Apache RTR 160 4V to meet the BSVI norms. The motorcycle was launched for Rs 99,950 ex-showroom Delhi.
The BSVI TVS Apache RTR 160 4V gets power rated at 16.02PS at 8,250rpm and 14.12Nm at 7,250rpm. The torque number is down by 0.68Nm. The engine comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. The RTR 160 4V gets a single-channel ABS. Both the motorcycles get telescopic suspensions in the front along with a monoshock in the rear.
While the review of the motorcycle will be out soon, here is a close look at the new TVS Apache RTR 160 4V that is BSVI compliant.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nike Is Pulling Its Products From Amazon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nike is overhauling its retail strategy and ending the pilot program with Amazon, which brought its sneakers and apparel to the world’s most viewed storefront.
In the era of mass e-commerce, one would think that most brands would fight for a place on Amazon. There is one that has decided against it, though; Nike. Here’s a little bit of the background:
Back in 2017, Nike and Amazon entered a mutually beneficial agreement that would see the athletic brand start selling its products on the online marketplace. In return, Amazon would intensify its efforts in eliminating counterfeits from its platform.
However, after two years, the deal is over. As first reported by Bloomberg, the company has decided to pull its products from Amazon to focus its efforts on distributing its products through a network of select retailers.
There are rumors that the deal just wasn’t living up to Nike’s expectations, but whatever the truth may be, the brand has always had a tradition of creating immersive and exclusive retail experiences. Therefore, it would be safe to assume that Nike would also like to focus on a distribution network that preserves the brand’s ethos – rather than appealing to the mass market.
The statement is further reinforced by the brand’s spokespersons, with sources saying that “as part of Nike’s focus on elevating consumer experiences through more direct, personal relationships, we have made the decision to complete our current pilot with Amazon Retail.”
The news comes amidst a wave of changes for the brand, an important one being the departure of Mark Parker, the man who helmed the sneaker giant for the last 13 years. Board member John Donahoe will replace Parker as of Jan 13, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spec Comparo: KTM 390 Adventure vs Royal Enfield Himalayan vs BMW G 310 GS vs Kawasaki Versys-X 300</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The KTM 390 Adventure, we have been seeing the test mule of the motorcycle in India and this adventure tourer has finally made a global debut at the 2019 EICMA. That said, the 390 Adventure will be launched in India tomorrow with an expected price tag of Rs 3 lakh, ex-showroom. Given that KTM is running late to the party, the Indian market has already seen the introduction of a few adventure motorcycles in the segment such as the Royal Enfield Himalayan, BMW G 310 GS and the Kawasaki Versys-X 300.
Engine and drivetrain
The Royal Enfield Himalayan gets the highest capacity engine, meanwhile, the Versys-X 300 is the only one here with a parallel-twin cylinder layout. The BMW G 310 GS gets the smallest engine here.
While the whole bunch gets a 6-speed transmission, the Himalayan is equipped with a 5-speed gearbox.
Power figures
The KTM 390 Adventure gets the highest power as well as torque figure but given the Himalayan's engine tune, the peak power and torque comes in earlier in the rev range. The Versys-X 300 gets a high power figure but has the least amount of torque on offer.
Electronics
KTM has upped its game by offering a traction control system in the entry-level adventure motorcycle market. Also, an IMU-based cornering ABS system that can be turned off. Other motorcycles only come equipped with a dual-channel ABS.
Cycle parts
When the 390 Adventure was showcased at 2019 EICMA, the motorcycle was equipped with fully adjustable suspensions on either end. The one showcased in India misses out on the adjustable suspension. That said, the 390 Adventure still gets the beefy-est forks upside-down in the front. While the Versys-X 300 and BMW G 310 GS get 41mm upside-down forks, the Himalayan gets 41mm telescopic forks.
Pricing
The Himalayan is the most affordable in the lot while the Versys-X 300 is the priciest. The KTM 390 Adventure is expected to have an ex-showroom cost of sub three lakh rupees which will then position it under the BMW G 310 GS as well.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Php 61 million gets you this special Nissan GT-R50 by Italdesign</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nissan isn't slowing down on the 50th anniversary celebrations of their halo sports car, the GT-R. After unveiling the GT-R 50 concept by Italdesign earlier this year, they have made the production model official. Much like before, only 50 will be built.
Just about every panel of the high-performance coupe was changed by the Italian design house. From the bumpers, fenders, doors, and quarter panels, no part was left untouched when Italdesign got their hands on it. The headlights, for instance, are totally different from the GT-Rs you see in showrooms, and the front end, and the grill is much wider than the standard model. Despite the changes, it's still recognizable as a GT-R from the front.
The same goes for its flanks. Italdesign changed just enough for the GT-R to look more aggressive than usual. Its roof line is more sloped than the standard GT-R, but retains the look of the sports car thanks to the blacked out pillars and squared-off rear windows. As for the rear, that's where the most dramatic changes are seen. The rear windshield, trunk lid, and fascia were given a retro-futuristic look, and it's capped off by the active rear spoiler.
Inside, it gets a unique dashboard with Alcantara laid down on the top part and embellished in carbon fiber at the center. The infotainment is unique to this model, as well as the door panels and the deeper bucket seats.
But it's not just a cosmetic upgrade either. Powering the GT-R 50 is the same 3.8-liter, twin-turbo V6 that's been under the hood of this car for quite some time already, but that's where the similarities end. This one gets much more power, rated at a whopping 720 PS and a staggering 780 Nm of torque. Keeping that power on the road is a re-tuned all-wheel drive system to handle the extra power.
Want one? You still have a chance. Surprisingly, there are still stocks of it left but it won't exactly be the most affordable GT-R out there. This one will set you back a cool $ 1.2 million, which is about Php 61,000,000 at current conversion rates.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aporva Baxi: “Brand and UX must not be forgotten in the streaming wars”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In his famous 1996 essay Content is King, Bill Gates predicted that “content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting”. 
And how right he was. Content is now the supreme weapon for brands vying for your attention in the streaming wars.  
Content is the reason why Disney pulled its owned IP away from Netflix and has invested heavily in promoting its huge catalogue heavy-hitters, from Marvel to Pixar to Star Wars. Consequently, this is also why Netflix has been forced to invest upwards of $17.5bn on original content this year.  
Much has been made over this scramble for content. But in reality it’s only half the battle.  
The user experience of the brand and the design systems of these streaming services are every bit as important as the content itself. If content is king, then the brand is the throne on which it sits. 
Nike doesn’t sell trainers – it sells the idea of you becoming a better athlete. Apple doesn’t sell Macs and iPhones – it sells the idea of changing the world with technology.  
These attitudes tell an audience what to expect – that’s how a brand that fits into the lives of audiences grows a relationship. Channel 4’s editorial perspective means audiences can expect sharp, alternative content whether it is a comedy, drama or documentary. With HBO audiences expect gritty, adult content with complex narratives.  
“We have great exclusive content” isn’t a value. You need to offer a unique perspective on the world. In streaming, Disney+ isn’t access to exclusive content – it’s access to magic, dreams and life’s great stories. These values allow brands to resonate in people’s lives.  
Equally the brand equity of Apple and Disney also means users expect a quality experience – despite neither having ventured into the streaming arena before. The strength of the brand gets you into the life of audiences – whether that’s on a TV, or as an app on their phone – the quality of the content and the system that delivers it then connects them to the service. Design plays a key role here.   
A design system needs to be robust and have a strong theory. This means you need a system which is agile and capable of adapting to the audience wherever they are experiencing it – from watching via a tablet on a plane to watching at home on the sofa. The design must seamlessly delight in every moment of the experience. Every interaction is the brand. But design must also deliver against the brand voice and values.  
It is difficult to avoid getting lost in the sea of sameness when creating such a design system. There is a typical ‘way’ of delivering content – data can inform where is the best place to put a particular thing on the screen – but you need to remain conscious of your own brand and ensure you are distinct from the competition.  
If you let data systemise your design, you will end up competing on the same field as everyone else. If you let brand values systemise your design, you can create something unique that differentiates you in the minds of audiences.  
Disney can’t feel like Netflix. A system that works well but looks like an Excel sheet would still discourage users. Design needs to be both highly-functional and embossed with the personality of your brand.  
The need to balance brand personality vs user experience is the cause of friction between designers and developers worldwide. But the sense of discovery and excitement needs to be balanced with the reality of keeping people hooked.  
Take Netflix introducing auto-playing trailers for its original content. These techniques might effectively attract user attention and increase awareness – but does it ultimately have a negative effect on the user experience?  
Streaming services should be conscious that every interaction is the brand. A user may love Breaking Bad but if the design system that delivers it is jarring it is potentially more damaging to the Netflix brand than a bad show. It is important to delight as much in the small moments as you do in the big.  
While working to reimagine the All 4 experience we created the streaming ‘playbar’ – a brand system which expanded horizontally to become an infinite stream connecting every channel and every show. This created an experience which was slick and effortless across TV and digital interfaces and delivered a unified All 4 experience for users. 
During our work redesigning an American network streaming service, we faced the challenge of finding the right balance between how the UX serves the fan and the optimum level of brand visibility. We understood that the content needed to take centre stage – so we developed a design system which steps into the background to connect fans to the content they love as quickly as possible.  
A successful design system balances the content and the brand to put a smile in the mind of its users.  
Bill Gates was right to recognise the power of the internet to distribute content. But when it comes to determining who will emerge as the streaming king, content alone is not enough.  
In the world of streaming if you remove tentpole content from a brand that isn’t strong, the brand will collapse. Whereas tentpole content that is removed from a strong brand can be replaced.  
Strong brands have the ability to cut through a crowded place. But a strong brand needs a strong perspective. The brand that will claim this throne is the one which makes an intuitive leap into the future and moves away from the conventions we have seen emerge. You can’t iterate your way to transformational change.  
Services need to think beyond streaming. The term isn’t fit for purpose. It suggests that the act of streaming is a one-way relationship with the viewer passively being delivered content. If you think about the process in terms of streaming you are forgetting about what really excites audiences. Brand, content and user experience all need to merge to deliver on the viewer’s terms. That’s what keeps us watching.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2020 Hyundai Creta to don Palisade inspired design</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At the Shanghai Auto Show earlier this year, Hyundai showed off the heavily updated version of the ix25 - a crossover that is essentially the Creta underneath, with a few differences here and there. The new design of the ix25, however, may not work well in the Indian scheme of things - at least not as it is. One of the strongest attributes for the Creta is its upright, SUV-esque stance, which the new ix25 doesn't quite mimic.
The updated 2020 Hyundai Creta will, therefore, wear a design similar to the Hyundai Palisade - the company's flagship SUV. On the face of it, the design themes adopted by the Palisade and the ix25 are quite similar, but it is the finer details that make the difference. For example, the brow of the new Creta won't be a smallish unit like the ix25 and instead, will extend all the way to the grille like the Palisade (a la Kia Seltos). The cascading grille too will have a seamless one-piece design, which will be sharper and more imposing than the ix25's unit. The detailing of the bumper-mounted headlights will be different too and like the rest of the facial elements, the design will aim at giving the front end a more upright stance compared to the ix25.
At the rear, Hyundai India is likely to chuck the split design for the lighting elements seen on the ix25 and go with a more Seltos like design that will highlight the width of the car. The new Creta will also sit on a longer wheelbase than before, achieving a roomier cabin.
The cabin is said to get a grey and black treatment, along with a larger sunroof, ambient lighting and two-step reclining rear seats. The infotainment system will be similar to the Palisade, with a new 10.25-inch horizontal touchscreen system with Hyundai's BlueLink connectivity and SOS feature. We expect more functionality added to the BlueLink suite to surpass the Seltos. We would rather have Hyundai bring in the larger vertical screen seen on the ix25, with integrated AC controls. We are told that the top-spec trims of the Creta will receive digital instrumentation too. Alongside a two-zone climate control, like the Venue and Seltos, there will be an integrated air purifier too.
The powertrain options will be similar to the Seltos - BSVI compliant 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines and a 1.4-litre direct-injection petrol - all available with manual and automatic transmissions. This isn't the only similarity with the Seltos. On certain variants, there will be driving and terrain modes too.
The 2020 Hyundai Creta is expected to be launched in India around June/July 2020 and will command a slightly higher premium over equivalent Seltos variants.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BSVI Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 launched in India for Rs 1.45 lakh - Gets a drop in power figures</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 was updated with a dual-channel ABS in January 2019. The update was in regard to the stricter safety norms regulated in the country. Speaking of the norms, the Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 has now been tuned to meet the emission standards of BSVI. And in the trade, the motorcycle has lost 0.7PS of power and 0.6Nm of torque. Also, the BSVI model is dearer to its customers. The price has been hiked from Rs 1.39 lakh up to Rs 1.45 lakh ex-showroom Delhi.
Even with the drop in power, the YZF-R15 V3 is mechanically identical to the BSIV model. Carries the same 155cc liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine and the power rating stands at 18.6PS at 10,000rpm and 14.1Nm at 8,500rpm.
Along with the cleaner running engine, the R15 V3 now gets features such an engine-kill as it senses the kickstand has been lowered. And dual-horn will be a standard offering.
The cycle parts remain unchanged and the motorcycle gets telescopic forks in the front and a multi-link monoshock in the rear. The braking system with dual-channel ABS has been carried forward as well.
The motorcycle has been launched with three colour options - Blue, grey and Matte black.Following is the colourwise break-up of the BSVI Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 -
Thunder Grey - Rs 1,45,300Racing Blue - Rs 1,45,900 Darknight - Rs 1,47,300
All prices are ex-showroom Delhi.
Commenting on the launch, Motofumi Shitara, Chairman, Yamaha Motor India group of companies said, "Our commitment towards customers in India is underlined in exciting products and experiences of The Call of the Blue. Being a cult brand that grows refinement and a rage, Yamaha is thankful to the customers in India who have cultivated the passion of R15 with their high taste of sensation and performance. With Yamaha continuing to perk up track performances with the R series, the new YZF-R15 Version 3.0 with BSVI compliant engine and new features will be able to create optimum excitement in India in its respective category. Yamaha strived for optimum cost control for the new BSVI compliant YZF-R15 Version 3.0 and achieved to peg it around three per cent higher along with new standard features, only to let the unrestrained excitement of R Series rev hearts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Catching Up: NatWest Adds More Features to Banking App</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The race to compete with emerging Fintechs is compelling most all banks to up their game. This is good for the consumer. Better service and lower costs (hopefully). If traditional banks want to survive ongoing iterations and a willingness to change is vital. Today, NatWest is updating their banking app with features that are already widely available elsewhere. These include the ability to track spending and automatic categorization. Low hanging fruit in the world of banking.
NatWest Chief Digital Officer Frans Woelders says that the more engaged customers are with their money, the better their financial health.
NatWest says they already enable users to view all accounts, even from other banks, within their App – something Open Banking makes simpler to do.
The NatWest app features have been built on tech provided by the European PFM provider, Tink –  a Fintecch chosen as a partner for the project due to its experience of developing user-friendly finance apps for banks. Soon, NatWest expects predictive data on spending will be available too.
Expect more features to be added by NatWest in the coming months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buy/Drive/Burn: Japanese Two-doors for a New Century</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last time on Buy/Drive/Burn, we took a look at three two-door, mid-market offerings from American brands for the 2001 model year. Most people hated such a Sophie’s Choice.
Perhaps things will be a bit better today, as we cover the same market segment with offerings from Japan.
Toyota Camry Solara
Toyota brought back a two-door Camry for the 1999 model year, though it was not in the format some buyers expected. Instead of a standard Camry with two fewer doors, Toyota presented a sporty take on the idea and added the new Solara moniker. Underneath, Solara was based on the prior-generation Camry and built in Ontario. Camry engines of 2.2 to 3.0 liters were used, with five-speed manual or (mostly) four-speed automatics on hand for shift duty. A 2001 facelift revised the grille, tail lamps, and headlamps, and brought different wood. The base engine from 2001 was upgraded to the 2.4-liter mill from the Camry. Today’s selection is a base model 2.4L with a five-speed manual.
Mitsubishi Eclipse
A new third-generation Eclipse debuted for the 2000 model year, and boy was it a big deal at the time. With sporty, plastic-clad and slab-sided styling, the Eclipse said New Millennium in a big way. Riding on the Chrysler ST-22 platform with the Sebring coupe we saw last week, the Eclipse was powered by 2.4- or 3.0-liter engines, with four-speed automatics or five-speed manual transmissions. There were seven trim levels of Eclipse, and the most basic one was the RS. Today’s choice, it came with the 2.4-liter SOHC Mitsubishi engine and the manual transmission.
Honda Accord Coupe
Nothing was particularly revolutionary or unexpected about the sixth-generation Accord, even in slightly more rakish Coupe guise. Introduced for the 1998 model year, it was nearing replacement in 2001, though the generation broke SOPs and carried on five model years. In late 2000 Honda revised North American Accords with new front fascias, side skirts, bumpers, tail lamps, and wheels. Trims in 2001 were four for the Coupe, and included two levels (four- and six-cylinder) of LX and EX. Today we’ll have an LX with the 2.3-liter inline-four and five speed manual.
Look at all these manual transmissions! Which midsize Japanese two-door gets your cash in 2001?

    <h5 class="mb-1">MOBI to Develop Mobility Payments Network for Machine-to-Machine Transactions Based on Blockchain </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOBI, the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, is exploring blockchain for use in a new digital mobility ecosystem that could make transportation safer, more affordable, and more widely accessible. According to reports from Bloomberg on December 8, the non-profit organization is developing a blockchain-based payment network that allows for machine-to-machine transactions.
The Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), a consortium for blockchain innovation in the mobility industry founded by leading automakers including Toyota, Renault, Ford, GM, and BMW, it is ever closer to the realization of vehicles capable of communicating autonomously with one another.
Chris Ballinger, the person in charge of the non-profit initiative, aims to create an automatic payment system that would allow cars to turn into real wallets that send and receive cryptocurrency transactions. This system would allow the data collected by vehicles to be monetized as drivers would earn small sums for sharing data on everything from traffic congestion to weather, whilst also be debited for infrastructure use and contribution to pollution.
However, this type of innovation could present problems according to Brent Toderian, former chief city planner in Vancouver. According to him, it is necessary to find a balance between technological development and the needs of a city. This type of invention could lead to an increase in the use of cars, impacting negatively on the environment.
But this innovation represents a fundamental step to avoid leaving the mobility sector left behind in the digital age. Tech giants are entering any market and thanks to their tremendous technological advantage they can potentially compete in any sector. To keep up with the times, you need to speed up this process, explains Bellinger.
He adds:
The key to success is not just to get cars to communicate with each other. The goal is to create real smart cities in which all the infrastructure will be in communication with the vehicles present. To do this, in addition to advances in technology, we need to revolutionize the way devices communicate.
So far sensors have been constructed in to be compatible only with one platform, but the new generation will need to open this up so all devices can speak to each other; it is precisely in this direction that MOBI is working.
Although there is nothing specific yet, Bellinger explained that MOBI could consider using a stablecoin as the mean of payment for its Mobility Payments Network.
The project aims to revolutionize the way cities are designed as well as provide a real-world use case for digital currencies beyond speculation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A prompt for writing this piece is a conference I will be participating in tomorrow entitled Antitrust in Times of Upheaval — A Global Conversation; you can livestream the conference here.
I opened 2017’s Defining Aggregators by stating:
This Article is explicitly related to that piece: unlike most Stratechery items, this Article is not based on a specific news event that happened recently, but is rather an attempt to collect a number of ideas and thoughts I have expressed in different Articles, Daily Updates, and Podcasts about Aggregators, platforms, and regulation. I will link to several of those Articles throughout.
The most important place to start is by pointing out the excerpt above makes what I now believe is a critical mistake: it conflates platforms and Aggregators. In fact, I believe platforms and Aggregators are fundamentally different entities, and understanding how and why they are different is the single most important task facing would-be regulators.
I explored these differences in 2018’s Tech’s Two Philosophies, The Moat Map, and The Bill Gates Line. This is how I illustrated platforms:
The name “platform” is a descriptive one: it is the foundation on which entire ecosystems are built. The most famous example of a platform — one with which regulators are intimately familiar — is Microsoft Windows. Windows provided an operating system for personal computers, a set of APIs for developers, and a user interface for end users, to the benefit of all three groups: developers could write applications that made personal computers useful to end users, thanks to the Windows platform tying everything together.
What is critical to note about Windows, though — and this extends to newer platforms like iOS and Android — is that it was essential for the ecosystem to function. Developers could not write applications for another operating system if they wanted to reach users, and users could not use a different operating system if they wanted to use popular applications.
Aggregators are different. This is how I illustrate them:
“Aggregator” is also descriptive: Aggregators collect a critical mass of users and leverage access to those users to extract value from suppliers. The best example of an Aggregator is Google. Google offered a genuine technological breakthrough with Google Search that made the abundance of the Internet accessible to users; as more and more users began their Internet sessions with Google, suppliers — in this case websites — competed to make their results more attractive to and better suited to Google, the better to acquire end users from Google, which made Google that much better and more attractive to end users.
Notably, unlike platforms, Google is not essential for either end users or 3rd party websites. There is no “Google API” that makes 3rd party websites functional, and there are alternative search engines or simply the URL bar for users to go directly to 3rd party websites. That Google is so influential and profitable is, first and foremost, because end users continue to prefer it.1
Here is a way to visualize the difference:
To be clear, both roles can be beneficial — platforms make the relationship between users and 3rd-parties possible, and Aggregators helps users find 3rd-parties in the first place — and both roles can also be abused.
The potential impacts on competition by Platforms and Aggregators are broadly similar, differing mostly by degree:
Vertical foreclosure: Platforms can make it impossible for 3rd-parties to function on their platform, either through technological means or, in the case of smartphone platforms, by leveraging their gatekeeper role in terms of App Stores.
Aggregators can also ban 3rd-parties — Google can remove a site from search, or Facebook can remove links from the News Feed — but they cannot force that site to simply not exist. Users can still reach those sites via other search engines, links, or by typing in the URL.
Rent-Seeking: Instead of blocking third-parties, platforms can simply extract money; this often works in conjunction with the threat of foreclosure. Apple, for example, does not allow apps that have their own payment processor, or that even link to a website with payment functionality; they are, however, happy to offer their own payment processor, complete with 30% fee to Apple.
Aggregators, meanwhile, make it increasingly difficult to reach end users without paying for advertising; Google and its expansion of vertical search categories like travel is a perfect example. However, Aggregators do not have as strong of a vertical foreclosure stick as do platforms.
Tying/Bundling: Platforms can include additional functionality or applications that have nothing to do with the platform, but rather leverage the platform to gain market share. The most famous example of this is Windows bundling Internet Explorer, the legality of which was never settled in the United States; the Appeals Court remanded the case to the District Court because of concern a per se application would chill innovation (and in this case Microsoft has been proven right: all operating systems come with browsers now).
This is arguably the true Aggregator stick when it comes to rent-seeking: to return to the travel example, online travel agents may not be happy about paying to be a part of Google Search’s travel module and the hit on margins that entails, but it is better than Google launching its own OTA.
Self-Dealing: Platforms can give their own products advantages, often through special APIs that are not available to competitive products. For example, real-time co-authoring of Microsoft Office documents only works in the Office desktop apps if the documents were opened from OneDrive, but not if opened from Dropbox or Box.
For Aggregators, this advantage is more about putting their competitive product in front of users. Google local results, for example, are not even listed in the Google index, yet they are inserted at the top of the search engine results page (SERP).
The question for regulators is when these abuses should lead to action.
That certain companies have advantages or earn sustainable profits is not a sufficient reason for regulators to act; innovation deserves its reward. Moreover, the presence of abuses like those detailed above is also not necessarily a sufficient reason for regulators to act: regulation can have a chilling effect on innovation, it can be ineffective, and it can incur significant opportunity costs on both companies and regulators. Regulators should focus their attention and resources on abuses for which there is no other recourse than regulation.
This is where the distinction between platforms and Aggregators is critical. Platforms are the most powerful economic and innovation engines in technology: they create the possibility for products that never existed previously, and are the foundation for huge amounts of innovation. It is in the interest of society that there be more and larger platforms, not fewer and smaller.
At the same time, the danger of platform abuse is significantly greater, because users and 3rd-party developers have no other alternative. That means that not only are anticompetitive actions unfair to products that already exist, they also foreclose the creation of an untold number of new products. To that end, regulators should simultaneously encourage the formation of new platforms while ensuring those platforms do not abuse their position.
From a practical standpoint, this means that platforms should have significant latitude in mergers and acquisitions, but significant scrutiny in terms of vertical foreclosure, rent-seeking, bundling, and self-dealing.
Apple is the pre-eminent example here: the iPhone specifically and the entire iPhone ecosystem generally has benefitted tremendously not only from Apple’s internally-created innovations but also from acquisitions like P.A. Semi, which led to the creation of Apple’s A-series of chips. However, the combination of Apple’s total control over 3rd-party app installation and rent-seeking on in-app payments has, in my estimation, stunted innovation and opportunity in the app ecosystem.
Aggregators are different. Yes, they provide value to end users and to third-parties, at least for a time, but the incentives are warped from the beginning: 3rd-parties are not actually incentivized to serve users well, but rather to make the Aggregator happy. The implication from a societal perspective is that the economic impact of an Aggregator is much more self-contained than a platform, which means there is correspondingly less of a concern about limiting Aggregator growth.
For the same reason, though, Aggregators are less of a problem. Third parties can — and should! — go around Aggregators to connect to consumers directly; the presence of an Aggregator is just as likely to spur innovation on the part of a third party in an attempt to attract consumers without having to pay an Aggregator for access. Moreover, there is a Sisyphean aspect to regulating power predicated on consumer choice: look no further than the European Union, where regulators are frustrated that remedies for the Google shopping case aren’t working, even though those same regulators were happy with the remedies in theory; the problem was trying to regulate consumer choice in the first place.
It follows, then, that regulatory priorities should be the opposite of platforms: given that Aggregator power comes from controlling demand, regulators should look at the acquisition of other potential Aggregators with extreme skepticism. At the same time, whatever an Aggregator chooses to do on its own site or app is less important, because users and third parties can always go elsewhere, and if they don’t, that is because they are satisfied.
Here Facebook is a useful example: the company’s competitive position would be considerably shakier — and the consumer ad-supported ecosystem considerably healthier — if it had not acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, two other consumer-facing apps. At the same time, Facebook’s specific policies around what does or does not appear on its apps, or how it organizes its feed, has no reason to be a regulatory concern; I would argue the same thing when it comes to Google’s search results.
There is one additional area where regulators should focus: advertising. Advertising is a core component of Super-Aggregators like Facebook and Google because the incentives are perfectly aligned: Facebook and Google want to serve everyone, which means they want to be free, while advertisers want to have access to everyone, which means coalescing around the largest Aggregators.
First, this results in a type of market failure when it comes to problematic content, as I detailed in A Framework for Regulating Content on the Internet. Second, the sheer scale of the core Aggregator gives a massive scale advantage that can be applied elsewhere; Google in particular is much more of an inescapable platform when it comes to advertising on third party sites; this is where regulatory scrutiny should be focused.
There is one final component to this analysis: if platforms and Aggregators are to be treated differently, regulators need a more flexible way of considering when is the correct time to step in.
Consider the three regulatory issues that I implicitly suggested deserve more attention in this piece: Apple’s App Store policies, Facebook’s acquisitions, and Google’s third-party advertising offerings. None of them fit under a popular conception of a monopoly: Apple sells a minority of smart phones, Facebook acquired Instagram when it had only 30 million users, and the advertising market is both not consumer-facing and has infinite supply.
That doesn’t mean harms don’t exist, though: the apps and services that aren’t created, the advertising-based consumer services that are under-monetized (Snapchat and Twitter) or that aren’t even being funded, and the multitude of websites that can’t realistically even try innovations that entail going around Google.
That, though, is why I am writing this piece. Cases like the European Commission Google Shopping case are excellent examples of how a lack of clear standards lead to sub-optimal outcomes that don’t actually change anything; at the same time, the European Commission’s investigation of Apple’s App Store will surely benefit from increased flexibility in defining relative markets.
Ideally, there would be stricter adherence to better rules, instead of finger-crossing that Brussels gets it right. That, though, likely requires new laws. Indeed, while that seems like a slog, it should, in my estimation, be the focus of those interested in a future where we direct tech’s innovation towards making a larger pie for everyone, as opposed to cutting off slices because it makes us feel better, even if only temporarily.
I wrote a follow-up to this article in this Daily Update.
Google also, to be clear, pays significant amounts of money to ensure it is the default on iOS, and basically built Android to ensure it is the default everywhere else. The European Commission correctly found Google’s contractual moves to secure its position on Android illegal [↩]

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple CEO Tim Cook probably hasn’t coded for many a year. However, it was a key part of how he got into the tech industry.
No surprise then that Mr. Cook publicly marked Computer Science Education Week. Mr. Cook visited Apple Marunouchi in Japan. There, he was joined by Rikkyo Primary School. The appeared to have taken part in a Today at Apple course to start learning some computer science skills. Mr. Cook tweeted that “coding is one of the most important skills you can learn.”
Today at Apple sessions include one called “Getting Started with Swift Playgrounds.” Another is focussed on children. It is called “Coding Lab for Kids” and teaches them using a Sphero Robot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Tap View may be introduced, may only work via NFC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung isn’t only busy with smartphones. The South Korean tech giant also has a smart TV business that competes with a lot of other OEMs. We don’t mention Samsung smart TVs as much but the company may be introducing a new feature–the Samsung Tap View for screen mirroring to a smart TV. Nothing is final and official yet but the idea is a phone can do screen mirroring to a TV. Think something similar to Chromecast but this time, from Samsung.
Details are scarce but we understand the screen mirroring may happen through WiFi or maybe even NFC. Sighted on the EU IPO is SAMSUNG Tap View. Trademark has been filed on December 5, 2019. The description lists the following:Televisions; Smartphones; Tablet computers; Wearable computers in the nature or smartwatches and smartglasses; Smart watches; TV monitors; Video monitors; Software with the ability to show the screen of a mobile devices to a television monitor by tapping the mobile devices to the television; Software allowing the mirroring or mobile device screen to television screen by tapping the mobile devices on the television.
It could be any from the description above. We can understand there may be a tapping motion of a mobile device to a TV. Tap the smartphone to the smart TV and the content of the phone may be displayed on the screen.
This becoming a reality is not impossible. Google has been offering Chromecast for several years now. It’s the easiest and most convenient we’ve used so far. Hopefully, Samsung will offer something similar but easier, faster, and more reliable.
Samsung already has something similar too. We remember SmartThings and AllShare Cast too. Both have built-in Screen Mirroring. The next screen mirroring technology may probably eliminated the need for WiFi connection. It could only rely on Near Field Communication/NFC. It’s possible as Sony has already done it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tata Altroz first drive review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tata first showed their premium hatchback concept called the 45X at the Auto Expo in 2018. The production version named the Altroz was exhibited at the Geneva International Motor Show in 2019 and it was also scheduled for a 2019 launch. But Tata Motors decided to delay the market introduction of the Altroz to January 2020, because they wanted it to have BSVI compliant power plants right from its launch.
The Altroz is Tata's first vehicle to be based on the all-new ALFA (Agile Light Flexible Advanced) platform. This is a new modular architecture and is one of the two platforms on which all future Tata Motors products will be based. Tata says this new platform is scalable and has been designed to adapt to multiple body styles like the hatchback, sedan, MPV and even that of the compact SUV.
Things like the wheelbase, track, etc, can be changed and it has been engineered to be light but rigid, and Tata claims they have used modern technology and an energy absorbing structure for advanced safety. This ALFA platform is versatile and also designed to provide good luggage space; it has a flat floor to maximise leg space; it can support multiple power trains and is also capable of hybridisation and electrification.
Styling
The Altroz is the second vehicle (first being the Harrier) designed under what Tata terms as its Impact design 2.0 language. For the longest time, Tata Motors was very conservative with its design, so much so that each iteration and generation of the Indica looked similar. Then maybe due to popular perception or customer feedback, Tata Motors presumably decided to adopt a new design approach, first with its highly radical Nexon, and then the Harrier. In my opinion Tata has now gone from 'one extreme to another'.
Their new designs, including the Altroz, are very brave and eye-catching and no longer can one say that Tata vehicles don't get noticed or look dull. While I am all for Tata's adventurous approach in design which I think they need to be complimented for, the end result I think, could be more aesthetically appealing.
Take the new Altroz which we drove recently in Jaisalmer. It retains a lot of the styling and design elements of the 45X. Concepts are designed to be noticeable. But generally by the time they go into production, several of the more conspicuous aspects get toned down. But thanks to Tata's bold approach, the Altroz certainly looks flamboyant and has several dramatic styling elements like the prominent kink that starts from the A-pillar and flows into the door from where it becomes the rising centre beltline.
The headlights also sweep upwards and thanks to the chrome surround garnish which kind of elongates them, they appear longer and almost span the length of the bonnet! The front grille is designed to look like a visor from a futuristic helmet, but compared to rest of the sleek front, it does seem a bit upright. The SUV type wheel arches, which add muscle to the otherwise sleek profile of the Altroz, in my view also don't do a lot for the overall attractiveness.
The Altroz also has lots of blacked out portions or what Tata describes as "tastefully integrated piano black accents". The blacked out roof looks good as does the blacked out portion on the tailgate. But I am not sure about the portion below the side windows which gives the impression of extending the glass area. I am also keen to see how well all this black ages, especially in a sunny and hot country like ours. There is nothing worse than a part of your vehicle looking more aged than the rest.
Interiors
Compared to the daring design approach on the outside, the interiors are somewhat tame in comparison. The design is conventional with the centre of the dash being dominated by a large seven-inch touchscreen that comes with many features like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, SMS readout, voice commands, etc. The display has attractive graphics and three pre-built themes called Zeal, Zing and Zen that control things like the colour of the display and instrument panel, sound, climate control, etc.
Tata has packed the Altroz with many premium features like rain sensing wipers, auto headlamps, ambient interior lighting, wearable key for passive entry, umbrellas stored in front door pads, Harman speakers and tweeters, smartphone-based navigation, and so on.
The Altroz has a flat-bottomed steering wheel and Tata says that they opted for it to improve ingress and egress. It is thick, sporty-looking and feels very nice to hold and is one of the best features on the Altroz.
It also has an easy to use horn button or ring that goes all around the steering boss. The other thing that I am really impressed with is the massive 15-litre cooled glove box. It has various slots and cavities for all your papers and knick-knacks, and also a removable tray that increases the useable space substantially. This has to be one of the biggest and best glove boxes in the business.
The instrument cluster is semi-digital with an analogue type speedometer and digital RPM meter. In a departure from conventional design norms, the tachometer is placed on the left and speedo on right and in between you have the fuel guage and a digital cluster space that displays other vehicle information. The digital RPM meter indicator needle is difficult to read as it blends in with the background and this lack of contrast means you have to concentrate harder to know the engine revolutions.
The seats are well-shaped and comfortable and the driving position unlike in several other Tata products is very good. The passenger compartment is spacious but sitting in the rear can get a bit claustrophobic due to the rising window line and small glass area. The wider than normal rear armrest provides good comfort and the door armrests are covered with soft fabric that is kind to your knees. There is also a sliding armrest on the front and the Altroz offers 345 litres of luggage space, but the loading lip is quite high.
The entire passenger compartment feels well-finished with good quality materials and the Altroz has what Tata terms as wing 90 doors which open 90 degrees to allow better ingress and egress. But thanks to the sharply sloping A-pillar, you have to watch your head while getting in or out. Ingress and egress at the rear is a little compromised too, as the floor is low and the higher door sill is a bit like a step that you have to go over, and this is not so convenient. The fact that the doors open so wide also means you have to be careful not to hit them on the walls or cars parked on the sides.
Engine and transmission
The Tata Altroz comes with a naturally aspirated 3-cylinder petrol engine that makes 86PS and 113Nm of torque. It feels a bit underpowered and you have to rev it hard to make any real progress and it gets quite vocal when pushed. In comparison, the 1.5-litre diesel appears far more refined. It generates 90PS and 200Nm of torque.
The additional torque gives it good punch and far better drivability and though it will be substantially more expensive than the petrol version, it's the engine I would opt for. The Altroz has two driving modes; City and Economy, but the button to switch between them has nothing written on it. The diesel weighs 1,150kg, which is 114kg more than the petrol and both power plants come mated to a 5-speed manual. The shift quality and precision with which you can select the slots on this transmission, is easily the best yet in a Tata vehicle.
Driving Impression
The Altroz also has the best driving dynamics of any Tata vehicle so far. The new ALFA platform feels strong and stiff and the suspension is very well-sorted too. It deals with all imperfections in the road in an impressive manner and the ride is comfortable without being too stiff. The body roll is also well-controlled and the steering feels nice and accurate and is suitably weighted.
The braking is confidence inspiring and even under hard braking, the Tata Altroz holds its line. The pedal feel and modulation is good too. While the handling also appears to be predictable and the Altroz should stay well planted on twisty roads, we could not really put this to the test on the arrow straight roads around Jaisalmer.
The large windscreen and sharp rake angle mean more light hits the front and top of the dash which results in irritating reflections and glare on the lower part of the windshield. The base of the door mirrors also has a chrome garnish and at certain angles, it reflects the sunlight directly into the driver's eyes, which is really very distracting and disturbing.
Initial thoughts
The Tata Altroz will compete with the likes of the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Honda Jazz, Hyundai i20, etc, and though Tata has not announced the price, they should price it competitively in the Rs 5 to 8 lakh range. In my opinion, the Altroz is Tata's best vehicle until now, and one that also has all the ingredients to match up to the competition.

Recently, renowned digital artist 'Jonsibal' released a rendering of a Supra without a roof. While that may sound cliché', he was able to transform what is originally a coupe into something better, a speedster.
Looking at the open-roof Supra, Jonsibal was able to slice off most of the top. The windshield also appears to be more rakish in order to deliver better airflow. Not only that, he was also able to incorporate a cool front splitter, and a pair of sideskirts that further enhances the speedster's overall looks. Finally, the topless Supra rolls on huge BMW alloy wheels derived from the E28 5 Series.
Will we actually see a convertible version of the all-new Supra? With Toyota's lineup currently lacking a convertible offering at the moment, the case for a topless Supra hitting the road is very slim. However, Lexus did reveal the all-new LC 500 Convertible at this year's Los Angeles Auto Show, showing that there is still a niche for open-top vehicles under the Toyota brand.
But some might argue that the BMW Z4 is already the convertible version of the Supra. Should there be enough clamor for a drop-top Supra from customers however, perhaps Toyota may actually make one. Tetsuya Tada, the chief engineer behind the Supra, has actually thought about making one.
If ever Toyota does plan to build one, maybe they could get some inspiration not just from the Z4, but from Jonsibal's render too. Let's hope there will indeed be one in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Electric vehicle charging station map goes live</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drivers of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles can now easily plan their journeys using the newly-introduced live map to locate available public charging stations across SA.
The live map, announced today, is part of an initiative by Jaguar South Africa and public EV charging stations installer, GridCars, to display the entire network of Jaguar Powerway and GridCars-supported public charging stations online to map the public charging stations, while also indicating it’s online or offline status.
The map, accessed via Jaguar SA’s Web site, also shows the exact location and the time and date of the station’s last successful use, as well as a tally of that particular station’s total charge sessions to date.
“While the primary charging habit for the majority of EV drivers will be at home where it’s most convenient and cost-effective, we know that the future of electric mobility ultimately relies on a public charging network,” explains Brian Hastie, network development director of Jaguar Land Rover South Africa.
“As the rollout of public charging stations intensifies and the dots between existing locations are connected, it’s vital that EV drivers are able to view the status of chargers remotely. This live map makes that possible.”
Almost a thousand EVs have been sold in SA to date. In March, Jaguar Land Rover became the third vehicle company to introduce an EV range in SA, with the Jaguar I-Pace. The first were Nissan Leaf, introduced in 2013, and BMW i3, introduced in 2015.
According to charging infrastructure mapping Web site PlugShare, the local public charging network currently consists of 137 charging stations based along the major routes across SA.
In October, eight new EV public charging stations were installed at four sites across the country through a partnership between the Department of Transport and the Gauteng Provincial Government, in collaboration with digital solutions provider Generation.e and electrical products manufacturer ACDC Dynamics.
Last month, Airports Company South Africa collaborated with BMW SA to introduce EV charging stations at OR Tambo International Airport, Cape Town International Airport and King Shaka International Airport.
Jaguar South Africa began the roll-out of its Powerway network of public charging stations late in 2018. The Powerway includes public charging stations along frequently travelled holiday routes along the N1, N2 and N3, and at various points of convenience, such as shopping centres, in the country’s major hubs including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Bloemfontein.
The R30-million Jaguar Powerway investment, combined with the network of GridCars-supported public chargers, makes day-to-day travel as well as longer day trips and even very long journeys possible for owners of EVs, according to Jaguar.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Glass Explorer Edition will get its final update next year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google has been quiet about the Google Glass project. The last update we featured was about the Glass Enterprise Edition 2 allowing efficiency and speed in production. That was back in May. That last update appeared a year after we shared with you the misses and hits of Google’s many projects. Today, we’re sharing with you what’s about to happen since the tech giant recently announced through the support site that a final software update will be released next year. Early in 2020, Google will also remove support for such wearable devices.
Removal of support means the Google Glass Explorer Edition will no longer be able to work with a Google account. Access to backend services will also be gone. Please note that this particular update will not affect the Google Glass Enterprise Edition–only the Explorer version.
Actually, there is no official announcement. A document was simply sighted on the Google Support website. Google says there the Glass update must be installed manually. This means a signed image file must be downloaded, unzipped, and then run on a series of commands provided by Google.
To continue using the Google Glass Explorer, the update must be applied. Otherwise, you won’t be able to sign in and use the Glass properly beginning February 25. It may still work but some apps like Gmail and YouTube will no longer work.
Do get the said update and pair your Glasses with your smartphone. You can continue to enjoy the wearable device and be able to sideload apps and capture images and videos as intended. We’re not sure about Google’s next plans so we’ll see.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Assistant now lets you create lists, search for podcasts and share photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google on Friday added a range of new features to Google Assistant in an effort to simplify voice-enabled productivity.
“Starting to roll out today, you can use your Assistant to create and manage your notes and lists in Google Keep, Any.do, AnyList, or Bring! across Assistant-enabled phones and smart speakers,” the company said on its news blog.
Users can now enable support for third party list apps via the Assistant, where they can say things like “Hey Google, create a holiday gift list”. Additionally, users can use the Assistant to search for and listen to podcasts too.
“When you ask the Assistant for podcasts about a certain topic — ‘Hey Google, find a podcast about holiday cooking’ — it’ll suggest relevant episodes for you,” Google explained.
Meanwhile, users can also ask the Assistant to search for photos and share them directly by saying “Hey Google, look up photos from this weekend”.
According to Google, the new features are available on all Assistant-enabled phones.
In November, the company also released a news-reading Assistant feature in the United States.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antec Performance P120 Crystal Case Now Available</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antec has just released the new P120 Crystal PC case. It aims to be a competitive mid-tower for just 99 EUR (MSRP inc VAT). It’s ticking all the right boxes for a PC gaming build too. It features two sides of tempered glass, plentiful radiator and fan mounting space, and room for a massive GPU.
What I really love is that it features a vertical GPU mount with support for a triple-slot card. That means that even the most beastly GPUs on the market today can be mounted on their side.
Users can install VGA cards with a length of up to 450 mm and CPUs with a maximum height of 185 mm as well as PSUs with a maximum length of 294 mm.
The new P120 Crystal measures 475 x 232 x 480 mm. Build from 0.8 mm and 1 mm steel and finished with tempered glass front and side panels. It’s a great looking case, and as well made as rival offerings.
The mid-tower model features large interior space for E-ATX, ATX, micro-ATX and ITX motherboards. The isolated power supply chamber and drive cages are positioned on top of the chassis. The sleek tower offers space for two 2.5” or 3.5″ HDDs and two 2.5″ SDDs and seven horizontal and three vertical expansion slots. To keep its cool, the P120 offers space for three 120 mm or two 140mm case fans at the bottom, one 120 or 140 mm fan in the rear as well as up to three 120 mm or two 140mm case fans on the side of the chassis.
The Antec P120 Crystal is available now from Amazon in the UK and many other PC retailers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vodacom, SAPS power crime prevention via app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vodacom’s partnership with the South African Police Service (SAPS) to launch the MySAPS mobile app is part of the company’s transition to being a purpose-driven organisation.
This is according to Rudi Matjokana, managing executive for public enterprise at Vodacom Business, saying in addition to supporting national crime prevention efforts, the company seeks to ensure digital inclusion for all.
After a soft launch in August this year, Vodacom and SAPS unveiled the MySAPS app in October, with the aim to bring police services to the palm of the citizens’ hands.
The free app, developed and enabled by Vodacom, is available for devices running Android and iOS operating systems. For those that have feature phones, it can be accessed via USSD.
Matjokana told ITWeb Vodacom wants to enable and empower private and public organisations as well as help digitise government services to serve a broader society.
“Our purpose-driven mission is to connect people and things to the Internet. We also want to ensure inclusion for all and improve people’s lives.”
MySAPS app enables citizens to search for the nearest police station, submit a tip off, call the crime stop number, visit the SAPS Web site, as well as send messages, according to Matjokana,
He says the app is “for everyone’s safety”.“This is how we are changing criminal reporting. A person can report criminal acts as and when they see them and the police will act on it. You can report anonymously and the police will still act on whatever you say you need them to do.”
While he didn’t provide specifics in terms of how many times the app has been downloaded, Matjokana noted the reception has been quite good. “It’s just that we don’t have enough man power to be going around helping more people download the app.
“Every citizen should join us on this journey; we should not leave anybody behind. We should make sure that everybody can have access to these services [and] the Internet.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cover image via HUAWEI & TechGoondu
By heading to the HUAWEI Online Official Store, you'll be able to redeem your RM200 voucher and use it on 12 December 2019. Yas, discounts are the best. :)
That's right, we Malaysians were the first in the world to get a glimpse of the HUAWEI Nova 5T ahead of it's global launch. Positioned as a lifestyle smartphone, the HUAWEI Nova 5T is for those who value top-notch performance, insane camera features, and aesthetically-pleasing design.
Coming with five different cameras - four on the rear and one on the front, the HUAWEI Nova 5T aims to capture that picture-perfect moment every single time. The rear Quad-AI camera setup consists of a 48MP main camera, a 16MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth-sensing camera. The depth-sensing lens helps with that buttery-smooth bokeh for portrait modes, which is always a plus!The 32MP front selfie camera is actually hidden under the 6.26-inch 'All-View Display'. This provides a flawless, unobtrusive content viewing experience, without any unnecessary distractions. 
Another neat feature of the Quad-AI camera setup is the ability to shoot stunning lowlight photography via the AIS Super Night Mode, which drastically reduces noise while still retaining as much light as possible. This is an especially useful feature for those who love the contrast of brightly-lit subjects in darker settings.Say goodbye to grainy night-time shots! ﻿
At the heart of the Nova 5T is the world's first 7nm mobile AI chipset, which lets you enjoy a super fluid, super smooth user experience, without any nasty lag. The dual-NPU setup enables the Nova 5T to take on even the most demanding tasks, like hardcore gaming and even a long day of multi-tasking! The power of the Kirin 980 chipset is also complemented by 8GB RAM and 128GB ROM, featuring ultra-fast storage (UFS) technology.Optimum performance at an efficient level of power consumption. What more could you ask for? :D
It's tiring when you have to wait for your phone to charge up before you can finally use it for your daily content viewing pleasure. The HUAWEI Nova 5T gets rid of that burden by packing a fairly decent 3,750 mAh battery, coupled with 22.5W SuperCharge technology. Just how fast is this charging technology exactly?It's pretty zippy. It takes just 30 minutes to get from a dead battery to 50%. That means you get to spend less time waiting for your phone to charge, and more time actually using it to its full potential!
The HUAWEI Nova 5T comes in three different colours - Black, Blue Crush, and Midsummer Purple. The exclusive Midsummer Purple variant also gets a special Nova monogram on the back, just to add to the stylish look of the device. The 6.26-inch 'All-View Display' provides a 91.7% screen-to-body ration, which means you'll really be able to see ALL of your content in such a pleasing screen size. The front-facing camera itself is placed on the top-left corner of the screen, hidden from direct line of sight. That means you're able to focus on your content, and just your content alone!The phone also uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, making it super ergonomic for daily use, since our natural grip usually rests our thumb (for right handers) and index finger (for lefties) where the sensor is positioned. No fumbling about here. :)
You can get this amazing discount, plus other cool freebies when you redeem the online voucher on 12 December 2019! Freebies include the HUAWEI AP38 SuperCharge car charger, a Nova gift box, and a tripod - all amounting to RM285. :D

    <h5 class="mb-1">Toyota RAV4 beats Mazda3 as Japan's Car of the Year 2019-2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All around the world, there are several organizations of automotive journalists that hold their own version of COTY (Car of the Year) awards, but Japan's -without a doubt- is one of the most recognized.
Recently, the selection committee of Japan Car of the Year composed of the country's top automotive journalists announced the final results of their tally, and have awarded the fifth-generation Toyota RAV4 as their top automobile.
According to JCOTY, they awarded the RAV4 because the SUV “responded to all needs at a high level”. They liked the 3 types of all-wheel drive system being offered in the RAV4, and they also cited the advantages of the new platform used by Toyota, the TNGA, as being both enjoyable and comfortable. Pricing and luggage space were also highly rated, along with the Japan-exclusive data communication module.
The RAV4 is the 40th vehicle to take the title as Japan's Car of the Year, succeeding the Volvo XC60 from 2018-2019. This is Toyota's first top JCOTY win since JCOTY 2009-2010 with the Toyota Prius. Moreover, the RAV4 beat out the Mazda's new Axela (aka Mazda3), the second placer in the JCOTY rankings.
Many had expected the Mazda3 to take the win as their new generation vehicles have had a very successful history of wins at JCOTY in the last decade such as the Mazda CX-5 in 2012-2013, the Mazda2 in 2014-2015, as the MX-5 in 2015-2016. But in this year's selection, the RAV4 beat the new Mazda3 by a big margin.
It wasn't all about the RAV4 though, as JCOTY also awarded the top import, which in their assessment is the BMW 3 Series sedan. The committee liked how the new 7th generation model maintained the personality of the sports sedan, and improved on the driving feel both in terms of comfort and dynamics.
JCOTY also announced that the Nissan Skyline won their Innovation Category for its many technological advancements such as ProPilot 2.0, while the new generation Jeep Wrangler won the Emotional Category to cars with the best drive feel and design. The closely related Nissan Dayz and Mitsubishi eK series of vehicles won the category for small mobility.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Extending security to the cloud</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Business leaders now have a choice whether they want to continue using their trusted firewall, or move to a next-generation firewall delivered by appliances or as cloud services to protect the outer perimeter security in branch offices.
Troye technical director Kurt Goodall says Citrix offers various choices, from the long-established multi-site to the advanced multi-layered approach, both of which can protect users and data at the branches, data centre and clouds from multi-vector cyber threats.
"Citrix SD-WAN Integrated Firewall complements your trusted firewall investment and strengthens overall security infrastructure. Citrix provides an integrated perimeter firewall that masks users and infrastructure from cyber surveillance," he explains.
This integrated firewall has global policy control, supports zone-based policies so you can implement granular micro-segmentation of traffic and enforce uniform policy consistently. Citrix SD-WAN can also intelligently track the fast-changing open ports from SaaS and IaaS apps as trusted traffic and directly break-out the traffic to the Internet, enhancing application performance.
It marks all other traffic, such as Web browsing, as untrusted, and forwards it to the full security stack, typically located at the HQ or a private data centre. Citrix SD-WAN also takes extra precautions by encrypting all branch-to-branch egress traffic, even when it is transported over a private MPLS line.
Goodall says Citrix SD-WAN automates connectivity to cloud security. "With most enterprises embarking on some form of cloud transformation, Citrix recommends extending perimeter security to the cloud, where apps and workloads reside."
Citrix has partnered with industry leaders like Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler and Symantec to deliver joint solutions that enable our SD-WAN to be a transparent gateway for Secure Web Gateway (SWG) service. Cloud-based SWG is a popular option for branch offices due to its simple yet effective multi-layer protection.
Citrix SD-WAN management platform is the key component in this joint solution, providing on-boarding automation and a direct subscription link to Palo Alto Global Protect (aka Prisma) and Zscaler Secure Internet Gateway services. Through API automation, Citrix SD-WAN also secures the connectivity (via IPsec) from the branch to the Palo Alto, Zscaler and Symantec clouds.
The benefits of automation become more significant as more branch sites are involved, directly translating into time savings and reduction in configuration errors. Last but not least, Citrix provides this automated on-boarding capability free of charge.
In addition, cloud-based security also enables a new service-consumption model. It provides an option to shift to opex spending, which can be easily aligned with your business growth. There is no need to deploy security appliances at every branch. It also removes the need to build an in-house resource to manage the security infrastructure.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Airtel Announces Out of Bundle Rates, Revamps Amazing Data Bundles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Airtel Kenya has today launched out of bundle rates, which comes after Safaricom launched a similar product some time ago. These have a new tagline which is #BeSurewithAirtel
In the previous system, Airtel charged Kshs 4.3 per MB for out of bundle rates which meant that using 5MB of data cost you Kshs 21.50 or if you used 50MB, that would cost Kshs 215!
In the new system, that same 5MB of data will only cost you 1 KES while 50MB of data will only cost you 10 KES.  They will also charge Kshs 2 per minute for calls. All you have to do is dial *544*2# according to Airtel.
This is a great move for the over 12 million Airtel customers who will get out of bundle data at cheaper rates.
This is a very smart move by Airtel to have ‘no expiry bundles’ without necessarily having no expiry bundles. By substantially lowering the price of out of bundle rates, Airtel customers can estimate how much their airtime would last them when they are online.
Airtel is also revamping their Amazing Data Bundles. The company is now giving more data bundles for the same price. The Amazing Data bundles have an expiry period just like before, but now Airtel has decided to double the data offerings in some cases
Here are the new prices which you can compare with the old rates:
*CLARIFICATION*
We’ve made changes to the article that explains further the new out of bundle plans that Airtel introduced yesterday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kenya’s second-largest telco Airtel has launched non-expiry data, months after its rival Safaricom launched a similar product.
In the new plan, 5MB of data will cost Ksh1, and a Ksh2 call rate across all networks will be applied.
Unlike the traditional method, subscribers will not be required to buy data bundles, but will have to subscribe to the service with no conditions, according to the telco.
According to Prasanta Das Sarma, CEO Airtel Kenya, the service comes as a game changer in the market for subscribers who complain of data and airtime expiry.
Read: Safaricom Introduces Non-Expiring Data Bundles After Outcry
Safaricom launched its non-expiry data and airtime on October 23, after a public outcry concerning the expiry of the two.
Previously, a lawyer and ICT practitioner Adrian Kamotho had dragged Safaricom, Telkom, Airtel to court over the expiry of data bundles.
Also on the list of respondents is the industry regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA).
The demands intensified after all telecommunication companies in Ghana were directed by the government to do away with expiry of data bundles and airtime, a practice that is common in most countries.
Ghana has four major telecommunication companies which include MTN, Vodafone, Airtel Tigo and Glo, and all will be affected by the directive.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Galaxy A51 will be unveiled soon, here’s when</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Samsung Galaxy A51 is coming. Early image renders presented quad cameras. Just a few days ago, it was also teased on video. The follow-up to the Galaxy A50 is already in the works and some new details are surfacing. It’s definitely coming and a launch date has been given. On December 12, the South Korean tech giant will be announced. So far, we know this mid-range phone offering will feature a punch-hole display that will house the 32MP selfie shooter.
Design-wise, the Samsung Galaxy A51 may look more like the Galaxy A50s. It may also arrive with a flatter display. There won’t be a notch. It seems the Galaxy A series will continue to use the centered punch-hole design.
The Samsung Galaxy A51 may also retain the 3D Glasstic build. The new image we see features new pastel shares. We’re probably looking at Prism Crush White, Pink, Blue, and Black.
At the rear is an L-shaped camera system featuring four sensors. When it comes to dimensions, the Samsung Galaxy A51 is said to weigh 172g and measure 158.5 x 73.6 x 7.9mm. We see some physical buttons on the right edge of the phone.
The phone specs are as follows: 6.5-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-O, FHD+ resolution, 32MP front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture, Exynos 9611 processor, 64GB or 128GB onboard storage, 4GB or 6GB RAM, 64GB or 128GB onboard storage, and a MicroSD card slot for expansion, on-screen fingerprint sensor, and a 4000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. As for the rear cameras, expect the following: 48MP f/2.0 primary sensor, 12MP ultrawide f/2.2, 5MP depth sensor, and a 5MP f/2.4 Macro camera.
So the Galaxy A51 is confirmed. We’ve been confusing this with the Samsung Galaxy A71 but looks like the Galaxy A51 is final. We’ll get to see on the 12th of December.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forget the smart home, it's all in the cloud now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five years ago, when I started writing regularly for MNN, I thought that my focus was going to be on The Internet of Things and the Smart Home. In my first post, What is the smart home? It's too soon to tell, I wrote: "We are at the beginning of a new era ... Nobody knows how it's going to work or what it's going to do, but it's going to be quite a ride."
In fact, the smart home has been a big dud. There are a few smart thermostats and light bulbs out there. My Apple Watch and iPhone are marginally more sophisticated. About the biggest advances we see are in the proliferation of devices like the Amazon Echo, where we can ask Alexa to deliver stuff to our homes; otherwise, most of the changes in the last five years have been in the cloud, in services that we pay for rather than things that we own. So one reason that car ownership is dropping is that more people can use services like Uber, and more people are ordering in food made in "cloud kitchens" that exist without restaurants, preparing food for delivery only. I wrote on MNN earlier:
On sister site TreeHugger, I noted that cloud kitchen companies were inventing new brands, so that you can order any kind of food, sort of a virtual food court from a crappy mall. The best demonstration of where this is going is Rachael Ray to go, set up by Uber and supplied by cloud kitchens. She tells Bloomberg "a virtual restaurant gives me a more specific relationship to people in my audience. It’s me, joining people for dinner."
You can get old, waiting for the smart home to happen, and I've been doing exactly that, which is why I've been writing more and more about issues affecting aging baby boomers — how we live, how we get around, how we eat. And it's beginning to look like we may be among the biggest beneficiaries of these cloud-based services, as we ask Alexa to order up everything from medicine to food to services and have Uber or Amazon deliver them to our doors.
It's already shaking up the "active adult" and "independent living" senior communities, where providing food service is a key attraction but a major money-loser, and residents often complain that the food is boring or monotonous. One California provider to primarily Indian residents now uses cloud kitchens instead of its own. According to Senior Housing News,
Takeout food has a reputation for being full of salt and fat, and one commenter to my TreeHugger post noted that users of cloud kitchens would end up "poor, fat, and buried in plastic waste." But cooking for one can be extremely expensive and wasteful, while food from cloud kitchens doesn't have to be. Swiss investment bank UBS suggested in a study that efficiencies in purchasing and production could actually make it cheaper and more efficient. "The total cost of production of a professionally cooked and delivered meal could approach the cost of home-cooked food, or beat it when time is factored in."
I've devoted a lot of space to cloud kitchens because they're a good example of how things are changing. In that post five years ago I wrote about the smart revolution: "We have no idea where it's going to take us, what our cities and homes will be like, how it will change the way we live. It never works out the way we think it's going to."
And it hasn't. We are indeed getting a revolution, but it's a revolution in services, not stuff. The senior housing operator using a cloud kitchen may soon find that people don't need as many of their other services either; anyone can order in. That's why I question the billions being invested now in retirement homes. With the huge baby boomer cohort getting older every day, there will likely be an explosion in cloud-based services, letting people stay out of senior homes much longer. We will be monitored by our watches and phones and hearing aids and there is nothing that we can't get through our iPhones or our Echos.
We still have no idea where the smart revolution is going to take us, but there will probably be a Google map for that. It's still going to be quite a ride, but probably on an Uber bike or Amazon truck.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Early leaks of Huawei’s next flagship Kirin 1020 and midrange 820 chips are great</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Their latest flagchip Kirin 990 (5G) launched mere months ago but Huawei’s Q3 2020 flagchip Kirin 1020, and its midrange and likely sooner brother Kirin 820, have dropped and feature great improvements.
Huawei has a strong history in the semiconductor industry with their own long series of excellent ‘HiSilicon’ mobile chips which they have used in their smartphones instead of purchasing processors from other companies like Qualcomm, and they launched their latest and greatest Kirin 990 (5G) flagchip in September with the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro.
Said Kirin 990 and its 5G variant were both designed on Samsung‘s currently latest 7nm EUV process and featured huge performance gains in AI and also featured an integrated 5G modem (in the slightly more powerful 5G variant), though Huawei did opt to utilise ARM‘s 2018 Cortex-A76 core architecture, previously featured in the Kirin 980, Snapdragon 855, and Exynos 9820, rather than ARM’s latest Cortex-A77 architecture over what Huawei claims were power consumption issues.
Huawei also launched a midrange Kirin 810 chipset earlier this year which was, on all accounts, a very powerful chipset which managed to slightly outperform Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 730 chipset on all fronts with more efficient power consumption.
Despite just how recent those chip launches are, though, leaks of Huawei’s next-gen 2020 flagchip Kirin 1020 and midrange Kirin 820 have sprung up and reveal a small but tantalising piece of info beyond the two chips’ names, being a few key specs of the 1020:
@RODENT950 has tipped that both the Kirin 1020 and Kirin 820 will be full 5G chips (with no 4G-only variants), and further and juicily leaked that the flagchip Kirin 1020 will use Qualcomm’s latest Cortex-A77 cores (though by Q3 2020 there will be newer, but unusuably early Cortex-A78 cores available) built on 5nm which will purportedly – and believably (architectural improvements plus lithographic improvements) – deliver nearly a 50% CPU performance improvement over the Kirin 990 5G.
Such a performance improvement would be a huge leap and would solidly put the Kirin 1020 in the mobile performance lead, ahead of the upcoming Snapdragon 865 and Exynos 990 which have each been officially announced to feature Cortex-A77 on 7nm EUV with a claimed ~20% performance improvement over the likes of the Kirin 990 5G.
Of course, it’s early days yet for Huawei’s next-gen chipsets; refinements are always possible as is the possibility of a dud leak (though I personally find these proposed specs very likely, and the >40% performance improvement believable), so we’ll have to stay tuned to learn more.
The Kirin 1020 and 820 sound great though.

The HUAWEI Y9s equipped with an ultra wide angle 48MP AI Triple Camera to deliver outstanding photography, the HUAWEI Y9s also features a 6.59-inch HD FullView display and perfectly integrated front-facing pop-up camera for a boundary-free viewing experience.
With looks to match the outstanding specifications, the HUAWEI Y9s’ design is inspired by the concept of ‘time aesthetics’. Available in two styles; ‘Breathing Crystal’ and ‘Midnight Black’ the HUAWEI Y9s combines nature’s beauty with modern craftsmanship in a stylish design that sets a new standard for entry-level smartphones aesthetics.
Glass Made Back Panel for Stunning Design Aesthetics
Echoing the mirror-like qualities of the front of the device, the back panel plays with light and shadows. Alongside the classic Midnight Black version, the ‘Breathing Crystal’ design is inspired by the ethereal visuals of salt flats, capturing the dreamy effects and engraves them on the back of a smartphone.
HUAWEI Y9s uses a glass-made back panel to fully exploit the charms of craftsmanship and aesthetics. The dazzling back panel is crafted with nano-texture process (Breathing Crystal only) and has a 21-layer glass polishing process. In addition, the 3D Arc designed middle frame create a natural and streamlined transition from the back panel to the front display while providing a more comfortable grip.
The HUAWEI Y9s also adopts a side-fingerprint design, which combines the power and fingerprint unlock button in one. This feature ensures the integrity of the front and back panels, allowing users to use one button for multiple purposes.
6.59-Inch FullView Display Unveils A Boundary-Free World
The device sports a 6.59-inch LCD display (2340×1080) that brings out the fine details and makes on-screen colours look more vibrant. Together with a micro-seam earpiece embedded into the top bezel and an ambient light sensor installed at the bottom, the front pop-up camera allows the display to have even thinner bezels while retaining the integrity of the display. Additionally, the HUAWEI Y9s has a high screen-to-body ratio with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, maximizing the viewing area. When the screen is on, it offers a clear, clean and unobstructed view. When the screen is off, both top and bottom bezels “disappear”, looking like a boundary-free black mirror.
In addition, the HUAWEI Y9s features the TÜV Rheinland low blue light certified Eye Comfort Mode. With the help of Huawei’s sunlight display and video display enhancement technologies, the device can intelligently adjust screen brightness based on the ambient lighting to deliver the most comfortable viewing experience.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Airtel Launches No-expiry Data and Voice Bundles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Airtel Kenya on Monday, December 9, launched no expiry data and call rates that will allow customers to spend as low as 1 bob for 5MB data and to make calls at 2bob across all networks.
At the same time, the company also revamped its entire Amazing data bundle offerings to give more data for the same cost as before e.g. 3GB for Kshs300 up from 1.5GB, 5GB for Kshs500 up from 4GB and 12GB for Kshs1000 up from 10GB with 30days validity.
The new offerings are targeted towards customers who are looking to meet their communication needs with ease and not worry about any hidden costs or conditions. To active the new rates, customers need to dial *544*2#.
The new products campaign dubbed ‘BeSureNaAirtel’ is pegged on showing customers the exact rates and value they get for their investment. The new offers have no hidden charges or conditions for use, thus customers are assured of getting what they pay for at the most competitive rates.
Speaking at the launch event, Airtel’s Managing Director, Prasanta Das Sarma stated, "We are pleased to introduce the industry’s best no expiry rates for data and voice to all our customers. We have also revamped our Amazing data bundles to cater for our heavy data users, by offering up to 100% more data."
"These new offerings are based on emerging consumer insights and trends that show a substantial increase in data usage for both social and business needs as well as the need for customers to not worry about the cost of data while browsing," he stated.
He expressed his confidence that the new rates and revamped bundles will meet all the communication needs of Airtel’s customers even with as low airtime balance as Kshs1.
Airtel continues to invest in the business to bring more innovative products and services and enhance its network coverage.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We're just a day away from the end of support of Windows 10 Mobile, and this time it will be dead for good. In a new support document, Microsoft also announced the end of life date for the Office apps on the mobile OS, and those won't be supported after January 12, 2021.
Throughout the following year, Microsoft will be shipping bug fixes, security fixes, and technical support for issues, and that's it. Don't expect to see any new features during this time.
The apps in question here are the Office UWP apps. The wording of the blog post is a bit ambiguous, in fact, as it's not exactly clear if the apps themselves are being killed off, or if they just won't be supported on Microsoft's unsupported mobile OS. The document says, "On that date, app users will no longer receive security updates, non-security hotfixes, free assisted support options or online technical content updates from Microsoft."
Microsoft's Office UWP apps were never very widely available outside of phones, and being that operating systems like Windows 10X will support containerized Win32 apps, they don't really have a place elsewhere anymore. Naturally, we've reached out to Microsoft for clarification on this matter.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA -- Canadian providers of Internet-based phone systems should be able to adopt new technology next year that goes after fake phone calls.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission says telecom companies should be able to implement systems by Sept. 30, 2020 that will help consumers using IP-based phone systems verify whether incoming calls are from legitimate people, businesses or government agencies.
The regulator says the new technology is already used in parts of the United States.
The impact for many Canadians will be limited because the technology isn't available for traditional land-lines or mobile phones.
The regulator says about 40 per cent of the complaints it receives each year are about caller ID spoofing, which allows callers to hide their real number by displaying a fake one on the receiving phone.
The Canadian Anti Fraud Centre estimates Canadians have lost millions of dollars to scams artists who use computer programs to spoof legitimate telephone numbers, including numbers used by the Canada Revenue Agency, Service Canada and even local police.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 9, 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">E-scooter company Unicorn goes bust after spending big on Facebook ads</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Electric scooter start-up Unicorn is shutting down after spending too much money on Facebook adverts.
Customers received an email from founder Nick Evans, saying he was "very sorry" and was trying to sell Unicorn's assets to offer partial refunds.
The Texas-based company sold just 350 of its $699 (£531) commuter scooters, according to The Verge. They have a top speed of 15mph and a range of 15 miles.
And start-up tracker Crunchbase said Unicorn had raised just $150,000.
"It saddens me to write this letter but we have run out of funding and are shutting down operations immediately," the email says.
"We unfortunately do not have the resources to deliver your Unicorns nor are we able to provide refunds, as we are completely out of funding."
The cost of "Facebook and Google ads, payments for loans, and other expenses" ate through the company's funding quicker than Mr Evans anticipated.
"A large proportion of the revenue went toward paying for Facebook ads to bring traffic to the site," the email says.
"Unfortunately the cost of the ads were just too expensive to build a sustainable business."
"This is infuriating and I am not happy with this company," customer Juliette Lopez wrote on Facebook.
And Rebecca Buchholtz wrote she was "heartbroken" after receiving the email as she had ordered her daughter a scooter for Christmas
The company has not posted on Facebook or Instagram since 20 June.
However, four weeks ago it wrote on its website it was on track to ship scooters on 15 December, adding customers would have their orders in time for Christmas and Hanukkah.
Though popular around the world, electric scooters are illegal to use on UK roads and pavements.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Confirming leaks from last week, Sega has announced a that will deliver enhanced versions of the two action games for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The bundle will ship on February 18, 2020, with digital and physical editions available.
The PlatinumGames-developed titles will come remastered to run at 4K resolution and 60FPS on both the Xbox One X and the PlayStation 4 Pro systems. Sega hasn't revealed how well will the titles perform on the standard editions of the consoles.
The physical release will arrive in a SteelBook case that will come featuring new cover art "produced by Weapons Van, supervised by Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya and Sega." It appears a PC version is not in the works. However, since the games' relatively recently released PC editions already feature the high FPS and resolution enhancements, this is to be expected.
The Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle comes in at $39.99 and pre-purchasing options for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 can be found on the official landing page set up by Sega.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Events can now be moved between calendars using the Google Calendar app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Calendar is adding the ability to move events between different calendars in a server-side update. Before this, moving events could only be done through the web app where users were able to migrate events between the added accounts. If users wanted to move events using the mobile app, they had to copy or duplicate event details to the other calendar and delete the original event later.
This feature can be accessed by clicking on a new option that appears below the appointment title in the app. Once selected, events can be moved to any accounts currently signed in on users' devices. The screenshots below show the steps involved in moving events between calendars.
As per folks over at Android Police, this feature can be forced to show up by force quitting the Calendar app and clearing its cache. Since this appears to be a server-side update, it does not require updating the app.

Internet access is available everywhere in the US, but not all connections are created equal. Ookla has used data from its popular Speedtest app to highlight the areas where consumers are stuck with Satellite internet. These satellite-heavy ZIP codes cover a surprising amount of the country, but there are fewer people living there than you’d think. 
Satellite internet has been available to consumers since the early 90s. In those days, the experience wasn’t vastly different than sluggish wired dial-up internet. Today, Satellite internet is at a severe disadvantage when it comes to speed and reliability. Even the newer generation of Ku band signals capable of delivering multi-megabit speeds are far behind even modest wireline broadband connections. 
The Ookla data is organized by ZIP codes — those colored blue have at least 20 percent satellite internet usage among Speedtest users. That indicates an area has very poor broadband infrastructure. Of course, people only put up with satellite internet when they have no other option. It’s slower than wired connections, and the data caps are vastly more oppressive. HughesNet offers 25Mbps downloads, but the data cap could be as low as 20GB, depending on your plan. Cross the limit, and your speeds drop to sub-broadband. These people risk being left behind as the internet evolves to rely on faster connections. 
The blue blobs cover a lot of the country, but Ookla says there are only 2.22 million people living in those ZIP codes. For example, the large blue patch in west Texas has only 118 residents. Rolling out fiber or cable is expensive, and companies don’t have any incentive to do it in sparsely populated areas. Some rural communities do have DSL connections, but these are slower than cable internet. In many places, DSL tops out at 10Mbps, which can be alright for basic tasks on a single device. You have to feel bad for anyone trying to share that connection among multiple devices, though. 
Mobile carriers have paid lip-service to using 4G LTE as a home internet option, but the data caps and speeds are still too low. 5G might provide an alternative in the future, but there’s still a lot of infrastructure waiting to be deployed. Perhaps a new generation of satellite internet could solve the problem. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is deploying the Starlink satellite system, hoping to provide fast, low-latency internet to wide swaths of the globe. As with 5G, it’s too early to know if Starlink will appreciably boost rural internet speeds.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Amna Khan
A girl sipping her tea on a rooftop covered with fairy lights, staring romantically into the skyline describes the ‘Sooper’ cookies advert that really took me back to simpler times. No forced use of technology, hyperactive communication, obnoxious use of jingles or pressure for consumption- just simplicity at its best. I can’t even remember the last time a smile came to my lips from watching a TV ad. Funny story; I recreated a replica of this moment on my rooftop that very night reminiscing about the ‘simplest’ of times.
Times unpunctuated by consumption fever where family, success and wealth were not symbolised by cooking oil, washing powders and fairness creams. Times when television programmes were less frequently interrupted by advertising entities; those bearing the heavy costs of their production. It was the simplest of times really, when one could be fooled into believing that all is good in the world and will remain so, indefinitely. The absence of black screens both big and small from our lives best explain the power they wield in the present world. ‘Fifteen Million Merits’ an episode of Black Mirror explains it like no other, your attention, your thoughts, every kilojoule of energy you spend in your waking hours is not free. You pay for it by the price of interruption, because your mind is worth much more than any perceivable amount you could pay to skip that YouTube ad altogether.
Our attention is priceless and the best time for an ad to take the value of our time without our consent is when we’re immersed in an absorbing TV show. Ads can be a boon or bane depending on whether it’s time for you to take a bathroom break. However, the kaleidoscopic proportions at which today’s ad’s function is undoubtedly the reason why people stopped watching TV altogether and this gave way to internet television.
Eventually streaming services will outmanoeuvre broadcast mediums because of their ability to choke off advertising & create captivating programming to retain a loyal viewership. Brands recognise the power of social media and are shrewdly switching the bulk of their ad revenue to Facebook and Instagram. It could be how the audiences who enjoy broadcast are simply too old and unfazed by the appeal of making purchases or that their children seem too distracted by Instagram to watch what’s happening on the TV playing in front of them. Or maybe it’s the convenience of redirecting our attention with the tap of a finger to the e-commerce website that just showed you the pants you said you were just looking for. Most likely it seems it’s the simple fact of brands saving money by targeting only people with disposable income to spend and owning a smartphone is the bare minimum to qualify as a prospective customer with purchasing potential.
The biggest benefit of the advertising supported revenue model of social media platforms is that if you have an audience, you can almost always find companies who are willing to pay to reach them. However, attracting users by free content, tailor made in accordance with their tastes, might only continue to work for such entities. The redundancy of Pakistani broadcast viewership coupled with the harsh reality of Instagram itself being the means to an end is something we don’t consciously consider. Every online business model assumes the ‘online’ aspect a permanent arrangement.
If Instagram goes down, we all go down with it. However we presume it is flawless, even some would say infallible. Where ‘advertising’ for Silicon Valley based companies is a means to hypnotise users into staying logged in, Pakistan’s cringe inducing ads rationalise the existence of complacent programming. Airing lousy drama’s doesn’t really matter because producers are already getting paid by advertisers so why bother with quality control? Successful media entities prefer multiple revenue streams to avoid financial collapse. Advertising revenues are unreliable. Advertisers can detract their investments considering the plethora of devices and channels people consume content from in today’s media ecosystem. Engagement with ad supported content has become a liability where it had been used as a means of survival for so long in Pakistani media- it can’t be used as a crutch anymore. When the technology used 20 years ago is outdated, how can we expect the media to survive on principles equally as old?
For streaming services like Netflix, Amazon & HBO, the brand itself is the ad that prompts people for further consumption. Subscription rates is what quantifies a time well spent, respecting customers for the value of their money is company policy. Where at present there is trouble in breaking even for some of these companies, the long-term plans are set in motion. Imitating the Chinese policy of patiently bearing losses in the short term for long term results. The Chinese outbid the market on manufactured goods by selling below market price for several years before successfully becoming an economic global power. Similarly, Netflix seems to be paying the price of future excellence in present losses. That’s the ‘Catch 22’ to succeeding in the media industry; the considerable degree of cultural clout it yields is not translated in how much we the consumer spend to access it. Then again, I guess that’s what simpler times are really supposed to exemplify – authentic and honest programming devoid of disruptions, free of cost, without repercussions. Skip Ad in 3… 2… 1.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now we are in the most expensive period of the year, chances are you are whipping your credit or debit card out more often than you'd like.
And now some new changes are coming into place that mean shopping could be about to become even more stressful.
The new rules mean your card will automatically decline if you use contactless to pay for items more than five times in a row, and it doesn't matter how small your transactions are.
This will mean you'll need to use the chip and pin machine to prove you are the card owner.
Your card will also stop working contactlessly if you spend more than £137 - even if you do so in less than five transactions.
Shoppers using their cards in 'unusual' locations are also more likely to have their cards blocked.
It's better news for people who use Google or Apple pay, though, as the new rules don't apply to these, so you can carry on using them like you usually would.
Online shoppers will also face some changes, as text authentication is being phased in to prove it's really you buying things.
The changes have already started to come into place, and by March 2021 all retailers will be required to do this as standard during the checkout process.

Christo Georgiev, chief executive of UK payment solutions company myPOS, says shoppers should have their PIN handy while buying things - even if they don't cost much.
He warned consumers: "You shouldn’t panic when your card is declined once the limit has been reached, just continue using your card but make sure you can enter your PIN to complete the transaction."

    <h5 class="mb-1">GOG's Galaxy 2.0 launcher is now, at long last, in open beta</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A couple of days ago, Galaxy 2.0, GOG's upcoming hub type launcher, got a closed beta update and now, it has reached the open beta phase. You can see a small feature overview above.
As a reminder for those who haven't followed the development too close, the folks at GOG announced their plans for the new launcher in May, launcher which entered an invite-based closed beta a month later.
In July, it received its first relatively major content patch, version 2.0.3 or the Nyx Update. Keeping the space theme, September's Atlas Update (v2.0.5) added a slew of features like global search, expansive customization features for your library, and much more. November saw the release of the Euporie Update (v2.0.9) with its support for mouse shortcuts (on Windows), duplicate game stacking, searching for community integrations, and access to GOG game extras.
Finally, the Argus Update (v2.0.10/2.0.11) that made its way to folks on December 7 added the ability to see your friends' activity across connected platforms via a new dedicated sidebar, as well as to share your stats - like number of owned games, achievements, and so on - to social media. Feel free to check all of the linked updates for our in-depth looks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hearables fuel wearable shipment surge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The growing popularity of wireless ear and headphones pushed wearable shipments in the third quarter up 94.6 per cent year-on-year, IDC figures showed.
IDC classes wireless earphones as hearables, noting these accounted for almost half the 84.5 million wearable units shipped during the quarter. A total of 40.7 million hearables were moved in the period, compared with 11.9 million in Q3 2018, fuelled by products including Apple Air Pods, Beats headphones and Samsung Galaxy Buds.
Wristbands accounted for 19.2 million of the Q3 total, up 48.6 per cent, with smartwatch shipments of 17.6 million 48 per cent higher.
Apple was the leading vendor, with 29.5 million wearables shipped, up 195.5 per cent, followed by Xiaomi on shipments of 12.4 million, up 66.1 per cent. IDC noted the vendor’s Mi Band accounted for 10 million of its total units.
Samsung ranked third with 8.3 million units shipped a 156.4 per cent increase; Huawei came fourth with shipments of 7.1 million up 202.6  per cent, and Fitbit rounded out the top five, with 3.5 million units up by less than 1 per cent.
Ramon Llamas, research director, said “hearables have become the new go-to product for the wearables market” as more smartphone manufacturers removed headphone jacks, driving consumers towards wireless headphones.
Research manager Jitesh Ubrani added: “The rise of smart assistants in the home and on the phone has led to an increased demand for wearables that have the ability to connect with these assistants.”
“With multiple form factors and the inclusion of smart assistants, the wearables market is well on its way to becoming a mass-market device category rather than one that primarily caters to health and fitness.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Redmi 8A review: Going top class on a budget</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the past several years, Redmi A series has been besting selling phones for Xiaomi and has helped the company maintain a healthy lead over the rivals in terms of market share.
Now, the company has come up with the new Redmi 8A and it boasts truckload of upgrades over the popular Redmi 7A and costs under Rs 7,000.
We got the opportunity to try out the Xiaomi’s new budget mobile and here are our thoughts about it.
Design, display and build quality:
Though Redmi 8A is one of the cheapest smartphones in the market, Xiaomi looks really good. The ergonomic Aura Wave design is not only visually appealing but also the shell’s texture, which resembles a finger’s friction ridges, offer a solid grip. Thanks to the colour choice, there is less chance of sweaty fingerprint smudges. 
The material used on the rear-side offers good solid and premium hand-feel. It can survive accidental falls from small heights. The Redmi 8A boasts P2i nano-coating, which protects the device from water splashes or rain.
On the front, it sports a 6.1-inch HD+ dot-notch display with a 19:9 aspect ratio. I did not face any trouble watching multimedia content, browsing the web and never had to squint my eyes to read messages on the screen.
Performance:
Xiaomi Redmi 8A houses a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 octa-core chipset backed by Android Pie-based MIUI 10 OS, 2GB/3GB RAM and 32GB storage, which can be expanded up to 512GB via microSD card.
The device fares well in terms of performing day-to-day tasks such as calling, messaging, web browsing, viewing videos on the web, switch between multiple apps and so on. You can play generic games such as Candy Crush, Temple Run and Angry Birds, but it is unlikely to show the same robustness when playing graphics-rich games such as PUBG or Asphalt gaming titles.
Recently, Redmi 8A received the latest MIUI 11 software update with the latest November Google security patch. It makes the phone perform fast and brings lots of new theme packs in terms of wallpapers, ringtones and more.
Though, the MIUI is one of the best third-party Android UI for mobiles in the industry, the annoying ads from the pre-loaded company’s proprietary apps are a bit jarring
Camera:
Xiaomi Redmi 8A sports a 12MP primary sensor with Sony IMX363 sensor, f/1.8 aperture and LED flash on the back. It takes really good pictures under natural light conditions. The images taken in portrait mode and HDR are top class. Even in the night, the camera captures really rich details of the subject.
On the front, the Redmi 8A comes with an 8MP camera.  It also boasts Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Portrait mode, beautifies app and other selfie-centric filters. 
During the tests, it took pretty decent selfies and the pictures with the Bokeh effect are really good compared to the rivals in the sub Rs 8,000 categories.
Battery:
Xiaomi’s Redmi 8A comes with a massive 5,000mAh battery and supports Type C-based 10W charger. No other rival offers these latest USB ports in its class.
As far as battery life concerned, Xiaomi Redmi 8A can easily last a full day with extreme usage including binge-watching videos, browse social media apps for hours, extended gameplay, take photos and videos. If used more conservatively, the phone can serve you for two days.
Final thoughts:
Given the cost constraints, most of the OEMs cut corners to assemble a budget phone. But, Xiaomi has for long bucked the trend and its stupendous success in India is proof for everyone to see. 
Now, with the Redmi 8A, Xiaomi has once again set a new benchmark in the sub Rs 7,000 category. It boasts Type C USB port, 5,000mAh battery, sturdy build quality, top-notch primary camera (with IMX363 sensor, f/1.8 aperture), nano-coating for water splash resistant and can be bought at affordable price.
If you are in the market looking for a cost-effective budget phone, go for the Redmi 8A.

In our busy schedules and fixed routines, vehicles such as cars and bikes have become an essential part of our lives. Whether you use a bike or a car, it is extremely important to always secure your journey with valid vehicle insurance, also because it is mandatory in India as per the Indian Motor Vehicles Act.

When you buy a car or a bike, you generally get two keys. In case of theft, when it is already hard to get your stolen vehicle back, you might also not get the required financial assistance through the claim if one of your vehicle keys is lost or has been misplaced. In such a case, you claim will be rejected, something that not many in India are aware of.
Hence, to avoid such a situation, you must carry both keys and present it to the insurer whenever they ask for it.
Why do insurance companies ask for both keys?
Basically, insurance companies design motor insurance plans to cover theft, not negligence. In the case of owner leaving one of the keys in the vehicle, it will be considered as the owner's negligence if the vehicle is stolen. If you provide both keys, that's proof that the theft didn't take place because of your negligence. Moreover, it also proves that you don't intend to defraud the insurance company.
Don't try to submit duplicate keys or key of any other vehicle of the same model
What will you do if you don't have both keys with you? In such a case, people normally think of submitting duplicate keys or keys of any other vehicle of the same model to get his/her claim approved.
Normally, for a specific vehicle brand/model, the keys looks identical. In such a case, how will the insurance company check that the submitted keys are of the stolen car or not?
Usually, the theft cases are analyzed on the basis of several factors that include situations, verbal and written narrations, police reports, investigations, etc. The keys that you will submit for the claim will be checked basis the usage of the vehicle and against the declarations/narrations and revelations that you made initially.
Further, policy reports and findings will be used to evaluate the whole case and will be compared with the declarations of the insured.
Hence, it is vital to understand that you must not submit duplicate keys or fake keys to get your claim approved. For example, if the police finds your vehicle and insurance company finds out that the keys submitted by you are unable to unlock the vehicle, you might get into trouble for submitting the wrong keys to the insurer.
What's the best that can you can do?
Normally, you use only one key of your vehicle and use the second one only when the first one gets damaged or worn out.
Also, here are some tips that might help.
1. When one of your keys is worn out, you must not throw it. Just keep it safely with you as having both keys at the time of the claim will make your case stronger and there will be nominal chances of a rejection.
2. Opt for a key replacement insurance rider with your bike insurance or car insurance. This will help you get the keys at the right time and your case will be easier to describe to the insurer.
Ace cricketer Virender Sehwag says, "If you own a key replacement rider, the insurance company is bound to provide the replacement cost or will get the key replacement done for you. This way, you can get the keys whenever it's required. Don't fall in the trap of frauds and choose the best one wisely."
Also, do not forget to choose the right platform such as PolicyX.com to choose the insurance plan most appropriate for your vehicle.
The Bottom Line
When it comes to lost keys, you should inform the police and get an FIR done right away. Also, inform your insurance company about the same before going for duplicate keys. Moreover, at the time of the claim, apart from submitting both the keys to the insurance company, you must keep insurance policy details, vehicle details, and a copy of the FIR with you. Never ever go for duplicate keys and keep a key replacement rider with you to avoid unwanted situations and claim rejections.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mojang took to the PlayStation Blog today to officially announce Bedrock is finally coming to the PlayStation 4 tomorrow, December 10, just as recent leaks had predicted. The game that's currently available on the Sony console will be getting the new version as an update, bumping it up to version 1.14, which is the upcoming Buzzy Bees release.
Alongside feature parity with all other versions, the biggest new addition that Bedrock brings to the PlayStation 4 is cross-play support. Now, PlayStation 4 players will all be able to play together with Windows 10, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, mobile, and other version players - who are also on update 1.14 - in the same multiplayer servers.
Access to Minecraft Marketplace is incoming too, letting PlayStation players purchase worlds, skins, mash-up packs, and more through the in-game store. See the new cross-play showcase Better Together trailer above.
Since this will be delivered as an update tomorrow, slated to land at 8AM PST, all existing owners will be upgraded to the new version without needing to purchase anything. Anyone purchasing a new copy of Minecraft on PlayStation 4 will also be jumping into the Bedrock version from the start.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp broadens call waiting option to Android</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WhatsApp reportedly extended a call waiting feature to Android devices, a little more than a week after offering the option to those on iOS smartphones, in response to user requests.
In an update, the company added the option for users to be informed of incoming calls while already using WhatsApp to talk, enabling them to stay on the current call or end it in favour of the new one.
Previously incoming calls were automatically rejected if a user was already using the app to speak.
WhatsApp enabled the function for iOS users at end-November, with Android now added as part of a broader update of the app currently being deployed.
Privacy changes are also incorporated in the updgrade, including the ability for users to control who can add them a group chat, along with the introduction of biometric security to open the app.
Voice calls were introduced in WhatsApp in February 2015, followed by a video calling feature in November 2016. In July 2018, the company announced users spent more than 2 billion minutes on voice and video calls per day.
Last month, WhatsApp was upgraded with a feature enabling businesses to create new product catalogue pages.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What is VPN Good For And The Top 5 Best VPN Services</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VPN or virtual private network is an online connection process that is used to improve the security and privacy of users. Whether you use a private or public network, there is always a chance that you might get hacked. Sure, there are plenty of online security tools that claim to protect you but not all of them work effectively. Even if you have them, a single moment of negligence added with terrible luck can lead to you losing all your stored private information.
VPNs were used profusely by corporations to protect their sensitive data but today it has become an essential tool for both companies and private individuals to protect themselves online. Technology is always a double-edged sword as it is available to everyone. It can be used for good or bad depending on the purpose of the individual controlling it. Just as more and more online security tools pop up, the number of ways in which hackers can break through the digital walls also increases. So maybe instead of building a wall, we should just pretend that we’re somewhere where we are not and that is exactly what VPN does.
The genius of the VPN is in its simplicity. Rather than fighting against external threats, it diverts your network location away from your local address. A VPN tool basically takes your initial IP address and replaces it with another making it near impossible for others to track you online. For instance, if you live in New York, you can use a VPN to make it appear that you are browsing from Berlin. It essentially creates a private online connection between a user and their device making it impossible for prying eyes to see where and what you are doing.
To be more specific about the way VPN helps you, here are some of the things it does.
It Hides Your IP Address
It Changes Your IP Address
It Encrypts Your Data Transfers
It Hides Your Location
It Gives You Access To Blocked Websites
In order to understand something fully; you need to know about its past and its original purpose. Ever since the internet took the world by storm, there has been a need for more secure data transfers. VPN first came into being as an extension of peer-to-peer tunneling protocol or PPTP in 1996 when an employee working at Microsoft developed the latter method. Anti-virus software began to flood the market as a way of protecting oneself online but it was only effective at the end-user level. There was a need for a way to secure the connection itself instead of a defensive mechanism and that is how VPN came into being.
In the beginning, VPNs were almost exclusively used by businesses as they required secure connections for protecting extremely sensitive data. However, by the 2000s, a series of cyber-attacks swept all across the world providing the need for VPNs to become more accessible. In the last two decades, several companies have brought out VPN tools to the market and some of them have been very effective at preventing online attacks.
You might think that the VPN is only for securing yourself online but it is so much more than that. It can also help you bypass otherwise inaccessible avenues. For instance, if certain sites are banned in certain countries, then by using a VPN a user can gain access to it by changing their online location. VPN played a crucial role in the recent freedom struggle in Egypt when the former government tried banning social media sites to stop the news about the revolution from spreading all over the world. By using VPN, several activists and journalists were able to cover the whole event and show them to the world. People from all over the world were communicating with those struggling in Egypt to help the latter in any way they can.
Another reason to use a VPN is not just to safeguard yourself against bad actors but also from your own government. From numerous leaked documents by Wiki Leaks and individuals like Edward Snowden, the world came to know about several top-secret ways in which the government was trying to spy on its own people. While there might be a semblance of reason in such a tactic, it is highly intrusive. VPN can help you to be invisible online and also unlock geo-restricted online content such as YouTube, NetFlix, Hulu, etc.
As mentioned above, there are numerous reasons why you should get a VPN. But how do you find an effective VPN service that actually works? Here are some of the top VPN services in the world according to users and everything you need to know about them.
 
ExpressVPN is easily one of the top three VPN services available in the market today. It offers a whopping 148 locations across 94 countries along with several unique features to assist you on mobile and desktops alike. The product is available for several platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linus, iOS, Android and even Blackberry (limited models).
Unlike other VPNs, they add routers, offer browser extensions and unblock DNS content for numerous devices and even Smart TVs. They provide extensions for some of the most popular online browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc, which allows you to switch locations and servers whenever you surf the internet. Moreover, ExpressVPN also supports Amazon Fire TV and Android TV.

You also get P2P support and a kill switch which allows you to stay hidden if your network ever drops. Another interesting aspect of ExpressVPN is their privacy policy. A lot of other service providers word their privacy policy in a very vague way. You don’t get that with Express VPN. They very clearly state that they do not collect logs of your activity including your browsing history.

Final Verdict
If you are looking for an all-round and fast VPN service at a decent price, then ExpressVPN is the service to go for hands down.
 
NordVPN is a company based in Panama with over 1 million customers from all over the world. It provides over 4050 servers across 60 locations and allows you to have 6 simultaneous connections. Where NordVPN stands apart from the competition is in its features. They are available on a variety of platforms such as Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android and come with a kill switch as well as a DNS leak blocking.
Performance-wise, you get very good speeds and everything runs like a well-oiled machine. One great aspect of NordVPN is that it has a connection wizard that can help you to set up the connection based on your browsing needs ranging from P2P, security, streaming or just being anonymous online. As far as security is concerned, their Onion over NordVPN solution is perfect for shielding you from prying eyes by routing your traffic through the VPN server and then the Onion router.

Unlike other VPN services, they keep everything clear, concise and up to the point making it easy to go through the whole content.
You can get a 3 day trial for new users but strangely they don’t mention that on their website. You can purchase the VPN by choosing the package of your preference.

Price
As far as the pricing is concerned, their 2-year subscription plan is an absolute steal at $79 being billed every 2 years. Their single month charges might be a bit high but the 2-year plan is just golden. You also get a 30-day money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their services.
Final Verdict
NordVPN is easy to use, affordable and reliable VPN service that provides great performance and good speeds. The client for Windows does have a few kinks to it but overall the product provides enough upside that you can forgive its minor issues.
With a name like VyprVPN you know they are not to be messed with and after using the product, it sure is true. It has over 700 servers across 73 locations supporting over 200,000 IP addresses which are impressive numbers. Based in Switzerland, VyprVPN has certain strategic location-based advantages that its competitors don’t have. Switzerland is very favorable towards privacy policies in general and doesn’t meddle too much into other people’s private information.
What’s sets Vypr apart from the others is easily their performance which is extraordinarily fast. Moreover, they also provide some cool features such as auto-connect which enables you to automatically connect to a selected location, a kill switch and better security via their proprietary Chameleon protocol and VyprDNS.
As far as compatible platforms go, VyprVPN is available for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux and smart Tvs. While standard members get to have 3 simultaneous connections going, premium users can run up to 5 connections. As far as their privacy policy is concerned, they state their points very clearly. In this service, there is some session logging but it is explained well and in enough detail to grasp their purpose which does seem very fair.

VyprVPN offers a standard and a premium plan with each having two options of paying month by month or a discounted annual option. Premium users also enjoy additional features such as access to VyprVPN Cloud and Chameleon Protocol.

Final Verdict
It’s not the most affordable service but VyprVPN is a beast of a VPN. It is fast and very powerful but they do have session logging so you have to choose whether that is worth the great speed and performance you get from them.

TunnelBear is easily the easiest VPN product to navigate through and use without a shred of a doubt. This is certainly a very interesting service as there are many others who have more servers and locations but the simplicity of the product makes it actually better to have in some regard. TunnelBear VPN is a Canadian based service that has over 1000 servers and 20 plus server locations with the ability to support 5 devices.
What’s pretty amazing about this service is their sense of clarity and their absolute disdain of unnecessary jargon. If you opt for most VPN service providers available, you will get absolutely confused at the way the tool is presented to you especially if you are someone new to VPN. Everything from the interface design to the layout and FAQs are made terribly confusing in most products. In TunnelBear you get exactly what you need to know in the simplest terms. It’s perfect for fathers and mothers who grew up before the dawn of the internet because it disseminates the information in the best possible way.
While the performance is impressively high locally, the speed does drop down a little when trying long-distance connections but this is something that most VPNs suffer from to be honest. Where this service stands apart is that it’s a free service to use but you get only limited data of 500 MB per month. You can get higher data usage by going for a premium plan. They don’t record any logging activity as mentioned in their privacy policy which is as transparent as they come.

Hotspot Shield has over 2500 servers across 25 locations and at one point of time, it offered the greatest value due to their extremely low pricing. Over time they made changes to the amounts they charge but they still are extremely affordable for all the features you get with it and the lightning-fast download speeds. You also get a separate service called Hotspot Shield Business which is catered towards businesses and corporations more than private individuals. You can get it for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS platforms and although they used to support kindle, that is no longer the case.
As far as their privacy policy is concerned, while they do a good enough job explaining what they do and the reason why there is a tremendous amount of content you have to go through to read it all. Everything is expanded to such great lengths that you cannot find a single blanket statement. This might be ok for the average user but for the experienced VPN user, it may put off some because they usually want to know what exactly they are getting when they opt for such services.
In terms of sheer performance, Hotspot Shield provides amazing download speeds for their price point. You will have no problem streaming content through popular services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Use Cloudflare’s New VPN Service On Android</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The online world around us is not as private as it appears. Tech companies like Microsoft and Google log our browsing data to show us relevant ads. Everything you do on the internet is somehow tracked. To deal with such issues, security researchers often recommends the use of Private Browsers or VPN Apps.
To make your browsing session secure and private, one needs to use a VPN service. Now, if we talk about the VPN, everyone wants to get a fast, secure, and free VPN. Although its a challenge to get all three things in just one service, still lots of companies were trying their luck to fulfil the needs of users.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vivo U20 launch date, specs, price, review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vivo U20 may just be the phone you need. It offers a lot of amazing features, especially those linked to connectivity. You can access both 3G and 4G, not to mention the phone's GPS Bluetooth capabilities. The device is fairly priced and comes with enough storage for your media files.
The Vivo U20 launch date was November 2019. This means that the Chinese company launched the 4 GB and 6 GB RAM models of this device a few weeks ago. Another version, the 8 GB RAM one, is said to be launched on 12th December. The current Vivo U20 price is approximately Rs. 10990.
The device has a couple of things to offer. However, it also comes with its downsides. Check out the phone's pros and cons below before making a decision.
Before buying the Vivo U20 mobile, you need to be aware of what specs it comes with. It is only by understanding the basics that you can make an informed decision. Here are Vivo U20 all details.
The following are the hardware components that make the phone stand out.
The upgrades on this phone give it a sleek look. The phone's design is generally shiny, thanks to its plastic back panel as well as the frame that give it a glossy finish. While it comes in two colours, a black and blue shade, the choice one makes is purely banked on their preference.
Its power and volume buttons are found on the right. The SIM tray is on the left whereas its 3.5 mm jack, the charging port as well as speaker grille are located at its bottom. With a weight of approximately 193 grams, some people may conclude that it is a bulky and heavy device.
It has a back fingerprint scanner that works well. However, one needs to stretch to get to it. The triple rear camera module with a protective covering is housed by the back panel.
The phone has a screen-to-body ratio of 84.4%. It has thin bezels because of the waterdrop notch for the front camera. It has a 6.53-inch IPS LCD panel that is bright from all angles. It also comes with a full-HD+ panel, which is an upgrade on its display.
The phone uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor coupled with 6GB/4GB RAM. Both variants of the phone come with a ROM of 64GB, which is quite sufficient for ordinary use. If you need more space, then you can bank on the card slot.
Gamers can rest easy knowing that they can enjoy smooth multi-tasking. However, you have to be okay with the fact that the phone will get hot with prolonged use.
The device includes an Ultra Game mode which include features such as off-screen Autoplay. This means that you can have a game running even when the display is switched off. You also have the option of blocking notifications. You also do not have to worry about answering your call when in this mode. You can use the free hand mode to receive calls and reduce interruptions.
One of the biggest highlights of this phone is its 5,000mAh battery. It comes boxed with an 18W Dual-Engine fast charger. This guarantees you 30 to 36 hours when used on medium to high. Even if you exhaust your battery life, you can be consoled by the fact that the phone charges pretty fast too.
The phone has a loudspeaker together with a 3.5mm headphone jack complete with the active noise cancellation with dedicated mic feature.
Software components determine how great a phone is in terms of functionality. Here are the most crucial ones for the Vivo U20.
The phone runs on a Funtouch OS 9.2 on top of the Android 9 Pie. It also has a couple of pre-installed apps that may be considered bloatware. Seeing that this is not the usual OS most users are accustomed to, it is possible that they experience some difficulties at first. Some of the common apps to expect include EasyShare, Gaana, GameCenter, Amazon Shopping, Dailyhunt, Opera and Helo among others. Not to worry though, you can always uninstall the ones you do not need to minimize the number of notifications you get.
As usual, the manufacturer did not slack off when it comes to camera quality. The device has a triple rear camera consisting of one 16-megapixel primary camera. It has a Sony IMX499 sensor. The device also has a second camera, an 8-megapixel super-wide-angle camera, as well as a third one which is a 2-megapixel macro camera, used to take large images. The selfie camera is a 16MP single camera.
Users of the device already have positive remarks about it. Here are a few sampled views from YouTube.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Huawei announces that more devices will get HarmonyOS in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Huawei has announced that it will be shipping more devices next year powered by its Android alternative, HarmonyOS. The firm said that products will not be limited to China, but will also come to stores around the world. One such product that could be included in the product line-up includes the previously announced Huawei Vision, a 4K Quantum Dot smart TV.
While HarmonyOS was touted as a rival to Android, the Chinese firm isn’t planning to bring HarmonyOS to Android’s biggest domain – smartphones & tablets – just yet. Rather than jump right into the smartphone market, the firm plans to roll out its OS to more peripheral tech such as smartwatches, speakers, virtual reality technology, and TVs.
The comments that were cited by Reuters were made by the president of the Huawei consumer business group’s software division, Wang Chenglu. He re-iterated the fact that the firm did not want to drop Android from its phones. The firm likely wants to stick with Android because it’ll be more appealing to customers, with that said, the firm does plan to include support for Android apps on HarmonyOS sometime in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Hour of Code' Demystifies Computer Programming for Kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Advertisement
From banking to basic communication, computers wind their way through virtually every aspect of our modern lives. But in the United States, most schools don't teach fundamental computer science, even at a time when demand for computer-savvy professionals far outstrips supply. This educational deficiency leaves kids completely clueless about how their own digital devices (which they're often glued to) work.
That glaring gap inspired the project Hour of Code. Hour of Code (offered by the nonprofit Code.org) gives children a peek into the world of coding through easy, fun coding tasks, which expose them to the problem-solving skills and limitless potential of computer programming. Activities are designed to be completed within an hour, though, of course, a student can go on to perform multiple tasks.
The first Hour of Code event happened during Computer Science Education Week in December 2013, the brainchild of Iranian-American brothers Hadi Partovi and Ali Partovi, who decided that someone needed to do more to spark interest in coding.
The initial event was a massive success, engaging roughly 20 million people who wrote hundreds of millions of lines of code. It was soon followed by a now-famous YouTube video featuring some of the biggest names in tech, who shared that their own early forays into programming were simple tasks, like creating shapes or questionnaires.
Now, anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, which takes place the second week of each December. The curriculum and associated resources are totally free, tutorials are available in 20 languages, and some can be done even without a computer, smartphone or other device. Anyone from kindergarteners to adults can participate, and events can even be planned outside of this time frame.
Hour of Code promoters don't claim that a few hours of coding will turn anyone into a computer scientist. But they do think that it's beneficial to society as a whole when the inner workings of computers are demystified, and when young people have a better grasp of creative problem solving.
To find Hour of Code activities in your state or country, go to Hour of Code. Or you can simply use the free tutorials.
Although the computer industry is dominated by males, the first computer programmer was a 19th-century British mathematician named Ada Lovelace. She created an algorithm that's been described as the world's first computer code. Another pioneering female programmer, Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, has a birthday on Dec. 9. In tribute, Computer Science Education Week is always held in the second week of December.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi Mi Watch specs and release date - and now it's got iOS support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi has officially revealed the Mi Watch in China – but while we wait for a global release – it looks like its first smartwatch is a serious alternative to Apple and Samsung devices.
The Mi Watch becomes the first smartwatch to receive the Mi branding, following the company's popular line of Mi Band fitness trackers, and will launch with LTE, GPS and a sub $200 price tag.
What's more, the Mi Watch has received its first update – with iOS support added to the mix, alongside the launch of an app for Apple devices.

As rumored, the Mi Watch runs on Wear OS - though not quite as we've come to know.
Instead of the typical, closed version of the software present on an army of watches from Google's partners, Xiaomi has built a custom platform, called MIUI for Watch, based on the smartwatch software. It's the first time we've ever seen a skinned version of Google's platform.
Here's everything you need to know about the Xiaomi Mi Watch.
Update: This article was originally written on 5 November when the Mi Watch was unveiled. We've updated it to offer more details about Mi Watch – and to include information on a recent update regarding iOS support.
In terms of design, the watch features a 44mm square face, with a 1.78-inch AMOLED display pumping out a resolution of 410 x 410 pixels and a pixel density of 326 pixels-per-inch.
At first glance, the Mi Watch screams of an Apple Watch imitation - which is something of a modus operandi for Xiaomi.
Not only does it have the same square display as Apple's smartwatch, but it also shares the same crown, button, speaker and mic placement, as well as the curved edges.
And as you can see below, many of the watch faces themselves are pretty close copies of Apple ones too.
Yes the design is boxier but still uses an aluminum finish – just like the entry-level Apple Watch. It's available in both silver and black finishes.
Internally, the smartwatch is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 3100 platform - the latest version of its processor, though an upgraded Snapdragon 3300 version has recently been rumored.
And it has a lot to power, too, with LTE available for music streaming and voice calls when you're not connected over Bluetooth to a phone, joining Wi-Fi connectivity, GPS for location tracking and NFC for contactless payments.
There's a quad core processor on board that should be enough to keep things speedy, and 8GB of storage, which is pretty typical across the smartwatch world. That should offer plenty of room to store music.

Being a Wear OS smartwatch you're getting pretty much the standard set of smartwatch notifications, alerts and apps.
The Mi Watch's software, as we mentioned, will essentially be a personalized skin of Wear OS called MiUI for Watch. This is a first itself - and has been designed to enable stripped-down versions of Xiaomi apps, like Mi Home, Tasks and Maps.
It's not clear whether the watch will support current Wear OS apps when it lands in the West.
That's new territory for Google, which has previously clamped down on brands forking its smartwatch OS. But with the market now moving quickly away from Google technology – it seems like something of a gamble from Google to help Xiaomi use its OS to aggressively corner some market share.
However, there's more here than meets the eye.
Firstbeat has been called upon to license its technology for VO2 Max and heart rate analytics during sport. It's the same algorithms that Garmin uses – and takes advantage of the Mi Watch's heart rate sensor and GPS chip.
That means there should be some decent workout features to take advantage of – and body energy measurement is listed amongst the features, which should be similar to Garmin's body battery measurement.
There's a blood ox sensor on board too and the Mi Watch gets one up on Apple by including sleep tracking. However, it's not clear whether the pulse ox sensor will add data to the sleep tracking features, as we've seen on Garmin devices.
Despite its similarities to the Apple Watch, it actually manages to outlast the device in the battery life department –at least on paper.
Xiaomi claims the Mi Watch will manage 36 hours of continuous use, even with LTE enabled, thanks to its 570 mAh battery packed inside.
We'll be testing that claim during our full review, but, at least for now, the Mi Watch will remain exclusive to China and release on 11 November for CNY 1,299. That translates to roughly $185.
At those prices it seems like a compelling purchase – although Apple has really killed off some of the hype by reducing its Series 3 smartwatch to $199.
The Xiaomi Mi Watch is currently available on Gearbest for around $250, but there's no English version of the app yet so we'd certainly wait for proper support. This is the same pattern we saw with the Xiaomi Mi Band – which eventually cornered a huge market share with low prices.
Xiaomi has said that the Mi Watch won't land outside of China officially until 2020 – but we wouldn't imagine it will wait too long.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Aston Martin DBX: pricing for South Africa confirmed…</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aston Martin South Africa has confirmed its new DBX will be priced from R3,6-million when it launches locally early in 2020. For reference, the Lamborghini Urus starts at R3 495 000.
That pricing means the new DBX will slot into Aston Martin’s local range above the Vantage V8 and Rapide S but below the DBS Superleggera. In the four-strong DB11 line-up, only the V8-powered coupé will be less expensive than the SUV.
The DBX, which is built at Aston Martin’s new manufacturing facility in Wales, is both the first SUV and the first full five-seater in the British firm’s 106-year history.
Power comes from a Mercedes-AMG-sourced twin-turbo 4,0-litre V8 shared with the DB11 and Vantage, although here it offers 405 kW and 700 N.m (and a “sound character that is unquestionably Aston Martin”). That’s enough, claims Aston Martin, for a sprint from standstill to 100 km/h in 4,5 seconds and a top speed of 292 km/h.
A nine-speed torque convertor automatic transmission sends that oomph to all four wheels, while adaptive air suspension combines with a 48 V electric anti-roll control system and electronic adaptive dampers to lend the DBX what Aston terms “a huge breadth of ability”.
Inside, the British company claims “class-leading” levels of headroom and legroom, as well as 632 litres of boot space. There’s also a full-length glass panoramic roof and frameless door glass, along with full-grain leather trim, plenty of Alcantara and a range of wood, composite and metal veneers.
In terms of technology, the DBX features a 10,25-inch TFT screen in the centre console as well as a 12,3-inch TFT screen ahead of the driver. Apple CarPlay comes as standard, as does a 360-degree camera system and ambient lighting that offers 64 different colours in two zones.

Scientists around the world have used neural networks to train self-driving cars, diagnose disease, and search for exoplanets. Now, someone is finally leveraging this technology to do something useful: sorting Lego bricks. On YouTube, you can learn how one man created a Lego sorting machine using AI, motors, and of course, Lego bricks. 
When you look at a pile of Lego blocks, your brain knows how to identify the pieces from any orientation or background as long as you can see the whole block. Even kids can spot the difference between a 2×1 red block, a 4×1 green, and one of those little hinge things. A traditional computer system for identifying blocks would need programmatic information about what the block looks like from every angle. A neural network works more like your brain to learn what those parts look like. 
The mechanical element of the sorting machine is composed of over 10,000 Lego bricks with six Lego motors and nine servos. To sort Lego bricks, you just dump them in the hopper and let the machine go to work. The Universal Lego Sorter, as it’s understandably called, uses a motorized belt to pull pieces out of the sorting bin. Next, they cross a vibrating platform powered by off-set Lego motor. That ensures the blocks separate so the camera can see each one individually. A series of gates on the motorized belt can direct the parts into the appropriate bin. 
It can identify and sort one brick every two seconds, but getting there was no simple feat. Designer Daniel West says the Universal Lego Sorter can recognize about 3,000 different Lego parts — the entire catalog. It can even recognize blocks that it’s never seen in real life thanks to 3D models of Lego components available on sites like Rebrickable. That’s what West used as training data for the convolutional neural network, which runs on a nearby computer. The 3D models made training vastly easier as West only needed a few real photos of Lego bricks for fine-tuning the model. 
West spent the last several years working on this project and hopes to write an academic paper on it. He hasn’t committed to releasing instructions on how to build the mechanical parts of the machine, but he is open to releasing the AI software for free.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Headphone Deals for Christmas 2019</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has made a lot of improvements to the EarPods bundled with its iPhones, but buying a pair of AirPods or other premium headphones remains an obvious and effective upgrade. Good-quality headphones can transform your experience with a phone, a tablet, a Mac or a home sound system, and they don't have to cost a fortune either.
In this article we gather the best headphone deals currently on offer, as well as our general tips on what features you should be looking for and the price you should be expecting to pay - because deals aren't always what they appear to be.

There are three main kinds of headphone: in-ear (including the AirPods and other earbuds), on-ear and over-ear (a heavier, more enclosing version of on-ear). Each type provides better and more insulating audio than the one before, but is also heavier, potentially less comfortable, and probably more expensive.
When deciding which product to buy, you should be thinking about audio quality, comfort of fit, compatibility and price. Your priorities will depend on your requirements. Think carefully about:
The sort of audio you listen to. Different headphones excel at different parts of the spectrum, and you should find a pair that suit your favourites, such as bass for dance music (something that Beats headphones tend to be good at). Check reviews and product descriptions for discussion of specific types of audio.
What you'll be doing. If you'll be running and working out, you'll probably need the headphones to be sweat-proof and to have ear clips or a neck band (or both) to keep them on. For a noisy commute you might want noise isolation.
Devices you need the headphones to be compatible with - ie the ports they need to be able to plug into. Current iPhones don't have 3.5mm headphone ports so consider Lightning or Bluetooth.
Your budget. If you want top-spec audio you'll have to pay for the privilege (£500-£600 isn't unusual) but it's possible to get a decent pair for well under £100. Sony's MDR-ZX330BT are a nice choice at under £50.
Our specialised buying guides are a good source of detailed advice. We look at Lightning headphones, wireless headphones and running headphones in separate group tests. Check out all the best Apple Christmas deals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Apple products predictions 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple held three big events in 2019, and launched a lot of new products, but there are plenty of rumoured Apple products still be unveiled that we expect to see in 2020.
In this article we'll take a look at what we can expect from Apple in 2020. We've donned our prognostication hats and investigated every rumour and trend we could find to bring you our predictions for the new decade. Read on to find out what could be in store, from new iPhones, iPads and Macs, enhancements to the software, and some exciting news in terms of music and TV.
Apple has confirmed that the Pro Display and Mac Pro will launch in December and it seems that you'll be able to order your new Mac Pro on 10 December. Here's what you need to know:
Apple revealed the new Mac Pro on stage at WWDC 2019 and said the new machine would go on sale in the autumn. We're not sure what Apple's definition of autumn is, but now the company has indicated a 10 December shipping date. Based on the launch on the Mac Pro back in 2013 it's possible that the majority of the new units won't ship until January 2020 or even February though (just as was the case in 2013/14).
The new Mac Pro returns the look of Apple's most powerful computer to the look of the 'cheese grater' first generation Mac Pro after the second generation 'trash can' version that has just been retired.
Available with 8-28 cores and specs that elevate it above the iMac Pro, the Mac Pro (confused?) will cost from $5,999.
When? December 2019
Alongside the new Mac Pro, Apple revealed a new 6K display that costs $4,999 - and another $999 if you want a stand for it. Read more about the new Apple display here.
It's got a jaw-dropping price to match the Mac Pro, but the market for it is very niche.
As for when it will arrive, well it will be at the same time as the Mac Pro, so 10 December.
When? December 2019
That's probably it for 2019 - Apple could always surprise us by sneaking out a press release announcing a new iPad Pro or before the end of 2019, but that seems unlikely. There are a lot of products we expect to appear in 2020, read on to find out what's in the pipeline... 
If you are interested you can find out when is the next Apple event here.
Apple discontinued the smaller iPhone SE in September 2018, leaving many iPhone fans complaining about the lack of a small and cheap iPhone handset. There are those who feel even the 4.7in iPhone 8 is too big.
It's no surprise therefore that there are calls for Apple to launch an iPhone SE2, a follow up to the 4in iPhone SE model that was first introduced back in March 2016.
Every time we think that its days are numbered a new rumour surfaces about the new iPhone SE, so maybe it has a future. If the new model launches it is likely to adopt the slightly larger design of the iPhone 8 along with upgraded internals such as the A11 chip and a more powerful camera.
There are even reports that it could get an iPhone X-style look, but we're not sure Apple is ready to bring Face ID to its entry-level iPhone just yet.
Read more here: iPhone SE 2 release date
When? Spring 2020
Apple updated the iPad, iPad mini and iPad Air in 2019, but the iPad Pro didn't get a look in. That's not a complete surprise, the Pro doesn't always see a yearly update, but it does suggest that we will definitely see a new iPad Pro in 2020. We estimate a spring launch for a new model with an updated processor and improved cameras.
You can find out more about what's expected from the New iPad Pro here.
When? Spring 2020
On 1 November 2019 Apple launched its new TV+ service via which it will deliver new TV shows and movies. It seems likely that the Apple TV set-top-box will see a revamp. We may even see a cheaper Apple TV stick launch, which could help Apple get its content out to the masses.
Although as more and more TV manufacturers add support for AirPlay 2 to their sets, maybe there will be no need for the Apple TV set-top box in the future.
When? Spring 2020
Apple is said to be working on some over-the-ear headphones to join its AirPods, AirPods Pro and the standard EarPods.
Read all the news about the StudioPods here.
When? Spring 2020
There's one more *Pod hopefully coming our way. We expect Apple to update the HomePod - although it's not really clear what the company could do to improve the speaker, other than make it cheaper.
There are rumours that Apple could launch a smaller, cheaper HomePod in a bid to better compete with Amazon and Google. A cheaper device would certainly help it sell a few more of the Siri-powered speakers.
Alternatively, a Siri-powered Beats speaker could make an appearance.
Or Apple could give up on the HomePod and push Apple Music on to competitor smart speakers - Apple Music is already compatible with the Amazon Echo, for example. Read: How to get Apple Music on Amazon Echo.
Here's everything we know about HomePod 2.
When? Spring 2020
The MacBook Air was updated in July 2019. However, this was a minor update. There was actually no change at all to the spec (aside from the addition of True Tone, a screen feature).
It seems that July 2019 was more of an opportunity for Apple to drop prices across the range (by £100/$100) and remove the old-style Air from sale in the run up to Back To School shopping season.
The surprise was that while Apple claimed the update went some way to make improvements to the keyboard,  which has suffered well publicised problems (read about the problems with the current keyboard here), the keyboard still uses the butterfly mechanism thought to be the root of the issues.
It is likely that 2020 will bring a new MacBook Air with a new keyboard. Apple has already introduced a new-style keyboard on the 16in MacBook Pro, so we expect it to role that out to other Mac laptops. But we would be surprised to see it before WWDC in June.
When? WWDC 2020
The Mac mini saw some much-needed love at Apple's October 2018 event. Featuring a new Space Grey finish, the new Mac mini continues its theme of packing a lot of power into a tiny package.
There was no update to the Mac mini in 2019 so the minute Mac is surely due an update in 2020? You can read about the next Mac mini here.
When? WWDC 2020
It's long been rumoured that Apple plans to eventually stop relying on Intel's processors, bringing processor development in house. The company already makes the processors for the iPhone and iPad, and some secondary processors for Macs (the T2 chip, for example), but 2020 could see Apple launch its first Mac with an Apple CPU.
Back in 2018 there were rumours that Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020.
This new Mac could potentially run iOS alongside macOS.
Read more about this project, or projects, which have codenames of Star and Kalamata here.
When? WWDC 2020
Apple's made clear its interest in augmented reality, and we may hear more about Apple's plans to make Apple AR Glasses in 2020!
While the rumours suggest we won't see Apple's AR product until 2021 or 2022, it's possible that Apple may share its plans with developers at WWDC in an attempt to get them to design apps for the new device.
When? WWDC 2020
There should be a big change coming to iPhones in 2020. Apple is said to be set to introduce 5G-capable iPhones.
We have lots of information about Apple's plans for a 5G iPhone, and a roundup of all the iPhone 12 rumours.
When? September 2020
We expect Apple to announced iOS 14 at WWDC. We can only imagine the new features that could arrive with the next version, which is likely to arrive on iPhones in September 2020.
When? September 2020
In 2019 Apple created a new operating system for the iPad called iPadOS. We can expect much more from this interface in the future, perhaps it will become more and more like the Mac...
When? September 2020
Twenty years after Apple unveiled Mac OS X maybe it's time for the Mac operating system to get a new name. How about macOS 11? Or a complete merger of the iPad and Mac operating systems. We'll wait to find out!
When? October 2020
Not to forget Apple's other two OSs. Apple will also reveal updates to tvOS and watchOS 6 at WWDC 2020.
When? September 2020
The Apple Car was the hot rumour of 2016, but it's since emerged that Apple has scaled back its ambitions on this front but something is definitely happening in the motoring field. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research.
Industry chatter suggests 2020 is a possible date for a launch - which sounds crazy to us. But, if this is correct, it might be worth holding back on upgrading to your existing run-around until then.
When? Depends... Is it really a car or just software?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A protocol signed Friday in Lisbon will allow the State Booking Centre to operate an online scheduling service via the ePortugal Portal, the Ministry of Justice (MJ) informed.
The aim of this protocol, signed by the Institute of Registries and Notaries (IRN), the Institute of Financial Management and Justice Infrastructures (IGFEJ) and the Agency for Administrative Modernization (AMA), is to increase the speed of service to obtain official documents, such as a citizen's ID card, previously only available on the justiça.gov.pt portal.
Consulting the status of online applications for renewal of ID cards will now also be available on the ePortugal Portal.
71,007 online renewals of ID cards were carried out through the ePortugal Portal, between 20 June, the date on which the service was launched, and the last Wednesday, indicated the MJ.
These initiatives were announced as part of an attempt to modernise the digital services of Justice. It is now possible to use the Digital Mobile Key, as a means of simple and secure authentication, and which are part of the Digital Platform of Justice (https://justica.gov.pt/).
Among the available services, the Online Criminal Record Certificate, which now includes a new permanent criminal certificate functionality, useful for applicants who need this information repeatedly.
Between August 2016 and November 2019, more than 170,000 online criminal record certificates were issued.

    <h5 class="mb-1">iPadOS 14 release date & new features rumours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple surprised many fans when it unveiled a separate operating system for iPad at WWDC 2019 called iPadOS. This new software freed the tablets from some of the restrictions imposed by running on the same OS as the iPhone and paved a way for two streams of device going forward. While the version numbers may retain similar counts - iPadOS 13 and iOS 13 - there is plenty to differentiate between the platforms. Now, as the first major update to iPadOS is on the horizon, we look at what you can expect from iPadOS 14.
Obviously, due to the newness of iPadOS (the first instalment of which launched in autumn 2019), there isn't much form to go on when predicting release dates. Traditionally, iOS updates are announced at WWDC in June then released alongside new iPhones in September. In 2019 Apple followed the same pattern with iPadOS and it's highly likely that this will be true in 2020.
This isn't certain, though, as Apple's iPad launch events are far less predictable than its iPhone events, and it's possible that it will decide to tie iPadOS updates in with them.
The iPad 10.2in came out in September 2019, but we've also seen new iPads at education-focused events in spring, at WWDC in summer and at dedicated launch events in October, which used to be when most of Apple's tablets made their debuts - as was the case with the iPad Pro 11in (2018) and iPad Pro 12.9in (2018). There's quite a few openings when iPadOS 14 may appear... but we still think September is the best bet.
This also remains unclear at the moment. When iPadOS first released it was available for all tablets stretching back to the iPad Air 2, but if the device you're on now didn't get iPadOS 13 then there's practically no chance that it will be compatible with iPadOS 14.
Here's a list of devices that support iPadOS 13 and should hopefully work with iPadOS 14:
With the release date still far off in the distance, there's not much in the way of solid rumours for the features that Apple will be introducing with iPadOS 14. Of course, there's plenty that we'd like to see appear in the next update, so we've gathered together the rumours that do exist, alongside our own wish list.
It's a simple thing, but one that could come in very handy. The ability to put all your alarms on snooze for a specific span of time would make it very convenient when on holiday, as you don't have to turn everything off manually then reverse the process when you return.
As it's all software-based, and hardly a mammoth undertaking, we think this could be a great addition to iPadOS 14.
Apple did include a mouse support feature in iPadOS 13, but it's buried in the Accessibility section and has a number of issues. The cursor is the size of a fingertip, rather than the more precise arrows we're accustomed to, and requires the same movements and gestures as you'd use with touch-control.
Bluetooth devices seem to work ok, but a wired mouse seems to be a challenge for anything other than the Pro devices. If Apple is serious about making the iPad a laptop replacement, then making mouse support more functional, easier to find, and simply more mouse-like would go a long way to make that happen.
This one just seems obvious to us. Up until now health data collected by Apple Watch remains solely compatible with an iPhone. Now, while we can make some sense of the need for an iPhone when gathering data (although this feels less necessary now that there are Apple Watch models with LTE capabilities), not being able to then view the information on a larger screen like your iPad or Mac is, well, quite daft.
We're sure there's some kind of security issue involved, but even so, this is surely something that Apple can fix with the integration of a Health app for iPadOS.
Typing when holding an iPad, especially the larger ones, can be something of a challenge. For years there was a simple solution in the split keyboard that placed one half on one edge of the screen and the other on its opposing flank.
In iPadOS 13 this was removed and replaced instead with a floating keyboard, but this just doesn't help in the same way. We'd like to see the reinstatement of the split keyboard in addition to the floating variant. It shouldn't take much to implement but could make the day-to-day use of an iPad much easier for a lot of people.
With the Home screen getting an overhaul in iPadOS 13, replete with the ability to host widgets, now could be the time for Apple to leave behind its approach where every app has to be on the screen. An app drawer would keep things tidy and prevent users from having to create a junk folder for storing everything you don't use.
Yes, it's an Android thing, but it also mimics the behaviour of macOS and other desktop operating systems which generally have an Applications section where you can find all the programs on your device.
Seeing all the apps you have installed was useful on a phone when people were still unfamiliar with how to use them, but today it feels antiquated and messy. Just creating an Apps button that opens a Launchpad-style pane containing your installed software would be a great way to start 2020.
So, there's our thoughts so far. Of course, as more information about features that are due to appear in iPadOS 14 appear we'll be updating this article to include them. Be sure to check back regularly to see what lies in store for the iPad in the year ahead and also read our iOS 14 rumour roundup to see what the iPhone will be receiving.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Huawei stands by HarmonyOS approach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Huawei executive revealed the company plans to expand the range of devices running its HarmonyOS in 2020 and push the platform globally, but explained the immediate focus excludes mobile devices, Reuters reported.
The news agency stated Wang Chenglu, president of the software unit at Huawei’s Consumer Business Group, revealed the plans during a store opening in Shenzhen, citing local press reports.
Huawei’s aim is to continue its launch strategy for the OS, which involves a heavy focus on devices including smart TVs rather than immediately positioning the platform as a replacement for Android on its smartphones.
Indeed, Wang told reporters the Google platform remained the vendor’s preferred choice for smartphones.
Huawei launched HarmonyOS in August, apparently in response to the imminent loss of access to Android resulting from a US trade ban.
HarmonyOS was unveiled by Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s Consumer Business Group (pictured), in August as a countermeasure to US trade restrictions covering hardware and software. At the time, the vendor said the OS and its kernel would be adopted in smart screen products this year, with plans to expand it to a wider range of devices including wearables over the following three years.
Huawei’s most recent smartphone, the Mate 30, came with no Google apps, but runs the Android-based EMUI 10 interface rather than HarmonyOS.
To bolster the HarmonyOS apps library, Guo Ping, Huawei deputy chairman highlighted Huawei’s credentials as an outlet for developers, noting 5G offers a chance to build a new ecosystem.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wishu, the app that lets businesses book creative freelancers on demand, launches in the UK with €535K raised</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London-based Wishu, the marketplace for creative freelancers, has today announced the launch of its app across the UK. Wishu (founded in 2019) is the world’s first social marketplace app that allows creative freelancers and businesses to negotiate, book and pay for services within the app. Wishu lanches with a total investment of €535K, and a host of major players already on board: Y-Combinator, TechStars, and Momo.
With the rise of freelancing side-hustles, remote teams and co-working offices, it is no surprise that startups like Wishu are popping up to respond to our new ways of working. According to Wishu, there are now 162 million people across Europe and the US freelancing or taking part in the gig economy. Wishu hopes to cater to this trend, as well as suit the communication habits specifically of Generation Z (those born between the mid-1990s to the early 2000s), who will represent 75% of the workforce by 2030. 
Wishu enables creative freelancers in fields such as photography, design, beauty, music, art and dance to spend more time developing creatively, with the app taking care of time-consuming administration and day-to-day practicalities. This is especially important for Generation Z creatives, who are increasingly turning to freelancing as their working mode of choice but find their needs uncatered for in the existing marketplace. The social network aspect of Wishu allows creatives to build a public portfolio, interact with clients, attract requests and bookings, and apply for on-demand jobs posted near them.
On the other side, businesses that want to book local freelancers can do so quickly and easily, by browsing profiles (with user reviews and ID verification), communicating via the chat function, and booking in a single click. They can also post on-demand requests which creative freelancers can apply to. Additionally, Wishu states the cost of hiring talent via the app is lower than through more traditional freelancer agencies.
Moreover, the freelancers themselves are using the app to book other creatives to work with. Wishu has found that early users are likely to book a supporting service through the app, for example a musician booking a photographer for a show, demonstrating a multi-direction marketplace.
Co-founded by three young entrepreneurs – Lavena Xu, CEO, James Johnson, CTO and Hubert Trinkunas, Head of Community – Wishu has also attracted Daniel Evans, formerly Head of Product at fashion social marketplace Depop, to join the team as Head of Product.
Lavena Xu, Co-founder and CEO, said: “The upcoming generation of creatives are increasingly gravitating towards freelancing and a DIY model of building their careers. But they are not receiving the support they need – young creative talents are still spending too much time and energy on the day-to-day tasks of managing their work. Now there is a tool that does the heavy lifting for them in terms of finding work and getting paid.”
“And for those who are booking these freelancers, Wishu offers speed, convenience and security. With all user verification, reviews and payments handled through our system, we give companies and individuals peace of mind,” added Xu.
The Wishu app is available in the App store and is expected to become available on Android in early 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Samsung TV costs Rs 12 crore. Here's why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tech conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co. has created some ripples in the tech industry with the launch of a series of LED TVs titled 'The Wall'.
Now, what is special about 'The Wall'?
Dubbed India's most expensive TV to date, 'The Wall' series starts from Rs 3.5 crore and goes all the way up to a whopping Rs 12 crore. Excluding taxes. Available in three models, 146 inches (4k resolution), 219 inches (6k resolution) and 292 inches (8k resolution), the modular Micro LED display was first unveiled at the CES 2019 event in Las Vegas earlier this year.
The first in its league, no other TV in India comes close enough to stand up to 'The Wall' when it comes to the price point.
Aptly named 'The Wall,' the TV comprises six-by-six inch LED panels that make up the screen. 
The Wall Luxury and The Wall Pro
Samsung plans to roll out two versions of the TV - The Wall Luxury and The Wall Pro. While the former would cater to home cinema and gaming experiences with the features of a smart TV, the latter would be a customisable option for business, corporate and retail environments, said MoneyControl.    
The TV, which was also the 2019 CES Best of Innovation Award winner, finally made landfall in the country early December and is available exclusively at the  Samsung Executive Briefing Centre in Gurgaon, as per a Firstpost report.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ensure your safety and security while Christmas shopping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAPS’s top management seeks to remind the public that while the festive season exudes joy and excitement, this period also breeds sophisticated criminals armed with the latest scams and technology to extort hard-earned money.Mindful of this, the police compiled safety tips to ensure that citizens are ahead of criminals.
These safety tips are aimed at contributing to the safety and security of people during the holiday season.Shopping:· Shop during daylight hours if it is possible. If you must shop at night, ensure that a friend or family member accompanies you.· Avoid wearing expensive jewellery.· Do not carry a purse or wallet in your hand, if possible.· Always carry your driver’s licence or identification card along with the necessary cash, cheques or a credit card at all times.· Even though you are in a rush and thinking about a thousand things, be aware of your surroundings.· Avoid carrying large amounts of cash.· Pay for purchases with a cheque or credit card, if it is possible.· Keep cash in your front pocket.· Notify the credit card issuer immediately if your credit card is lost, stolen or misused.· Keep a record of all of your credit card numbers in a safe place at home.· Be extra careful if you carry a wallet or purse. They are the prime targets of criminals in crowded shopping areas, transportation terminals, bus stops, on buses and other rapid transit.· Avoid overloading yourself with packages. It is important to have clear visibility and freedom of motion to avoid mishaps.· Beware of strangers approaching you for any reason. At this time of year, con artists may try various methods of distracting you with the intention of taking your money or belongings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Spin waves’ could keep your phone from overheating</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new way of using “spin waves” could lead to faster electronics and keep devices like your phone from overheating, researchers report.
Modern computer memory encodes information by switching magnetic bits within devices. The new method can switch magnetization at room temperature for more energy-efficient spin memory and logic devices.
Traditional electronic chips suffer from substantial “Joule heat,” which occurs due to the flow of an electric current producing high temperatures through the rapid motion and frequent collision among moving charges inside the devices.
This issue not only causes a large amount of power dissipation, but also hinders the chip’s processing speed and limits the number of chips that can be incorporated into appliances.
“We always encounter such problems and inconveniences when using our phones, computers and other electronic devices. We often find that these devices are becoming ‘hot’ and ‘slow,’ moreover, we need to charge them frequently and have to bring another portable charger sometimes,” explains team leader Yang Hyunsoo, a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at the National University of Singapore.
Rather than adopting standard electron injection methods used in traditional electronics, Yang’s team creatively used “spin waves” to switch magnetization. Spin waves are propagating disturbances in the ordering of magnetic materials, and from the quasiparticle point of view, spin waves are known as “magnons.”
The team built a bilayer system consisting of an antiferromagnetic magnon transport channel and a topological insulator spin source. In a world’s first, they then successfully demonstrated spin wave driven magnetization switching in the adjacent ferromagnetic layer with a high efficiency at room temperature.
The new switching scheme based on spin waves can avoid moving charges. Therefore, devices could produce much less Joule heat and power dissipation. The advance of spin wave based switching could open a new avenue for energy-efficient chips.
“The spin waves (magnons) can deliver spin information even in insulators without involving moving charges. This unique property potentially allows longer spin propagation but with lower dissipation compared to electron spins,” explains first author Wang Yi, a research fellow in the Spin and Energy Lab.
“Then we can control the magnetization if we transfer the spin information from the magnons to the local magnetization, which can be understood as ‘magnon torques,'” says Wang. Just as a linear force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. “Hence, this new way to manipulate the magnetization can be used for future data memory and logic devices,” he adds.
“Our work first shows that the magnon torque is sufficient to switch the magnetization at room temperature. Even the efficiency of the magnon torque is comparable with previously pursued electrical spin torque efficiency. We believe it can be substantially enhanced by engineering devices further, so that the magnon torque will become more energy efficient,” Yang says.
“We know that the electrical spin torque has opened the era for spintronic device applications such as magnetic random access memories (MRAMs). We believe our report of the new magnon torque scheme for magnetization switching is a game-changing idea in spintronics. It will invigorate not only a new research area in magnonics, but also practical devices operated by magnons,” Wang says.
Next, the research team will further engineer the efficiency of magnon torques and explore all magnon devices without involving electrical parts. In addition, the operation frequency of spin waves is in the terahertz range. Terahertz devices can transmit data at significantly higher speeds than currently possible.
“Therefore, magnon torque based devices will allow the implementation of ultrahigh speed applications in the future,” Yang says.
The study appears in Science.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Mercedes-Benz GLA: fresh sketch drops ahead of full reveal…</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mercedes-Benz has released a sketch of its new GLA ahead of the second-generation model's full reveal on 11 December.
Published across its various social media channels, the sketch depicts the new GLA from a rear three-quarter angle, and follows two earlier teasers (one showing the new model’s silhouette and the other giving us a glimpse of its cabin).
The latest sketch provides us with an idea of the second-generation GLA’s exterior styling, which includes a rising beltline and a new rear lighting signature (we’re going to ignore the impossibly large alloy wheels).
The Stuttgart-based firm – which earlier confirmed the height of the new GLA would exceed that of its predecessor by more than 100 mm despite the vehicle’s overall length shrinking by 15 mm – promised the newcomer would boast “more character, more space and more safety” than the outgoing model.
Interestingly, the new GLA’s unveiling will be a purely digital world premiere, the first time Mercedes-Benz has taken such an approach.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Photo : Photo: Flickr)
In spite of the lingering trade discrepancy in advanced technology products, the United States stays as the worldwide trendsetter for telecommunications and networking. U.S. firms are presently battling against Chinese state-influenced companies such as Huawei, for one, that will identify if the American dominance continues into this 5G technology generation. 
5G technology, as indicated in an online news site article, "is the next big leap in mobile networking," a technology cluster that is set to deliver greatly augmented speed, reliability, and bandwidth to users. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, 5G technology is crucial to the upcoming military applications, including autonomous vehicles, battlefield robots, and multispectral sensor union. However, whether the warfighters and economy of America are to benefit entirely from 5G relies on the large part on who sets the ideals and offers key technology.

Risky Court Decision
In contrast to that background, according to reports, a federal court decision made the middle of this year, is said to have threatened to undercut the benefits that the American businesses have in the 5G Technology race, bringing an early triumph to China. In the said decision, it was noted that the present American leader, in terms of 5G technology, Qualcomm, violated the antitrust law. Consequently, the company, in turn, was directed to offer its collection of intellectual property to its competitors at "concessionary prices."
The judge who wrote the decision, Judge Lucy Koh said, she did not dispute to question the ownership of Qualcomm of the said technologies. Additionally, original accrediting technology to producers of smartphones, as well as the other tech firms, has been a core feature of the business model of the company for quite some time now. Nevertheless, the judge learned that failure of Qualcomm to share it at instinctively more reasonable prices was equivalent to anti-economical behavior.
Fundamental Errors
The Justice Department argued the court had made "fundamental errors" in her analysis, misusing the antitrust law and daunting an excessively broad remedy minus the consideration of how third parties may be injured. Moreover, the Defense Department cautioned that "any disturbance of the Qualcomm products supply, or services to the American government, or of the related R&D of Qualcomm, even for just a while, could have a damaging effect on national security. 
There is not much doubt that if the court decision is retained, it will have deeply unfavorable consequences for Qualcomm since the firm produces much of its profits from the licensing intellectual property. The uncommon feature of this ruling is that the intellectual property's ownership is not questionable, combined with the insistence of the court that it needs to be shared at a cheaper price with the rivals of Qualcomm. And, even when firms operate as the so-called monopolies, it is infrequent for regulators to insist on the need for sharing of the proprietary technology with their direct rivals.
Incidentally, Qualcomm does not speak strictly of monopoly. However, it is widely recognized as a player of a distinct role in the telecommunications industry-a role nothing else any other U.S. enterprise is likely to fill in the setting of standards for the 5G technology rollout. Nevertheless, the Chinese businesses, most especially, Huawei, possibly could. Therefore, the court ruling perhaps confers a big competitive edge in the 5G battle on China that was never earned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GALLERY: Aston Martin DBX SUV at St Athan factory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As you’ve probably read by now, Aston Martin has opened its doors to its new factory in St Athan, Wales, and yours truly was there to provide you with full coverage of the event, which you will read about in due time. The plant will build the DBX, an important new entry to the lucrative luxury SUV market that can’t come soon enough, as uncertainties are beginning to swirl around the iconic sports car maker.
Thankfully, the company won’t have to wait too long before it can start delivering cars to customers, with full production set to kick off in May. And it’s just as well, as Aston has sunk a lot of time, money and effort into developing a credible competitor to the likes of the Bentley Bentayga and Lamborghini Urus.
Unlike most of its competition, Aston isn’t owned by a major carmaker, so it doesn’t need to use off-the-shelf underpinnings to save costs. The DBX instead rides on a bespoke platform and utilises its tried-and-true bonded aluminium construction process, allowing the company to tailor the packaging to suit its requirements in terms of design, interior space, functionality and performance – and no doubt go a long way towards assuaging brand fanatics that an SUV can be a real Aston.
Importantly, the DBX maintains most of the hallmarks of the sports cars, including a curvaceous design, a massive grille (the largest ever fitted to an Aston, apparently), almond-shaped headlights, metallic side strakes, a Vantage-esque ducktail (with full-width tail lights) and a pleasing body-to-glasshouse ratio. Flush door handles, hidden window seals and a glass B-pillar cover give it a clean concept car-like side surface.
The company paid close attention to the car’s aerodynamics, incorporating features such as ducted LED daytime running lights that direct air into the wheel wells to cool the brakes, large fender vents that channel that air out of the wells to reduce turbulence and drag, as well as slots in the tailgate spoiler to allow air to flow onto the rear windscreen. The latter not only keeps the glass clear of raindrops without the use of an unsightly wiper, but also works the rear ducktail.
Step inside – noting as you climb in that the doors protect the cutaway sills to prevent you from staining your couture dress or Italian tailored suit – and you’ll find a cocooned cockpit-like environment, with the full-length panoramic glass roof opening the cabin up to some light. If you don’t want that light, you can specify the car with an Alcantara-trimmed powered roof blind to keep it out, a first for the industry.
Running across the centre is a floating centre console bridge, under which you’ll find some flexible storage space. Along the sides, the decorative trim can be customised in a whole range of finishes, including solid wood and a flax composite that is a distinctive alternative to carbon fibre. The seats, meanwhile, are upholstered in full-grain leather from long-term Aston partner Bridge of Weir.
The technology is derived from its partnership with Mercedes-AMG and includes a 10.25-inch infotainment screen – sitting above the air vents and below the push-button transmission controls – and a 12.3-inch instrument display. You’ll even find dual-zone, 64-colour ambient lighting that will be familiar to owners of the Three-pointed Star. Apple CarPlay connectivity and a 360-degree camera system come standard.
Aston says that despite the middling dimensions, the long wheelbase allows for class-leading head- and legroom at the front and rear. It has engineered in a few clever touches to maximise space – the front seats, derived from its sports cars, not only add comfort and lateral support, but the slim cushions and backrests also adds rear knee room and allow those at the back to slide their feet underneath. Engineers have also minimised the gap between the aforementioned roof blind and the glass to free up much-needed headroom.
Given that this is supposed to be a family car, ergonomics was also a key area in development. The interior is designed to accommodate both a 99th percentile man and a fifth percentile woman, and the separate central armrests, glovebox design and the positioning of the car’s key control systems were guided by dealership feedback, private global focus groups and Aston’s own Female Advisory Board. A car for everyone, then.
Open the tailgate and you’ll find 632 litres of boot space, and you can fold the 40:20:40-split rear seats to stow even more luggage; a hard tonneau cover, which can be removed and stowed behind the seats, adds some sound insulation. There will also be a range of option packages offered, such as a Pet package that includes a portable washer for cleaning your furry friends, as well as a Snow package with boot warmers.
Underneath all the metal and wood and leather sits AMG’s M177 4.0 litre twin-turbocharged V8. This latest iteration produces more power than in the Vantage and DB11 – 550 PS and 700 Nm of torque, to be exact – and it features cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. So equipped, the DBX will get from zero to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds on its way to a top speed of 291 km/h.
Interestingly, the DBX doesn’t utilise the ZF eight-speed automatic transmission found in other models, where it functions as a rear transaxle. Instead, it uses Mercedes’ nine-speed 9G-Tronic auto running directly off the engine, and that’s because it has all-wheel drive – sitting aft of the gearbox is a variable transfer case that sends up to 47% of torque to the front wheels, and there’s also an electronic differential at the rear.
Suspension consists of triple-chamber air springs all around, linked to 48-volt electric anti-roll control. The car can be raised (by 45 mm) or lowered (by 50 mm) and exert up to 1,400 Nm of force on each axle to correct the rolling tendencies of a taller vehicle.
Aston says that the system provides responsive and engaging handling on the road, as well as the ability to tackle a variety of terrain off it. The use of bonded aluminium is also claimed to provide a stiff structure and keep weight down to a still hefty 2,245 kg.
The DBX will arrive in Malaysia not long after production commences, with local pricing already confirmed at RM798,000 before taxes and options. You can get a head start on your order by visiting the Aston Martin Kuala Lumpur dealership.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tourism Whistler launches new live chat service</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WHISTLER, B.C. – Tourism Whistler has recently launched Ask Whistler, a new live chat service providing users with quick access to local resources and resort information to fulfill their in-resort needs.
“Ask Whistler evolved after several months of research and planning as we recognized more and more of our guests are looking for information quickly and easily via their mobile devices,” says Kirsten Homeniuk, vice-president of marketing at Tourism Whistler. “With Ask Whistler we are able to elevate the in-resort experience for guests by providing access to a live, local agent to answer their questions immediately through the tools they are already using.”
Currently, the new online chat service can be accessed through three online platforms including Facebook Messenger and through SMS text or WhatsApp. Alternatively, signage throughout Whistler Village includes QR codes allowing guests to start chatting with a visitor service agent by simply scanning a code with the camera on their mobile device. With the intention of directly reducing guest pain-points while in-resort, Ask Whistler provides guest assistance between the hours of 8am – 9pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
“From getting insider tips on things to do, to deciding where to dine or helping them find their way, Ask Whistler was created to help guests uncover everything Whistler has to offer,” says Tory Kargl, director, visitor services & whistler.com at Tourism Whistler. “With Ask Whistler, we are able to connect with guests beyond the booking experience by providing them with a platform they can use during their stay to gain assistance and information on all things Whistler.”
Guests interested is using the Ask Whistler service while in resort can take advantage of the free WiFi locations throughout Whistler Village to avoid data usage fees. Introduced last year, the Resort Municipality of Whistler and Tourism Whistler partnered to install free WiFi in key locations throughout the resort. Current free WiFi locations in Whistler Village include: Mountain and Village Squares, Gateway Bus Loop, Village Common, Town Plaza, Whistler Olympic Plaza and the Whistler Conference Centre.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Volvo XC40 Recharge – EV influenced by Tesla Model 3</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Volvo’s first electric vehicle, the XC40 Recharge, wouldn’t have been the same if it wasn’t for the arrival of the Tesla Model 3. Volvo’s chief technology officer, Henrik Green told Automotive News Europe that the introduction of the Model 3 midway through the XC40 Recharge’s development was game-changing.
He cited the Model 3’s battery in particular, stating that Tesla’s decision to offer over 70 kWh of battery capacity in the sedan meant that Volvo had no choice but to respond. “We increased the battery size. We thought we had a good balance between cost and size before, but when we saw that [Model 3] come out we said, maybe they have a point here,” Green told the publication.
So, instead of equipping the XC40 Recharge with a 60-plus kWh battery, Volvo went ahead with the 78 kWh unit. “We put in some extra modules. It moves the price point up a bit but it adds range so we would be in the same area as the Model 3,” said the CTO.
According to the Swedish automaker, the electric SUV (which weighs up to 2,250 kg depending on the level of equipment) boasts a driving range of around 400 km based on WLTP regulations. Comparatively, the Model 3 Long Range gets up to 560 km on a single charge, and pricing starts from 54,090 euros (RM249k) in Europe.
Volvo has yet to reveal the pricing for the XC40 Recharge, but it’s expected to be priced similarly as the Polestar 2, which will retail for between 40,000 (RM184k) to 60,000 euros (RM276k).
To add to that, Green also revealed another secret about the XC40 Recharge. “I wasn’t confident when we made this decision three years ago, to make the XC40 Recharge Volvo’s first battery-electric vehicle. I thought it was much more of a gamble, but now I think it’s in the perfect position.”
At market launch next year, the XC40 Recharge is set to be the only full-electric SUV within the 40,000 to 60,000 euro price range. Other rivals are much more expensive, such as the Jaguar I-Pace at 79,450 euros (RM366k), Mercedes-Benz EQC at 71,281 euros (RM328k), and the Tesla Model X at 91,700 euros (RM422k). Green’s only regret now? “That we couldn’t have it on the market yesterday.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A scarce localised species, the nature of its introduction from India and China is unknown, but probably from escaped cage birds. Groups have established in Durban, near Sodwana Bay and central Gauteng since about 1970. These parakeets like woodland and adjacent cultivated lands. They are gregarious in flocks of up to 60 birds. Noisy when raiding croplands, they can do considerable damage. Holds food in its foot while nibbling with its bill. Fruit, seeds, grain, flowers and nectar are food preferences.
Their flight is swift and direct with fast wing beats. The call is a loud shrill kee – ak repeated slowly or fast several times. They also have a variety of whistles and chattering notes.
Breeding month is September. Their nest being a hole in a tree eight to 10m above the ground with the floor lined with bark chips. Three to five white eggs are laid. Incubation is 26 to 28 days and nestlings for six to seven weeks.
There is no tribal name for this bird and in Afrikaans die ringnekparkiet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Highlights of the day: Memory maker slows fab construction</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Although the memory market looks to be heading towards a recovery in 2020, suppliers are cautious about expanding supply. Winbond is building a new plant in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, with completion originally slated for year-end 2020 and commerical production for 2021. But now the company has now rescheduled equipment move-in to January 2022. Meanwhile, ASE reportedly is the one providing semiconductor backend services for packaging Qualcomm's freshly launched Arm-based processors for notebooks.
Winbond slowing down new fab construction: Specialty DRAM and flash memory chipmaker Winbond Electronics is slowing down constructing and equipping its new 12-inch wafer plant in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, according to company chairman Arthur Chiao.
ASE reportedly grabs SiP orders for new Qualcomm PC processor: Qualcomm has launched new Arm-based processors for notebooks. Among the chips, the new Snapdragon 7c series designed for entry-level devices reportedly adopts ASE Technology's system-in-package (SiP) services to integrate multiple chips into one single package to help OEMs lower their R&D costs.
