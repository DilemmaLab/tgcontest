    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England will play a friendly against Italy at Wembley in March as part of their preparations for Euro 2020.
Italy are ranked 13th in the world, nine places below England, and finished qualification for the European Championships with a 100% record.
The meeting on Friday 27 March will be the first of four friendlies for Gareth Southgate's side ahead of the Euros.
England also play Denmark at Wembley on 31 March, Austria in Vienna on 2 June and Romania at home on 7 June.
The Italy fixture will also be designated as 'The Heads Up International' in support of the Football Association's partnership with The Duke of Cambridge's Heads Together mental health initiative.
It will be the 28th meeting between England and four-time World Cup winners Italy, with the most recent a 1-1 draw at Wembley in 2018.
The Azzurri are managed by former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England will host Italy in an international friendly at Wembley on March 27 as part of their preparations for Euro 2020.
The fixture, which has been named The Heads Up International in support of The Duke of Cambridge's Heads Together mental health initiative, will be the first of four warm-up matches for the Three Lions ahead of the tournament.
England also face Denmark at Wembley on March 31 before travelling to face Austria in Vienna on June 2.
Gareth Southgate's side will then take on Romania in their final warm-up match on June 7, at a home venue outside of London.
The last meeting between England and Italy ended in a 1-1 draw at Wembley in 2018, while the last competitive match between the two sides was a 2-1 win for the Azzurri at the 2014 World Cup.
Both sides are among the favourites to win Euro 2020.
England will face Croatia and Czech Republic in Group D alongside the winner of play-off C, while Italy will play Turkey, Switzerland and Wales in Group A.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City 'planning on life without Pep Guardiola' amid uncertainty over his future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City have already begun making arrangements in preparation for Pep Guardiola's departure.
The City boss has been in the hotseat at the Etihad since 2016, and is said to be open to extending his deal with the club beyond its current 2021 expiration.
However it is felt Guardiola could call time on his spell at City at the end of this season, particularly if they manage to win the Champions League.
Guardiola has never spent more than four seasons as manager of one club, with him now into his fourth campaign at City.
And the Athletic report that this is something the City hierarchy are now planning for, after sounding out potential candidates for a backroom role.
City are believed to be looking to fill a position which would see the successful candidate work closely with the medical and fitness departments aligned with the first team.
The role would initially be limited, but would become very hands-on if Guardiola were to depart.
In discussions with potential candidates, it is said to have been made clear that this could be Guardiola's last season in charge.
Contingency plans to replace managers are not uncommon, but an appointment of this nature would likely cause some friction with Guardiola and his backroom team.
For this reason City are keen for the role to be more of an opportunity for the candidate to become familiar with the processes currently in place at the club, rather than to impact the team in any way.
Guardiola's position at City has becoming an increased topic of debate following City's poor start to the season.
Defeat to rivals Man Utd at the weekend leaves them 14 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool , and City's squad is starting to show the first signs of needing to rebuild and replace aging stars such as Fernandinho and David Silva - which Guardiola may not wish to oversee.
When quizzed on his future at the end of last month, Guardiola said: "I'm so comfortable working with this club.
"When you are [somewhere for] five years it depends on the results. We will see what happens this season and next season."
Speaking about the prospect of staying on, he added: "I'm open [to it], yes. It is not about what the club wants or not. For me, I want to see my players and the reaction of my players and everything.
"It is not as simple as I want to extend. I want to see the club, I want to see the players, I want to see how we are still working together.
"That is the most important thing after five years together. You have to feel like we can do it together and enjoy to work together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp insists he has never doubted quality of £52.7m man Naby Keita</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insists he has never doubted the quality of £52.7million midfielder Naby Keita.
Keita, who arrived at Anfield to much fanfare in the summer of 2018, has been reduced to a peripheral figure and played a limited role in last season’s Champions League success and the club’s current 33-game Premier League unbeaten run.
The Guinea international gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday’s 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Reds boss Klopp, who has reassured the 24-year-old about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.
“Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?,” said Klopp.
“We are not flying, it’s not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.
“Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, ‘why don’t I play?’ I get all that.
“So we stayed in contact, we talked and we spoke a lot about it.
“But in the end of course a player needs to have this evidence that the manager still believes in you. I was never in doubt about that.
“It was just unlucky and in life you need luck always. He started (his Liverpool career) really well – everybody forgot that – then got injured. And again we had two really good seasons.
“(I was) never in doubt about his quality.”
Former RB Leipzig player Keita doubled Liverpool’s advantage at the Vitality Stadium and then slipped in Mohamed Salah for the third after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring.
Liverpool last lost a league game back in early January but, despite building a sizeable points advantage over Leicester and Manchester City at the top of the table, Klopp is not getting carried away.
“I don’t know if it’s so special because we don’t think about it,” he said of the unbeaten run.
“We get confronted with our winning streak always after the game, that’s the only moment. From that moment on, nobody thinks about it.
“It’s not that I have to keep myself together because I’m flying and want to constantly smile and run around.
“I’m pretty concerned about always the next game and that means we have to make sure that we’re always in the best possible shape.
“And the boys are in the same mood. The boys so far were 100 per cent serious and will stay (like that) and see where it leads us.”
The comfortable nature of the south coast success meant Klopp was afforded the luxury of giving breathers to unused substitutes Divock Origi – who scored twice in Wednesday’s Merseyside derby win over Everton – and Sadio Mane ahead of Tuesday’s crunch European clash with RB Salzburg.
Klopp also gave midfielders Adam Lallana and Georgino Wijnaldum the weekend off because of minor injury concerns.
He believes resting and rotating his players will be key to successfully negotiating a hectic December schedule and competing in five different competitions.
“It was wonderful – maybe the best thing of the (Bournemouth) game – we didn’t have to use Sadio Mane,” said the German, whose team must avoid defeat in Austria to reach the Champions League knockout stages.
“He was the all-time (ever-present) player in the last couple of weeks, so he could stay outside, Divock outside.
“The people were shouting for Divock Origi, I get that, I loved the performance of Divock Origi (against Everton) but bringing him on to say thank you or whatever, we have so many games.
“We will see how we start on Tuesday. I have no clue about that now.
“But (on Saturday) we could give at least one or two – plus Gini (Wijnaldum), plus Adam – kind of a rest, and hopefully they are all fit again on Tuesday and then we make a new decision.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Klopp never doubted Keita's quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he has never doubted the quality of midfielder Naby Keita despite the Guinea international's limited impact since his arrival at Anfield last year.
Keita has been confined to a bit-part role since his £52.75 million ($69 million) move from RB Leipzig in July 2018 and before Saturday had played just 14 minutes of Premier League football this season.
But the 24-year-old, whose Anfield career has been disrupted by injuries, gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday's 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Klopp, who has reassured Keita about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.
"Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?," said Klopp.
"We are not flying, it's not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.
"Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, 'why don't I play?' I get all that. So we stayed in contact, we talked and we spoke a lot about it."
Klopp said he never questioned the player's quality.
"It was just unlucky and in life you need luck always," he said. "He started (his Liverpool career) really well -- everybody forgot that -- then got injured. And again we had two really good seasons."
Liverpool last lost a league game in early January but despite an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester, Klopp is not getting carried away.
"I don't know if it's so special because we don't think about it," he said of the unbeaten run.
"We get confronted with our winning streak always after the game, that's the only moment. From that moment on, nobody thinks about it."
Klopp believes resting and rotating his players will be key to successfully negotiating a hectic December schedule, during which they are competing in multiple competitions.
"It was wonderful -- maybe the best thing of the (Bournemouth) game -- we didn't have to use Sadio Mane," said the German boss, whose team must avoid defeat against Salzburg on Tuesday to guarantee reaching the Champions League knockout stages."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Keita's ability has never been in question, says Klopp</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has made it clear that he never doubted the talent of industrious midfielder Naby Keita.
Keita, who arrived at Anfield to much fanfare in the summer of 2018, has been reduced to a peripheral figure and played a limited role in last season's Champions League success and the club's current 33-game Premier League unbeaten run.
The Guinea international gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday's 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Reds boss Klopp, who has reassured the 24-year-old about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.

"Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, 'why don't I play?' I get all that.
"So, we stayed in contact, we talked, and we spoke a lot about it.
"But in the end, of course, a player needs to have this evidence that the manager still believes in you. I was never in doubt about that.
"It was just unlucky and in life, you need luck always. He started (his Liverpool career) really well - everybody forgot that - then got injured. And again, we had two really good seasons.
"(I was) never in doubt about his quality."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jose Mourinho targets January swoop for ex-Man Utd star Marouane Fellaini</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly interested in bringing his former player Marouane Fellaini to the club in the January transfer window.
Fellaini is now at Chinese side Shandong Luneng after current Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer let him leave the club earlier this year, but the 32-year-old is thought to be open to a return to the Premier League.
Fellaini played under Mourinho during his time at United, and according to Les Sports Mourinho wants to reunite with the Belgian.
The towering midfielder has impressed during his spell in China, scoring 12 goals in 32 games, and helped his side to China's equivalent of the FA Cup final.
With Spurs' starting 11 generally made up of young, relatively inexperienced players, Mourinho is thought to be keen to add some more senior members to his squad, although he recently ruled out a move for another of his former players, the 38-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The Chinese league does not re-start until the end of February or beginning of March, meaning Fellaini has some time to consider his future and weigh up his options.
Despite rumours suggesting Mourinho is looking to bring in at least one or two new players in January, reports have claimed chairman Daniel Levy will not allow him to spend much money in the winter transfer window, with big repayments needed on Spurs' new stadium.
It remains to be seen whether Shandong Luneng demand a big transfer fee for Fellaini, but it is certainly a move which would be an interesting one to keep an eye on, with Mourinho and Fellaini known to have a good relationship stemming from their two-and-a-half years working together at United.
Spurs are next back in action in the Champions League against Bayern Munich on Wednesday, although they are expected to put out a youthful team having already secured qualification for the knockout stages.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Guardiola admits Manchester City standards have slipped</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MANCHESTER (United Kingdom): Pep Guardiola says Manchester City may no longer be able to match the standards of the best teams after a painful defeat against Manchester United left them 14 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
Guardiola's City have been the Premier League's outstanding side over the past two years, clocking up 100 points in 2017/18 and retaining the title last term during their treble-winning campaign.
Guardiola hopes City, who have now lost four of their 16 league games this season, will be able to learn from their setbacks.
"United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counter-attack and you have to accept that," said the City boss.
"That is the level we face against Liverpool, United, Barcelona, Madrid, Juventus. They are the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them.
"We have to improve and accept it and move forward. Maybe we need to live that as a club to improve, to accept the reality now and improve."
Guardiola, however, is not ready to give up on his side's title defence and there is also plenty more to play for in the remainder of the campaign.
City have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League ahead of Wednesday's final group game against Dinamo Zagreb, are through to the League Cup quarter-finals and have a kind draw for the start of their FA Cup defence next month.
"The reality is we are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially, as well, the things we cannot control," said Guardiola. "That is the reality but we have to continue.
"We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play in and other games to fight and improve on. Maybe this is going to help us for the future so we need to live this as a club to be better."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 10 biggest takeaways from NFL week 14: 49ers steal instant classic and Rams discover their horns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We’re in the endgame now, folks. There are just three weeks left of regular season action, as week 14 threw playoff standings into doubt in both the AFC and NFC.
Four huge fixtures failed to disappoint, but there was plenty to talk about in this week’s ‘lesser’ games too. Here are the 10 biggest takeaways from Sunday’s match-ups...
We hoped this would be a slobberknocker between two of the NFC’s very best, and we were not let down. The San Francisco 49ers edged the New Orleans Saints 48-46 thanks to a Robbie Gould field goal as time expired when the Saints thought - or at least hoped - they had won it when Tre’Quan Smith ran in a touchdown with less than a minute remaining.
Both quarterbacks were excellent in this one, combining for 10 total touchdowns (six for Drew Brees, five passing one rushing, and four for Jimmy Garoppolo), while Emmanuel Sanders added another through the air on a trick play. Sanders wreaked havoc all game, finishing with seven catches for 157 yards and a score, to go with that TD pass. He was helped by another strong performance from Raheem Mostert (averaging 6.9 yards per carry) on the ground.
This game treated us to a delightful back and forth, with Brees opening the affair with four straight touchdown drives, before Garoppolo led three straight to steal the lead before the half. Two of the league’s best defenses were regularly torched, showing there is rarely substitute for barn-burning offense in the modern NFL. San Francisco’s win - plus Seattle’s defeat - puts them back in charge in the NFC West, while New Orleans have dropped out of a playoff bye (for now).
Los Angeles Rams fans must be wondering if it’s too little too late, after a second straight excellent performance saw them comprehensively take down the soaring Seattle Seahawks 28-12. At 8-5 the Rams are still well in the NFC playoff hunt, but may need to win out to get there. If they keep playing like this it would be a shame to see them miss out.
Jared Goff (22 of 31, 293 yards, two TDs, two INTs) again looked to Tyler Higbee (seven catches, 116 yards) and Robert Woods (seven catches, 98 yards, TD) in the passing game, while Todd Gurley’s usage continued to improve - perhaps LA had been saving him for the late-season? Gurley rushed 23 times for 79 yards and a score, and added 34 more from four receptions to go over 100.
While the Rams moved the ball well and were efficient in the red zone, they owe much of this victory to their defense. They sacked Russell Wilson (22 of 36, 245 yards, INT) five times and picked him off once on a rare difficult night for the MVP candidate, and matters were made worse for Seattle when running back Rashaad Penny, who was just starting to look worthy of his first-round selection, went down with a torn ACL. The Seahawks slip out of top spot in the NFC West and out of a playoff bye with this defeat. Week 17 against the Niners is going to be huge.
The New England Patriots don’t tend to lose in December, but they’ve now lost two in a row against fellow AFC contenders, and once again they have their ailing offense to blame. The Pats could only muster 16 points against the Chiefs, falling 23-16 for their first home defeat in 22 games. Barring disaster they will still win the AFC East and look good for a bye, but if they cannot fix the offense it’s hard to see New England beating teams like these Chiefs and the Ravens come January.
The Pats, to be fair, got very unlucky with the officiating in this game, and had two likely touchdowns wiped out by bad calls. First, Travis Kelce was ruled down by contact when Devin McCourty forced a fumble which Stephon Gilmore was beginning to return to the house. The refs awarded the fumble on review, but Gilmore’s return had to come back. Then, late in the game, N’Keal Harry was incorrectly ruled out of bounds as he reached for the pylon, and Bill Belichick had no challenges left to try to reverse the call.
The Chiefs essentially won this game in the first half, going into the break with a 20-7 lead. Patrick Mahomes (26 of 40, 283 yards, TD, INT) comfortably outdueled Tom Brady (19 of 36, 169 yards, TD, INT) despite barely having a running game to lean on. Mecole Hardman’s 48-yard touchdown sprint was the highlight for the Kansas City offense, but it was a defensive play - a big pass break up from Bashaud Breeland late in the fourth quarter - which sealed the win.
Lamar Jackson is now just the second quarterback to ever rush for more than 1,000 yards in a single season, and had three games to pick up the handful of yards that will take him past Michael Vick’s record of 1,039. Jackson carried 11 times for 40 in a defensive 24-17 win over the Buffalo Bills, keeping the Baltimore Ravens on top in the AFC.
Jackson was efficient passing the ball, completing 16 of 25 for 145 yards, three touchdowns (to Nick Boyle, Hayden Hurst and Willie Snead) and an interception, but it was the Baltimore defense which shone. They sacked Josh Allen six times and held the Bills to just 209 yards on offense. The longer this season goes on, the more the Ravens are looking like the complete package, and the more they are looking like the team which might be celebrating with the Lombardi trophy in Miami.
What a disaster for the Houston Texans. They found themselves 38-3 down to the Denver Broncos early in the third quarter, and by then it was too late even for Deshaun Watson to mount such a large comeback. The Broncos stunned Houston from the offset, scoring on each of their first five possessions, as Drew Lock turned in another impressive performance which will give him hope of earning the starting QB job for next season. He finished an effective 22 of 27 for 309 yards, three touchdowns and an interception, connecting well with fellow rookie Noah Fant, who went for 113 yards and a touchdown from four catches.
Watson threw the ball 50 times in a desperate attempt to claw a result from nowhere, but two of the Texans’ three touchdowns came with his legs. He also threw two picks - which happens when you toss the ball so many times - one of which former Texans Kareem Jackson returned to the house. Houston’s place atop the AFC South is now in doubt...
The team who may steal it from them? The Tennessee Titans, who blew out an opponent for the third straight week - this time a 42-21 win over the Oakland Raiders. It’s hard to think of the perennially 9-7 Titans as a ‘good’ team, but that’s exactly what they’ve been since Ryan Tannehill took over at quarterback. He was on top form again, with 391 yards and three touchdowns, one of which was a 91-yard blitz from rookie receiver AJ Brown. He’s getting plenty of support from Mr December, Derrick Henry, who had 103 yards and two touchdowns from 18 carries.
For a while the Raiders looked like they might be one of the stories of the season, after a mid-season hot streak put them right in the AFC playoff picture, but Sunday’s defeat leaves them praying for a miracle. A January run would have been a magical way to cap their final season in Oakland, and while 6-7 is a marked improvement on the dross they turned out for much of last year, it is a shame their final game in the city is now unlikely to have any real January ramifications.
The Pittsburgh Steelers’ brilliant defense took down Kyler Murray’s Arizona Cardinals, holding them to little over 200 yards of offense in a 23-17 win that moves them to 8-5 after an 0-3 start. Pittsburgh sacked Murray five times, Joe Haden picked him off twice (including the game sealing interception late on), and TJ Watt added another at the goal line as they swarmed like angry bees all over Kliff Klingsbury’s attack. 
The Steelers’ offense may be deeply limited, but alongside this D all it needs to do is be efficient, and they achieved that on Sunday. Devlin Hodges went 16 of 19 for 152 yards and a score, though the lack of run game in the absence of James Conner continues to be a problem. It didn’t matter much here, thanks in part to Diontae Johnson’s 85-yard punt return helping Pittsburgh to an early lead they never surrendered. This is not the Steelers team we have been used to in recent years, but Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and company missed the playoffs last year. Duck Hodges’ men aren’t going to make the same mistake.
The Green Bay Packers now have possession of a bye in the NFC - at least for now - after a 20-15 victory over the Washington Redskins. The offense didn’t really roll on Sunday, but it was able to lean on Aaron Jones, whose electric form continued with 192 scrimmage yards and a touchdown from 22 touches. Jones led the team in rushing and receiving, averaging 8.4 per carry on the ground. He is becoming a bona fide star in Matt LaFleur’s offense, which only goes to show Mike McCarthy up for forcing him to split carries with Jamaal Williams for so long.
For Washington, Dwayne Haskins is yet to really convince under centre, and was sacked four more times here, taking his tally to 26 from just four games. He also has seven interceptions to just three touchdowns - the kind of numbers which may tempt this team to look elsewhere with the incoming high draft pick in a strong QB class next spring.
We heard this week that Philip Rivers has been in danger of losing his job in Los Angeles. He was relieved of his duties on Sunday, but that was only because he rolled back the clock - on his 38th birthday - to rip apart the Jacksonville Jaguars, and could be afforded a rest with the game comfortably won. 
Rivers went 16 of 22 for 314 yards and three touchdowns before Tyrod Taylor came in and added another score, capping off a 45-10 win which also belonged in part to Austin Ekeler. Ekeler had more than 200 yards from scrimmage and also added a touchdown from just 12 touches. Jacksonville game up more than 200 yards on the ground for the fourth time this season - a fatal flaw for a team not good enough to handle one.
Jameis Winston had the ultimate Jameis Winston game on Sunday (I feel like I’ve said that a lot this season), throwing for 456 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions (two to Darius Leonard) in an enjoyable 38-35 Tampa Bay Buccaneers win over the Indianapolis Colts. Winston orchestrated the winning drive late on, one which all but ends the Colts’ season, showing flashes of brilliance alongside the infuriating mistakes which are a hallmark of his game.
Leonard’s two picks (one of which he took 80 yards for a touchdown) kept the Colts in this game. They need far more firepower on offense if they are to help Jacoby Brissett succeed next year. Marcus Johnson did have 105 yards and a touchdown from just three receptions, but Indy’s receiver corps turns into a game of Guess Who? Whenever TY Hilton is out injured. In the end they have paid the price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everton investigating reports of homophobic chanting during win over Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everton are investigating reports of homophobic chanting during Saturday's Premier League game against Chelsea.
The abuse is alleged to have been directed at Chelsea fans during Everton's 3-1 win at Goodison Park.
"Everton is working in conjunction with Kick It Out and has commenced an investigation into homophobic chanting reported during Saturday's Premier League game against Chelsea," a club statement said.
"Both the club and Kick It Out have received reports of a homophobic chant being aimed at Chelsea's fans by a small section of the home crowd.
"Homophobia has no place within our stadium, our club, our community or our game. The club strongly condemns such behaviour and is carrying out a thorough investigation which will include liaison with Merseyside Police.
"Matchgoers who have information relating to any form of discrimination should email reportit@evertonfc.com."
The alleged abuse came during a week in which the Premier League has backed Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport.
Earlier on Sunday, a 41-year-old man was arrested in connection with allegations of racist abuse during Saturday's Manchester derby.
A video circulated on social media appeared to show a Manchester City supporter aiming monkey chants towards Manchester United players during the Red Devils' 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium.
City swiftly issued a statement after the match saying the club was working with Greater Manchester Police, who announced on Sunday morning that the man had been arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Top four in sight for Manchester United'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MANCHESTER
Harry Maguire has the top four in his crosshairs after Manchester United's thrilling derby triumph at Manchester City lifted them to fifth in the Premier League table.
A week that started with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer under pressure after a below-par performance in a home draw against promoted Aston Villa ended with a second memorable victory in a matter of days.
Fresh from deservedly seeing off Jose Mourinho's Tottenham 2-1 on Wednesday, United won by the same scoreline at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday thanks to a breathtaking start and impressive gameplan.
Solskjaer's side could have added to goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in a fine first half that laid the foundation for the 2-1 victory, which moved them to within five points of fourth-placed Chelsea.
"I think you need to look after your own results, don't look elsewhere, keep winning games," said Maguire, the world's most expensive defender.
"We've won back-to-back games against Spurs and City. We've got another big game next week now (at home to Everton).
"The top four is in sight but we just keep looking after our own results, keep trying to get the three points and keep improving."
United struggled to score goals in the early months of the season but Rashford, Martial and the fleet-footed Daniel James showed they can scare any side on Saturday.
"Over the last month or so, I feel like as a defender I look at the forwards and think they're going to score goals," Maguire told MUTV.
"At the start of the season we didn't really score more than one goal in a game but now I think it's a few games on the spin where we're back to scoring goals.
"They're a big threat, they're top players, great talent and I think it's all coming together now."
United are unbeaten in five Premier League matches and have secured their first back-to-back league wins since March.
There is a growing confidence within Solskjaer's squad and Maguire is targeting more improvements after captaining the side to victory in the blue half of Manchester.
"We feel like this year we haven't got results in some games where we feel we deserved the three points," he said.
"I think the last two games, I don't think anyone can question that we've deserved both victories."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jose Mourinho makes approach to sign Marouane Fellaini for Tottenham</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jose Mourinho is attempting to sign Marouane Fellaini for Tottenham, according to reports in Belgium.
Mourinho managed Fellaini during their time together at Manchester United before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided to sell the midfielder earlier this year.
But Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure now reports that Mourinho has made the signing of Fellaini his ‘priority objective’ at Spurs.
The report claims that Mourinho has even contacted Fellaini ahead of a potential move in the January transfer window.
Fellaini is currently playing for Shandong Luneng in the Chinese Super League and the 32-year-old has scored seven goals and provided four assists in 22 league appearances for the club.
Fellaini’s current contract with Shandong runs until December 2021 with an option of an additional year.
But the Chinese Super League season has now ended and Fellaini will not be in action until March.
During their time together at United, Mourinho was a huge advocate of Fellaini’s versatility and even described the Belgian as ‘fundamental’ after a 2-0 win over Burnley last season.
‘Everybody knows Marouane is not Maradona but everyone knows what Marouane is and what he can give,’ Mourinho said last year.
‘In this moment, especially this season and also last season he did many times what strikers couldn’t do which is score goals in important moments.
‘I know him very well and I know the positions he can play, the jobs he can do, this season you saw him as a third central defender against Burnley and you saw him as a striker and as a number eight, which is basically the position where Marouane has more balance and know how but he’s very important in both boxes, in the first third and in the last third.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VIJAYAWADA: Veteran opener Wasim Jaffer achieved another first-class milestone on Monday as he made his 150th appearance in Ranji Trophy. Featuring for Vidarbha, Jaffer is playing his 150th Ranji game against Andhra at the Devineni Venkata Ramana Praneetha Ground.
Jaffer is followed by Devendra Bundela and and Amol Muzumdar, who have 145 appearances and 136 appearances in the Ranji Trophy.
Jaffer has 40 tons to his name in his Ranji career and has amassed 11775 runs. The Mumbai-born batsman has played a total of 253 first-class matches, scoring 19,147 runs, averaging 51.19.
He has represented India in 31 Tests and 2 ODIs.
Jaffer's 150th Ranji match's start was, however, delayed after a snake entered the Dr. Gokaraju Liala Gangaaraju ACA Cricket Ground on Monday morning.
Vidarbha skipper Faiz Fazal won the toss and opted to field first against Andhra. Soon, the players made their way into the middle and just when play was about to start, the reptile entered the playing arena and play was halted.
The official Twitter handle of BCCI Domestic posted a 13-second video in which the snake can be seen slithering around in the field even as the players watched on with puzzled faces.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Team bonding exercise: India U-19 cricketers go for 'Tiger Safari'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Team-bonding activities have been in vogue ever since Rahul Dravid started mentoring India's junior teams and continuing the tradition, the World Cup-bound under-19 squad is spending a couple of days at the Kabini Forest Safari at the Nagarhole National Park as part of that exercise.
BCCI GM (Cricket Operations) Saba Karim and National Cricket Academy COO Tufan Ghosh said that the entire exercise has been designed in consultation with NCA director Rahul Dravid, who mentors the India A and Under-19 squads.
"It's a two-day team bonding exercise and not a boot camp or anything. If I remember, earlier an India A team had also gone to the Nagarhole National Park. We keep having these activities for U-19 and A teams. This is not for the senior team though which has its own schedule," Karim said on Monday.
The Nagarhole National Park is in the Mysore district of Karnataka.
COO Ghosh then explained that the BCCI has engaged with a company which organises these team-bonding activities, including 'Tiger Safari'.
"The boys in the India U-19 team come from various parts of the country. This kind of team bonding exercise helps them build relationships, grow trust which is required in team environment. Also certain activities are designed which can test how they react to different situations," Ghosh said.
"The boys enjoyed a Tiger Safari today. In fact, I am told, that they spotted a couple of tigers at various points. A company which designs these kind of programmes consulted the coaches as well as (NCA head) Mr Dravid to formulate a set of activities," he said.
Asked if the players will have boot-camp like activities, which are physically strenuous, Ghosh answered in the negative.
"Boot camp has an army connotation but this is not like a boot camp."
It must be recalled that when Dravid was the chief coach, the U-19 batch of 2016 which featured the likes of Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kishan had a trekking session as a team-bonding exercise.
The under-19 World Cup will be held January next year in South Africa.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A snake on the outfield delayed the start of a cricket match in India.
The new season of the Ranji Trophy, a domestic first-class competition, was getting under way around the country on Monday but the match between Andhra and Vidarbha in Vijayawada was held up for an unusual reason.
Footage posted on Twitter by the BCCI showed the players waiting around as a snake slithered through the outfield before play had got under way.
Vidarbha, who won the toss, were in the field and their players could be seen attempting to shoo the intruder off the surface.
When the snake eventually left, defending champions Vidarbha took up where they left off last season, reducing the hosts to 163 for six at tea.
The snake was not the first unwanted intruder to hold up a cricket match this year – in June a World Cup match between Sri Lanka and South Africa in Durham was halted because of a swarm of bees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket match held up by snake on pitch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A snake on the outfield delayed the start of a cricket match in India.
The new season of the Ranji Trophy, a domestic first-class competition, was getting under way around the country on Monday but the match between Andhra and Vidarbha in Vijayawada was held up for an unusual reason.
Footage posted on Twitter by the BCCI showed the players waiting around as a snake slithered through the outfield before play had got under way.
Vidarbha, who won the toss, were in the field and their players could be seen attempting to shoo the intruder off the surface.
The snake was not the first unwanted intruder to hold up a cricket match this year – in June a World Cup match between Sri Lanka and South Africa in Durham was halted because of a swarm of bees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mellon: Referee 'bottled' Tranmere penalty shouts in Accrington Stanley stalemate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Micky Mellon slammed the performance of referee Tony Harrington in Tranmere’s 1-1 draw with Accrington Stanley on Saturday afternoon, claiming the EFL official ‘bottled’ key decisions in the contest. 
Rovers fell behind in the match when Accrington captain Sean McConville prodded past Scott Davies from close range in the first-half, before Kieron Morris levelled the scoring before half-time.
The Whites were the far superior side after the interval, and were denied what looked to be two very strong appeals for penalty kicks.
Corey Blackett-Taylor was pulled to the ground inside the area by defender Harvey Rodgers shortly after the restart, while Neil Danns had an appeal waved away with the game approaching its climax.
Speaking after the game, Mellon was left perplexed by Harrington’s decision-making as he made a case for the two incidents.
“I don’t get it. I think he has bottled it, to be honest with you,” said the Rovers’ boss.
“I think he has decided that he’s not going to make a decision on the one with Corey. Then, the other one with Danns, he’s about to hit the ball, so why is he going to dive? Common sense would tell me that his next strike is a clear shot on goal.
“Danns was going to turn to shoot; I don’t know why he would dive there. And the same with Corey Blackett-Taylor, why is he going to go down when he’s about to square it across the face of goal?”
It was not only Mellon who voiced his frustrations at the performance of Harrington, however, with Accrington boss John Coleman labelling the lack of fouls awarded in favour of striker Dion Charles as a ‘disgrace’.
Coleman’s complaints came as no surprise to the Tranmere manager, with the pair crossing paths many times in the past.
“Every free-kick that goes against John, he wants it for him. Every one, he contests for himself. I’ve known John a long time, and I don’t think I’ve really come away from any game and John has not complained about what’s happened. That’s just John. I love him to bits, but I could have told you before the game that John would say something like that. It’s just the way it is and that’s the way we are. We want to win games of football, we’re really competitive,” said Mellon.
“We should have had maybe two penalties, does John say that? I bet he has not mentioned that. There were a lot of decisions for the referee to make, a lot of contact and a lot of challenges. I’m not going to complain about that. We should have had two penalties, we haven’t got them, so I can’t cry about that. We have to just all move on.”
Tranmere now face a period of uncertainty, with captain and goalkeeper Scott Davies out with a calf injury.
Luke Pilling was introduced in the 30th minute of play after Davies pulled up with an injury, though Mellon was encouraged with the performance of the 22-year-old shot-stopper.
 “You can’t prepare for that, but young Luke has come on and done terrifically. He made a right good save when they could have made it 2-0—it was a terrific save to keep us in the game. We knew it may hit that tempo fairly early on and, for some reason, we didn’t meet it until we had lost a goal which spiked us into getting going.
He continued: “Luke is really blossoming. He looks a lot more comfortable now. We’ve tried to get him developed as much as possible, with as much game-time as possible. I was pleased with him.
“We think Scott has got a calf problem. He has felt his calf, so we will assess that over the next 24 hours and see if it settles down or not.  For him to come off, it was definitely too much for him to carry on.”
Rovers’ unwanted record of conceding first goals in matches was further extended on Saturday afternoon. Mellon’s side have now been trailing in 15 of their 18 league matches this season, striking first on only three occasions. 
Eager to shake off this habit, though, the Tranmere boss admitted that ‘it’s up to the players’ to now bring about change. 
“I don’t think it’s a regular thing,” expressed Mellon. 
“We speak to the players before games about the asks of each match, but let’s stick to the positives. 
“We understand that we didn’t start the game as well as Accrington, but we came roaring back and finished the game on top. We will speak to them again and will say ‘you need to start games better, your mentality has to be good and you have to meet the asks of the game early on’. It’s up to the players to then deliver on that.”

Manchester City and United players react after items thrown at Fred at Etihad stadium (Source: AP)
There’s no such thing as too much football. That was proved during this football-heavy week as the Premier League saw matches almost every day. Then came the weekend with action in other leagues as well. This week saw Manchester’City’s momentum dip further after a derby loss to Manchester United and some wonder goals.
Manchester derby leaves City’s hopes in tatters
He started the week with critics saying his job was on the line, but with two wins in the week, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ensured his stay at Old Trafford won’t end any time soon. His side beat Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur by outsmarting mastermind managers Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho respectively.
City’s title hopes were dented further after they suffered a 2-1 derby defeat, leaving Guardiola’s champions 14 points behind leaders Liverpool. Goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial put United 2-0 up at the break and City only pulled one back in the 85th minute through Nicolas Otamendi.
Football racism not restricted to just Italy
Despite making a statement at the Etihad, what also made headlines was the racism directed at the United duo of Fred and Jesse Lingard. As a corner was about to be taken, Fred and Lingard were targeted with racist abuse, and objects thrown at them by Manchester City fans.
Cameras even captured an incident in the second half where a 41-year-old man made monkey-like gestures at the United duo. British police on Sunday arrested the man after the video went viral.
An angry Solskjaer said after the match, “I’ve seen it on the video. Fred and Jesse in the corner taking coins from the City fans first of all, so they’ve got to go away. And then there’s this not-so-intelligent fella chanting racist abuse towards my two players and I hope City and the authorities will deal with it, because he shouldn’t be watching football again. Not live, anyway.”
“We have to stamp it out. We keep talking about it every single week and it’s not acceptable. He should not be allowed back into a ground. That’s how simple it is,” he said.
Stand-out goals
Luis Suarez came up with a superb shot using the back of his foot as Barcelona beat RCD Mallorca 5-2. Describing it the ‘best goal’ of his career, Suarez was quoted by Marca as saying, “I knew that it was a tight angle and the last option I had was to hit it with my heel. I was looking to bounce it because I had very little chance against the goalkeeper. It’s the best goal of my career.”
Son Heung Min also mesmerised the fans with a wonder goal as Tottenham Hotspurs beat Burnley 5-0. Collecting the ball just outside his own penalty box, Son dribbled 80 yards, and past almost the entire Burnley team, in 12 seconds to score.
Jose Mourinho dubbed the South Korean as ‘Son-aldo,’ recalling a goal from the Brazilian striker Ronaldo while he was in Barcelona. “Before this goal my son calls him Son-aldo and today he was Son-aldo!” Mourinho said. “This was an amazing goal. I know that he is going to reach the face of the keeper, his control is unstoppable. The keeper is good, but he managed to put it in.”
Messi with another good week
On Monday, football star Lionel Messi won a record sixth Ballon d’Or. On Friday, the Argentine footballer, who is the top scorer with 12 goals in 10 games, took home the La Liga Player of the month. And this is despite the 32-year old missing the first four games of the season due to injury. On Saturday, he scored a hat-trick as Barcelona moved back top of La Liga with a 5-2 victory over Real Mallorca.
Messi finally beat Cristiano Ronaldo’s La Liga hat-trick record, scoring in the 17th with a superb curling left-footed shot into the top corner and then with another well-placed strike from outside the area in the 41st. He completed his record 35th league hat trick from inside the area in the 83rd after Suarez’s pass.
Real Madrid are right next to their rivals at the top with the same number of points after beating Espanyol. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid stretched their winless run to four games in all competitions. After being held to a 0-0 draw at Villarreal, Atletico are sixth in the table on 26 points from 16 games.
Juventus suffer first loss of the season
Defending Italian champions Juventus slipped to their first Serie A loss this season, a 3-1 defeat by Lazio. Luiz Felipe, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Felipe Caicedo scored at the Stadio Olimpico as Lazio recovered from an early goal by Cristiano Ronaldo. Simone Inzaghi-led Lazio are now three points shy of second-placed Juventus. Inter Milan remains at the top with a two point lead.
On the other hand in Bundesliga, Borussia Monchengladbach made major strides to remain at the top of the table with 31 points, as they defeated holders Bayern Munich 2-1, owing Ramy Bensebaini’s brace. Just behind them are RB Leipzig who are on 30 points, after their 3-1 win against Hoffenheim. While Borussia Dortmund are third with 26 points, Bayern are seventh after two consecutive defeats.

There is a lot more at stake than World Test Championship points for Pakistan when they host Sri Lanka in a two-match series this month as the country hosts its first tests on home soil since the 2009 militant attack on Sri Lanka’s team bus in Lahore.
That attack left six security personnel and two civilians dead and six players injured and saw Pakistan spend the next decade in the test wilderness as teams refused to play there. With the country’s cricket board (PCB) giving assurances that Pakistan was safe to travel, Sri Lanka returned to play several limited-overs matches earlier this year, though 10 key players opted out citing security concerns.
Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne said it was now time to bring Test cricket back to Pakistan. “After the 2009 incident, players were scared to travel to Pakistan,” he said in a PCB podcast.
“But our Twenty20 and ODI teams have toured the country and they told us that security and other arrangements were really good. “All our guys are ready to play. We are looking forward to a good series in Pakistan.” The series, which begins in Rawalpindi on Wednesday, will be as much a test of Pakistan’s organisational abilities as its cricketing skills.
The PCB has promised watertight security for the tour and has invited Bandula Warnapura and Javed Miandad, captains in the first test between the teams in 1982, for the series opener. “December 11 will be a very special day in Pakistan cricket history and it is appropriate that it is celebrated with Bandula Warnapura and Javed Miandad on our side,” PCB Chairman Ehsan Mani said in a statement. “PCB will continue to hold similar events … as we are now on the road to hosting regular international cricket at home.”
Pakistan, who were forced to play their “home” tests at neutral venues, will look to use the series as an opportunity to bounce back after being swept 2-0 in Australia, suffering innings defeats both in Brisbane and Adelaide. Sri Lanka will be playing under new head coach Mickey Arthur, who only took charge last Thursday and will start his tenure against his former employers Pakistan.

The tourists suffered a blow hours before their departure for Pakistan on Sunday when quick Suranga Lakmal was ruled out of the series with dengue fever. Uncapped Asitha Fernando, currently playing in the South Asian Games in Nepal, will join the squad ahead of the second test in Karachi from Dec. 19.
The series is part of the World Test Championship, which sees the top nine test nations face-off over a two-year period, scoring points based on their success and culminating in a final at Lord’s in June 2021.

“People, my father is not Courtney Walsh,” is what Hayden Walsh has to keep reminding anyone who thinks that he is a progeny of one of West Indies’ pace bowling greats.
However after an impactful performance against India, the 27-year-old leg-spinner is confident that he will now be able to carve an identity of his own, where deceptive googlies will be discussed more than lethal bouncers.
“I was playing in the Cananda T20 league and someone called me Courtney Walsh (laughs). So yeah…People my father is not Courtney Walsh. But I guess now they will now find out who I am and who is my father,” Walsh, who had figures of 2/28, including wickets of Shivam Dube and Shreyas Iyer said after the match.
He foxed a rampaging Dube with a loopy googly outside the off-stump, a trait he has developed bowling to southpaws like Evin Lewis and Nicholas Pooran.
“I was bowling a lot to Evin (Lewis) and Nicholas (Pooran) in the nets. I was a bit confident coming in to bowl to him (Dube),” Walsh said.
He was visibly elated as he is finally finding his feet in international cricket.
“Yeah, it has been like a roller-coaster ride for me. As you can see, I have been working hard trying to find my way to the top into international cricket. Just to be here and perform in a game is just. I am over the moon,” he added.
He credited his consistent show in the Caribbean Premier League as one of the reasons for his success.
“I did well in the Caribbean Premier League and it obviously caught the selectors’ eye. I bowled a lot in the nets and it helped me here,” Walsh said.
He wouldn’t mind IPL scouts taking a note of his performances but the primary goal now will be to win the series.
“Yeah well, the main thing is more to win the series. The goal is just winning this series and to help the team do their best.”
To a question if winning the toss was crucial for the Windies, Walsh replied: “Yeah, I think the toss as you saw in Hyderabad, it was very important because of the dew factor. I don’t think dew was much of a factor tonight.
“But knowing that we were going to bowl first and we have such a strong bowling team. Once we do well, we would be able to restrict them to a good total.”

Shivam Dube is confident that he can “clear any ground” in the world after providing a demo of his six-hitting prowess against the West Indies in the second T20 International, albeit in a losing cause.
Promoted up the order at No 3, Dube smashed 54 off 30 balls with four sixes, three of which came in one over from rival skipper Kieron Pollard but India failed to defend a target of 170 with three-match series leveled at 1-1.
“I think this ground is big but I have the capability of clearing any ground. You might have seen today also and that’s the capability I have,” the big-bodied Dube said at the post-match press conference.
Initially, Dube was unable to clear the ropes as he relied more on power than timing which didn’t work for him. However, the Mumbai player believes that power will always remain his USP.
“I think that’s my strength and I always go like that only,” he added. When he was struggling with his timing, it was vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who urged the youngster to stay calm and back his strength, which was exactly the advice that he needed at that juncture.
“I think I was given the opportunity to bat at No. 3 and I think it was a big deal for me. The pressure was there at the starting obviously – international match.”
“After that, Rohit Bhai helped me and he said ‘stay calm and back your strength’. I think that was the motivation I needed from a senior player. Then, I got one six and did really well after that,” he added. Dube said that dropped catches are a part and parcel of this game.
“Yes, we dropped catches and it was unfortunate. Had we held onto them, that would have changed everything. But then any team can drop catches – it doesn’t matter. I think we are the best team. We had a tough match today, but we will come back next match,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rangers and Celtic target Jarrad Branthwaite struggling with weight of £1m interest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rangers and Celtic target Jarrad Branthwaite's boss at Carlisle United has conceded the club will 'do their best for everyone' as both Celtic and Rangers scouts watched him again at the weekend.
The 17-year-old central defender has been linked with a £1 million move to Glasgow after bursting onto the scene this season with the English League Two club.
But the Old Firm also face major competition with Manchester City, Leicester City and Arsenal all linked with him too.
Scouts from both the Parkhead and Ibrox clubs watched him play in an unusual defensive midfielder role in Carlisle's weekend draw at Morecambe.
And new Carlisle boss Chris Beech admits he expects offers to be made next month.
He said: "The speculation is a challenge for him. I don’t think it’s my job to talk about how hard it will be to keep him - I think it’s the club’s.
"They’ve got to do what’s best for everybody and everything. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. It’s very difficult for him to deal with that as a player.
"At the weekend, I had the choice, I could bring him back in the squad and sit him on the bench, or get him back on the pitch. I wanted him on the pitch.
“I felt Jarrad has the ability to pass and switch play. We didn’t use him enough. But he won all his headers, did an immense, strong tackle in the first half, and was excellent in terms of having a go at what he was trying to achieve.
"Jarrad, I’ve seen him now for about 10 days, and I’ve coached a lot of very good young players, but he is excellent. I had Dale Stephens at 17, he plays Premier League football for Brighton now.
"And Jarrad is definitely better than Dale at the same age."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Russia's doping ban doesn't spell good news for Scotland's Euro 2020 hopes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia have been banned from major sporting events for four years but it won't have an effect on their Euro 2020 qualification.
They won't be allowed to compete at the Qatar World Cup in 2022 or the Tokyo Olympics next year.
But Scotland fans who may have hoped that their doping could give the Tartan Army automatic qualification for the Euro 2020 will be left disappointed.
Russia will still be allowed to compete at the tournament next summer with Saint Petersburg also still allowed to host games.
The city has games in the group and quarter final but WADA's ban means Russia aren't allowed to host major sporting events either.
However, UEFA's isn't viewed as a 'Major Sporting Organisation' by the International Standard for Code Compliance by Signatories.
The ISCCS lay out the rules on doping breaches and their definition of a Major Sporting Organisation is "continental association of National Olympic Committees and other international multisport organisations that function as a ruling body for any continental, regional or other international event."
That means that because UEFA are a governing body for a single sport rather than multiple, Euro 2020 isn't covered.
The code does cover single sport world championships and that is why they will be banned from the 2022 World Cup - hosted by FIFA rather than UEFA.
UEFA have said they won't be making any contact at this stage following the announcement.
The 2021 Champions League Final is also due to be held in the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg.
Russia finished in second place in Scotland's group for Euro 2020 qualifying with two victories over Steve Clarke's men.

    <h5 class="mb-1">If Rangers scored offside winner Celtic would want foreign refs and a public inquiry - Ibrox blogger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">That was tough to take.
It wasn’t because Rangers were outplayed and outfought or didn’t turn up like Old Firm defeat earlier this season at Ibrox.
This was a sore one because it was like experiencing my Rangers-supporting childhood in reverse.
Instead of watching Rangers being battered for the majority of a game and Celtic not having it in them to get over the line, it was the other way about for us on Sunday.
And yes, we can point to progress under Steven Gerrard and the fact we did batter Celtic for the majority of the game but it seemed like Fraser Forster had morphed into Andy Goram with the number of outstanding saves he pulled off.
It left every Rangers fan in the ground exasperated. It almost felt as if we were like Tommy Burns’ Celtic side.
When you create so many chances and play against 10 men for just under half an hour and miss a penalty, that’s on you. This Rangers side has to learn how to take advantage of these types of situations when they are presented to them.
On the back of this result, Rangers’ mentality will be questioned, as it has been since they have come back to top-flight, and rightly so in some case.
At Hampden, I would suggest it was more to do with good goalkeeping from Forster than a serious mentality issue.
However, others will, rightly, point to Celtic’s mentality: battered for the majority of the game then they score with their first shot on target and see it out with 10 men to win the trophy.
Football is a strange game in that regard, Rangers couldn’t be faulted and were by far the better side on the day. If it was a boxing bout Collum could’ve stopped it after the first 20 minutes but it just wasn’t meant to be. We could have played until next Sunday and not found the net.
And that brings me to Alfredo Morelos – he has to stop letting this Celtic hoodoo of his get inside his head. When he’s up against them, you can never fault the wee man’s effort or commitment to the cause.
In fact, at times he tries too hard and often looks like a guy who has all the pressure in the world upon his shoulders as he seems desperate to score.
I am no footballer and it would be ridiculous of me to tell a 25-goal striker how to go about his business, but relax Alfredo, play the game, not the occasion and that elusive goal will come your way.
Other than Rangers’ missed chances, the Celtic goal was offside. And yes, you do make your own luck at times and Celtic deserve some credit for digging it out, but it wouldn’t be a Willie Collum refereeing performance if he or his assistants didn’t get at least one big decision wrong.
I understand why Steven Gerrard is an advocate for VAR and should it come in, it would help change these clear and obvious errors.
However, if the shoe was on the other foot and that had been Connor Goldson who was offside, we would be in the middle of a public inquiry and calls for foreign refs to be brought in and maybe even another referee strike. Collum is an average-at-best referee yet he continues to get the big games in this country. It’s embarrassing.
Rangers have to make sure there are no more slip-ups this month. The players have to use the hurt they are feeling and make sure they get past Young Boys and pick up as many points as possible in the league until the winter break.
The next five games will tell us all we need to know about the mentality of this Rangers side and now there are no grey areas. Winners find ways to win even when they are playing terrible.
If Rangers want to be competing for silverware at the end of the season, this is exactly what this team needs to do going forward.
This group of players are not terrible, despite what other people would have you believe, but they need to learn together how to get over the line.
At this moment in time, it may feel like the end of the world, and that the season could collapse, but there is a long way to go and still time for Rangers to right this wrong at the end of the month.
Most of all they must, simply must, not turn into Burns’ Celtic as I alluded to earlier. As much we all can appreciate nice football, if you don’t win much, then what’s the point? You can console yourself with hard-luck stories but those don’t sit in the trophy room at the end of the season.

The Toon head coach will continue to persevere with the Brazilian and has also assigned Andy Carroll to work closely with him at the training ground as he gets through a testing early spell in his Premier League career.
Joelinton managed to win a host of aerial challenges against Southampton but did not come close to ending his goal drought.
He last scored in August at Spurs, but Bruce said: "It’s that confidence one with him (Joelinton).
"He’s got to learn from big Andy, to help him.
"He’s new into the Premier League and is only young, and of course a lot of things get labelled at him with the big price tag.
"I’m still convinced he will be a big asset to us.
"He’s learning, and like everyone who comes to the Premier League, he’s finding it’s not easy.
"At the moment, for Jo, it’s not easy."

Davis hit a floater with 4:39 remaining to reach 50 points for the fourth time in his career. He was 20 of 29 from the field and made all 10 of his free throws to go along with seven rebounds and six assists.
LeBron James had 32 points and 13 assists despite committing four fouls in the first half. Alex Caruso added 16 points as the Lakers won their fourth straight and improved to 10-2 at home.
Each of the Timberwolves’ starters had at least 12 points. Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins each had 19 points as Minnesota lost its fourth straight game.
Davis had 42 points through three quarters, one more than his previous single-game best this season, 41 points in his return to New Orleans on Nov. 27.
Heat 110, Bulls 105
In Miami, Tyler Herro scored 27 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 38.2 seconds left in overtime, and Miami held off Chicago to improve to 10-0 at home this season.
Herro made three 3’s in overtime and another with 7.1 seconds left in regulation just to help the Heat get into the extra session. His last 3-pointer gave Miami a three-point lead.
Jimmy Butler scored 23 points for the Heat, going 17 for 21 from the foul line. Bam Adebayo had 21 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for Miami, which also got 18 from Kendrick Nunn.
Lauri Markkanen had 13 of his team-high 22 points in the third quarter for the Bulls, who got 18 from Zach LaVine and 16 from Kris Dunn. Markkanen missed a potentially game-tying corner 3-pointer with about 1.5 seconds left in overtime.
76ers 110, Raptors 104
In Philadelphia, Tobias Harris scored 26 points and rookie Matisse Thybulle had a career-high 20 points, including a pair of free throws with 23 seconds left, to lead Philadelphia past Toronto for its 12th straight home win.
Ben Simmons had 16 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists as the Sixers remained unbeaten at home this season.
Kyle Lowry, playing in his second game after missing 11 in a row due to a broken left thumb, scored 26 points, and OG Anunoby had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. The defending champion Raptors have lost three in a row.
Joel Embiid returned from a one-game absence due to a hip injury, finishing with 10 points and eight rebounds. Embiid was benched with 2:08 remaining after committing turnovers on three straight possessions that turned a seemingly easy victory into a tight one. He had seven of Philadelphia’s 17 turnovers.
The Raptors, who trailed by as many as 20 points in the third quarter, got as close as five before Thybulle’s two free throws with 26.3 seconds left sealed the deal.
Clippers 135, Wizards 119
In Washington, Kawhi Leonard had 34 points and 11 rebounds and Los Angeles bounced back from its worst loss of the season with a win over Washington.
Paul George scored 27 points and Montrezl Harrell had nine of his 20 in the fourth quarter for the Clippers, who improved to 4-6 away from home two games into their six-game trip.
The victory came two days after Los Angeles opened the trip with a 119-91 loss at Eastern Conference-leading Milwaukee.
Washington’s bench kept the game competitive for more than three quarters. Davis Bertans tied his season-high with 25 points, including six 3-pointers. Troy Brown Jr. scored a career-high 20 points.
Bradley Beal’s 20 points were the most by a Washington starter and came off a difficult 5-for-18 shooting night.
Wizards rookie Rui Hachimura scored 17 points, including 7-for-7 shooting from the foul line. He also recorded seven rebounds and four assists in his 37 minutes on the court.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Ford cruises in giant slalom for first career World Cup win</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEAVER CREEK, COLORADO – Tommy Ford cruised across the finish line, glanced up at the scoreboard and immediately pumped his right glove.
It was simply the start of the celebration as Ford earned his first career World Cup win.
The American racer glided through the fog and the falling snow to finish the Birds of Prey giant slalom in a combined time of 2 minutes, 31.25 seconds Sunday. Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway was second, 0.80 seconds back, while fellow Norwegian Leif Kristian Nestvold-Haugen took third.
Ford found himself in new territory — leading after the first run. He didn’t show any hint of nerves before pushing out of the start gate for his final pass. He gazed down at the awaiting course for a moment, before attacking. He flowed through the gates with the home crowd urging him to the finish line.
It’s been quite a start to the season for the 30-year-old from Oregon. He finished fourth at the season-opening GS race in Soelden, Austria, in late October. That also happened to be his best finish — until Sunday.
Ford became the first U.S. racer to capture a World Cup men’s giant slalom race on home snow since Ted Ligety won in 2014.
Ligety struggled on his final run and was 11th. He tossed his poles to the snow after seeing his time.
The 35-year-old Ligety is predominantly focusing on the giant slalom this season.
“It’s been nice, just doing GS really,” said Ligety, who has captured 24 World Cup giant slalom races and has been dubbed “Mr. GS” by his rivals. “I haven’t had to balance as much of my time, as far as squeezing training for four different disciplines. It’s good just having to think only about GS. It’s a nice gear shift.”
The conditions were hardly favorable with the snow falling and fog rolling in throughout the day.
Defending Birds of Prey GS champion Stefan Luitz of Germany made a mistake in the foggy conditions and didn’t finish his first run.
“I love skiing here. But today was a really bad day for me,” Luitz said.
He won his first World Cup race in Beaver Creek last December amid some controversy. Racing at an elevation of around 10,340 feet (3,152 meters), Luitz inhaled from an oxygen tank before his winning race. The International Ski Federation later disqualified him because its rules prohibit using supplemental oxygen even though the World Anti-Doping Agency does not.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Luitz’s appeal against disqualification in March and awarded him his first World Cup win.
Luitz said he never really got the chance to celebrate his achievement. That’s why he’s eager for another.
“Not only for the victory, but there is so much around it — for my head and my skiing,” Luitz said. “That’s why I’m trying so hard to get back on top.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka team arrives in Islamabad ahead of Test series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sri Lanka's cricket team arrived in Islamabad on Monday ahead of their Test series against Pakistan starting on December 11.
Test cricket is returning to Pakistan after over a decade as the Sri Lankan team plays its World Test Championship matches in the country. The first Test will start on Wednesday at Pindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi followed by a second Test at National Stadium in Karachi from December 19-23.
Sri Lankan fast bowler Suranga Lakmal will miss the two-match Test series after contracting dengue fever, Sri Lanka’s cricket board announced on Sunday. He will be replaced by Asitha Fernando, who will join the squad for the second match of the series.
Sri Lanka have also given former skipper Dinesh Chandimal a chance to fight his way back into the national team, now led by Dimuth Karunaratne.
Meanwhile, Fawad Alam was a surprise inclusion in Pakistan's 16-member squad announced on Saturday. The squad will be led by Azhar Ali.
In September, Sri Lanka's national cricket squad had arrived in Pakistan for a tour comprising three One-Day Internationals and three Twenty20 matches. Ten senior players citing security concerns had opted out of the tour.
Squads:
Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne (captain), Osh­ada Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dhan­anjaya de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella, Dilruwan Perera, Lasith Embuldeniya, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, and Lakshan Sandakan. Substitute player from the end Test: Asitha Fernando.
Pakistan: Azhar Ali (captain), Fawad Alam, Mohammad Rizwan (wicket keeper), Babar Azam, Abid Ali, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Imam-ul-Haq, Imran Khan, Kashif Bhatti, Mohammad Abbas, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shan Masood, Yasir Shah, and Usman Shinwari.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rival manager heaps praise on Bristol Rovers after Southend United comeback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wycombe Wanderers boss Gareth Ainsworth has heaped praise on Bristol Rovers after their comeback against Southend this weekend.
The Gas were 2-0 down at half time on Saturday, but second half goals from Jonson Clarke-Harris, Abu Ogogo, Ed Upson and Alfie Kilgour secured the three points.
Graham Coughlan's side have only lost once at the Mem so far this season, and it is this home form which Ainsworth pointed out for praise.
Speaking on the EFL on Quest highlights show, the Chairboys boss said: "It's a tough place to go, a really tough place to go.
"They are making the most of teams going there and struggling.
"With Southend going 2-0 up, they (the Gas) must have thought that they always have a chance.
"With Clarke-Harris on form as always, it was a great result for them."
Wycombe laboured to a 0-0 draw against Rovers when they visited the Mem in August, with the only loss at home coming against Bolton in October.
Rovers have won five and drawn three of their other 8 games at home, and will look to continue that home form as they aim to stay in the play off spots.
Rovers now find themselves in fifth place, and after the game Gas boss Graham Coughlan issued a challenge to his players to stay in the top six.
He said: "Staying there is the challenge.
"Staying in and around that area is a mighty, mighty challenge and I even asked the players if they’ve got it within them to meet that challenge, I would say to them if you turn up like that too often (like they did in the first half) you’ll get punished, you won’t be able to do that too often.
"We have been here before, we were fourth in the division and didn’t maintain it, we’re fifth in the division tonight, my challenge to the lads is to maintain that."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW CLARK CITY, Philippines: Singapore swimmers Jonathan Tan and Teong Tzen Wei both clocked the same time (22.46) in the men's 50m freestyle heats to set a joint-new SEA Games record on Monday (Dec 9).
Swimming in two different heats, both of them managed to eclipse the 22.47 set by Joseph Schooling at the 2015 Games in Singapore.
This also means that Teong, the defending champion in the event, equals the national record set by Tan earlier this year. 
Tan, 17, and Teong, 22, have qualified for the finals of the event, slated to be held later tonight.
Singapore’s swimmers have clinched a total of 18 golds so far in the competition.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sepang racing team confident of lifting EWC title with solid trio</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — With the backing of local fans and a solid combination comprising endurance specialist Michael Van der Mark, national racer Hafizh Syahrin Abdullah and MotoGP star Franco Morbidelli, Sepang Racing Team is confident of winning the Endurance World Championship (EWC).
The three big names in motorsports have come together under the Sepang Racing Team banner to participate in the “Races of Malaysia” which simultaneously serves up two- and four-wheel races from December 13 to 15.
Hafizh expressed confidence with their combination and expected them to do well.
“I have experienced teammates in Van der Mark and Morbidelli. I am confident with the package given to this team; we will produce the best results. Or at least in the top three.
“The home race at Sepang would give an extraordinary boost to my spirit, especially with the support of fans. I hope our team will qualify for the Suzuka 8 Hours race in Japan,” he told Bernama today.
The EWC, known as Sepang 8 Hours which will be held at the Sepang Circuit for the first time, is the second round of the EWC calendar for the 2019-2020 season, apart from serving as a qualifying round for Asian teams to Suzuka 8 Hours next year.
Hafizh praised the EWC for creating a qualifying race to Suzuka 8 Hours in Malaysia because only eligible teams will be picked to race compared to the previous edition which attracted too many teams.
“We could see that the year before too many went to race at Suzuka 8 Hours. Some teams were so slow to the extent of endangering other racers who are faster. This is a very long race; EWC wants to avoid accidents. With this race, teams going to Suzuka will be more qualified,” he said.
Meanwhile, his teammate Van der Mark, better known as an endurance specialist, admitted he is absolutely excited and is looking forward to racing in his favourite track in Sepang. 
Although he has not had a chance to test the track yet, he remembers the sensation of racing at the Sepang circuit. The Dutchman has previously raced at Sepang in both World Superbike and MotoGP.
“In endurance race we have three riders so the setup of the bike is never perfect; you have to find a compromise before you start the weekend. So it is a little different than normal race like MotoGP.
“However, we will always try to make the best of all three of us. We have to share the bike with three riders and normally when we are racing we want to beat everyone. For example, you want to beat your teammate but in this race you need to work together.
“So the excitement is totally different. When you have done your part, you have to wait and see your teammate. You can’t say anything to him; everything is in the control of the guy on the bike,” he said.
Apart from EWC, the Sepang circuit will also host the World Touring Car Cup (WTCR), which is expected to be participated by seven world champions, with Malaysia to be represented by Hafizh, Mitchell Cheah and Douglas Khoo, who be making their debut in WTCR. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Freya Anderson strikes gold with freestyle double</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Freya Anderson completed a freestyle double with victory in the 200m at the European Short Course Swimming Championships in Glasgow.
The 18-year-old Shropshire swimmer, who secured her maiden individual medal at this level and a European title with an impressive victory in the 100m freestyle on Friday, clocked a new national record of 1:52.77 in the 200m final.
That was 0.11 of a second quicker than Italy’s Federica Pellegrini, with Holland’s Femke Heemskerk taking bronze.
Ellesmere Titan Anderson then added a silver medal to her haul when she teamed up with Duncan Scott, Scott McLay and Anna Hopkin in the 4x50m freestyle final.
The British quartet finished 0.33secs behind gold medal winners Russia.
Anderson said: “It’s just amazing – I really didn’t expect it.
“Even when I touched the wall and looked around I saw the one by my name I was like ‘what!?’.
“I’m really happy with how I managed to pace my race and come back hard on the last 50m.
“I knew how a few of the others would swim it and thought if I could be with them at around the 150m mark I could make my move.
“It’s a tactical race the 200m free so I had to keep looking around whilst also focusing on my own race.
“I’ve never been good at short course and I’ve been working on my turns and skills for years, so to finally see it paying off is really rewarding. The crowd were amazing and even when I finished and looked up everyone was just so happy, it was really nice to see that.
“I saw my parents in the crowd, they weren’t here on Friday, so it was amazing to see them up there.”
Anderson was sixth with 50m left to swim, before producing a final 50m that was over a second quicker than anyone else in the race to take the title.
Timed to perfection, she overhauled Pellegrini with her final few strokes to obliterate Fran Halsall’s British record that has stood for 10 years.
The men led the relay team off, with all of their rivals taking the same approach.
Hopkin produced an outrageous swim, which would later be confirmed as the fastest female split of the race, to mean Anderson would enter the water neck and neck with her rivals.
With the two gold medals to her name already, the Ellesmere swimmer delivered a blistering anchor securing silver to the home crowd’s delight.
Anderson just missed out on another medal when she came home fourth in the 400m freestyle final.
After looking good in qualifying, Anderson swam the race in her usual style -conservative early on before finishing strongly.
Out in lane one the youngster was slightly isolated and away from the race in the centre lanes, but finished strongly to record a personal best.
She added: “I certainly didn't come into this expecting anything but I'm really happy, what more could I have asked for this week!
"I found it quite hard being in the outside lane as I couldn't really see anything that was going on, but I'm happy with a PB and with how I swam it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'A name that slams you' - Francois Modesto's pride at Nottingham Forest role and looking for players</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nottingham Forest technical director Francois Modesto says travelling around the country in his car, watching games, helps give him an idea of the type of players to recruit.
And he has spoken of his pride at working for “such a mythical club” as the Reds.
The Frenchman’s appointment was confirmed by the club in October - along with head of international recruitment Jose Anigo - though the pair are understood to have already been working at the City Ground for some time before then.
Modesto played a key role in Forest’s summer transfer business, as well as the arrival of head coach Sabri Lamouchi.
And to help him adapt to the Championship, he spent time getting to know the league by going up and down the country watching games.
Asked how he came to understand what is a new division for him, Modesto told So Foot: “It’s simple. I left alone with my car to see matches in the Premier League, Championship and League One to understand this football.
“Seeing it on TV is fine, but living it on a daily basis is something else.
“Here you can go to a match every day.
“Being on the ground is important, because you meet people, opposing clubs, mentality. You feel things, you impregnate yourself and then you can ask yourself to choose the players to recruit.
“It was very important to come six months before, as an observer, to understand what is happening and to adapt. I'm coming to a foreign country, you have to respect that.
“You must not change everything. I always say that when you are a foreign player, you have to adapt to the country, it is not the country that has to adapt to us. It's the same as a leader now.
“I have to adapt to the people, the football and the club here, bringing our foreign touch that can perhaps improve some things.”
The former Olympiacos chief scout represented the likes of Monaco, Cagliari, Bastia and the Greek giants during his playing career.
And he says he never imagined himself one day travelling around England in his car to look for players.
“Never. But I believe a lot in destiny,” he said.
“I remember when I was little, I must have been about 10 years old, I had seen an English League Cup final, which Nottingham Forest had won.
“It was a match that marked me because at the time, few games were broadcast.
“In addition, when you're young, Nottingham Forest is a name that slams you. And at that time, the finals of the League Cup, I did not see many. It is Nottingham that I saw, not Liverpool, Manchester or I do not know which club.”
Asked for what he thinks when he takes to the road in England, Modesto said: “I think I was a boy from Bastia who was born into a very average family, who did not think he could one day end up in England in such a mythical club.
“I'm proud of it. It's a pride for me and for the name of my family to be here. It's beautiful.
“There is everything to do to win this bet. But it's the beauty of football, which gives a lot of life possibilities.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I thought I was on the golf course' - Ex-Aberdeen and Celtic star Gary Mackay-Steven opens up on River Kelvin drama</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Celtic and Aberdeen winger Gary Mackay-Steven has revealed he had no idea where he was when he woke up in hospital after plunging into the River Kelvin two years ago.
Mackay-Steven fell into the river during a night out in Glasgow. He jumped over a wall and slipped, spending close to an hour in the water in the early hours of the morning before being taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
The 29-year-old, now playing for New York City FC in Major League Soccer in the USA, told the Football Daft podcast that he was convinced he was either on a golf course, or on Aberdeen's Union Street.
Speaking to podcast hosts David Tanner and wrestler Graeme "Grado" Stevely, Mackay-Steven recalled the incident but said he was unsure what caused his confusion.
"The nurse came through and said, 'all the checks are good - you can get out, but you just need to tell me where you are'.
"I said, 'yeah, no problem, the golf course'. The nurse was like, 'no, have a look around, where are you?'
"I remember sitting there looking at the monitors, the wires and my bed and I said, 'yeah, the golf course'. I was convinced I was at the golf course."
Mackay-Steven, who admitted he thought the incident was a bit of a laugh at the time but had since recognised the seriousness, added: "My girlfriend was there and she had obviously had a hell of a night but she couldn't tell me where I was, I had to work it out myself or they couldn't release me.
"The nurse came back half an hour later, and I said I was on Union Street in Aberdeen. She said, 'No, you're not on Union Street' and I said, 'I know, I'm at the f*****g golf course'!"
The twice-cappped Scotland international said he had asked a doctor what had caused his confusion but didn't get a satisfactory answer.
"The doctor I asked didn't have a clue, and to this day I don't know. I'm not even a golfer, it was bizarre."
Mackay-Steven revealed he had been at a party on the Saturday night, but hadn't played in a match during the day. He believes his omission from the playing squad contributed to his survival.
"Maybe [not playing] was a good thing because I had the energy to keep afloat. I was swept down the river for a good bit, I remember being underwater and going pretty fast so it was mental. Being able to swim helped greatly," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'There must be gay and bisexual players in the Premier League' - Ex-Rangers boss says more must be done to stamp out homophobia in football</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Graeme Souness believes more must be done to stamp out homophobia in football before any active gay players feel comfortable about coming out.
The 66-year-old former Liverpool and Rangers midfielder said he was from a generation which had been "extremely homophobic" but added that he had found a visit to the Pride Festival in Brighton last year enlightening.
But, speaking during a week in which the Premier League has supported Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport, Souness said there was still much work to be done.
"I think the PFA and Premier League have to look at themselves," Souness said on Sky Sports.
"You ask the question "why has no one ever come out?" I don't think football has created an environment where anyone would feel comfortable and confident about saying 'I am gay'.
"There must be gay and bisexual players playing in the Premier League, there has to be, but no one has felt comfortable enough to come out and say 'this is me'."
Souness, who began his career in 1970 with Tottenham and played on until 1991, when he was player-manager of Rangers, added: "I came from a generation, a time in our football, where it was extremely homophobic, the banter in the dressing room.
"But nine months ago I came and took part in a parade here, and it was enlightening and I learned so much and it changed my attitude.
"It was a fabulous day out, it was sunny, it was mobbed, there were tens of thousands of people there and I found it extremely educational and it was a thoroughly great day out.
"I would tell anyone if you want to learn more to come down here to that parade and you'll come away with a completely different opinion."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celtic transfer news: Neil Lennon to urge board to sign £90k-a-week Forster from Southampton permanently</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEIL LENNON will urge the Celtic board to splash the cash to sign Fraser Forster from Southampton.
The England keeper is on loan at Parkhead until the end of the season.
But after Forster’s heroics against Rangers in Sunday’s Betfred Cup final, Lennon wants to sign him for keeps.
The 31-year-old is paid £90,000 a week with the Premier League strugglers with two and a half years still to run on his contract.
Celts pay a significant percentage of his current salary as things stand — but Lennon is hopeful a deal can be thrashed out to bring the keeper back to the club next season.
He said: “It’s about affordability but that’s something we can talk about.
“I’ll talk to the player but first we have to make the call to Southampton and I’ll need to speak to Peter Lawwell about that.
“Is it beyond us? I don’t know. Would I love to do it? Of course, but we have to be realistic at times and we can’t go overboard either.
“We have to be prudent but we have him right now and it’s fantastic because he’s definitely made us better.”
Lennon signed Forster on a loan deal and there’s NOT a clause in the agreement which would allow Saints to recall the keeper next month.
He added: “If we only have him for a year, we’ll try to enjoy him while he’s here.
“He’s really happy - you can see that in his body language. He had a really difficult 18 months but for him to be back, he is so happy.”
Lennon insists Forster should be back in contention for the England squad and urged Gareth Southgate to give him a recall.
He added: “I think he’s better now than he was before and I certainly think Gareth should have a look at him. He’s been unbelievable. He’s more mature.
“He just wasn’t getting beat on Sunday, just not getting beat.
“He was absolutely remarkable and to do that in the context of a final, speaks volumes for his talent.
“He’s done it in Europe as well against a class side like Lazio, who beat Juventus the other night. It speaks volumes for the performance we put in when we were away and also at home.
“He is definitely in brilliant form and better than first time round.
“So, yes, I think he should be looked at regarding England and yes, we have to see on the other question.”
Lennon will now REST Forster for Thursday’s meaningless game against Cluj in Romania with Craig Gordon set to play.
He added: “What I’ve got now are three top-class goalkeepers.
“It’s difficult for Craig because he’s not done a lot wrong and, to be fair, Scotty Bain hasn’t, either.
“The opportunity to sign Fraser came around and I just thought ‘I can’t miss out on this one’ and, thankfully, it’s turned out to be the right call.
“I’m going to start Craig in Thursday to give him a game and keep him motivated and ticking over.
“It’s very difficult with goalkeepers but it was my call and sometimes you have to make these decisions for what you think is best for the team and the club.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three things we learned from the Premier League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool’s relentless march to a first English title since 1990 gathered pace with a comfortable win at Bournemouth, while Manchester City’s defence of the trophy was hit by a painful defeat against rivals Manchester United.
Fuelled by Jamie Vardy’s blistering form, Leicester has emerged as the closest challengers to Liverpool.
AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from the Premier League weekend:
Solskjaer’s big weekSeven days ago Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was fielding questions over whether he is the man to return Manchester United to their former glories after a 2-2 home draw with Aston Villa left the Red Devils in ninth and with just four wins from their opening 14 Premier League games.
A week on and Solskjaer has secured the two biggest victories of his time in charge since a famous 3-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in March helped turn his caretaker spell in charge into a full-time position.
United have beaten Tottenham on Jose Mourinho’s return to Old Trafford and now Manchester City 2-1 to climb up to fifth and within five points of the top four. On both occasions the scoreline arguably flattered the losing side with Solskjaer’s vision slowly coming to fruition.
Marcus Rashford has already matched his previous season’s best for goals with 13, Fred has enjoyed two of his best games since a £50 million move from Shakhtar Donetsk 18 months ago, Aaron Wan-Bissaka was outstanding in nullifying the threat of Raheem Sterling and Harry Maguire marshalled his defence resolutely under a late City bombardment.
There is still much to do for Solskjaer to convince the doubters, not least catching Chelsea in fourth to secure a return to the Champions League next season, but this was undoubtedly his best week as permanent United boss.
Klopp relishes Liverpool shutoutJurgen Klopp admitted Liverpool’s first clean sheet in 14 games was the talk of the dressing room after the leaders’ 3-0 win at Bournemouth.
Klopp’s side made it 33 league games unbeaten as they maintained an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester.
Goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita and Mohamed Salah earned the victory, but it was Liverpool’s first shutout since September 28 that pleased Klopp the most.
“I forgot actually how it feels, to be honest. It’s great, we should have that more often,” Klopp said.
“For the boys, that was the most used word in the dressing room when I came in, ‘clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet’.
“Obviously everybody was desperate for that and now we have it, so let’s have it more often.”
Leicester happy to stay in the shadowsWith Jamie Vardy on the kind of hot streak he last managed when Leicester won their fairytale title in 2016, Brendan Rodgers’ side has become the last hope of a competitive race to be crowned kings of English football.
Liverpool has left Manchester City trailing in their wake, but Leicester remains in the hunt after Vardy’s double inspired a 4-1 rout of Aston Villa.
Vardy, the Premier League’s leading scorer with 16 goals this term, has netted in eight successive games, recalling his 11-match scoring streak from 2015-16.
The Foxes have reeled off a club-record eight consecutive top-flight victories, but Rodgers has no intention of talking up his team’s title chances.
“I don’t think anyone expects us to be near the top. We respect that, we get on with our work and keep developing as a team,” Rodgers said.
“It’s just natural, Man City and Liverpool are both incredible teams. We know we are looking to improve and close the gap. We have finished ninth in the last two seasons but today we looked like a top team.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The George Cooper conundrum for Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe to try and solve</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ryan Lowe has admitted that Plymouth Argyle loan signing George Cooper has given him food for thought over a possible return to his starting line-up.
Cooper provided a creative spark for the Pilgrims when he played as a second half substitute in the away League Two game against Cambridge United on Saturday.
It was not enough to save them from a 1-0 defeat at the Abbey Stadium, but Cooper staked a claim for a first team place.
The versatile 23-year-old was Plymouth Live’s Argyle player-of-the-month for October but has been on the bench for the last five games.
Cooper played at right wing-back after replacing Joe Edwards in the 65th minute at Cambridge.
The loan signing from Peterborough United has also previously been used by Lowe in one of the central midfield roles in his favoured 3-1-4-2 formation.
Lowe said: “It has been a bit frustrating for George because he came in and had a wonderful four games – or three-and-a-half, I would say.
“We know what George gives us. He gives us that quality and it’s one of them – where do you find George in his best position?
“Is it wing-back? Is it one of the number eight slots? But, as you have seen, the eights in Danny Mayor and (Antoni) Sarcevic have been outstanding.
“The wing-backs have been outstanding but, yes, it definitely gives you food for thought (the way he played against Cambridge).
Cooper gave Argyle an extra attacking impetus when he was sent on for Edwards.
Lowe said: “That’s why we put him on there, to get up and down that right side, coming in on his left foot.
“We have to look at the overall package and (Callum) McFadzean has been outstanding on the left side and Joe Edwards on the right side.
“It’s tough to balance, but we know what George gives us.
“Defensively, he’s not quite switched on as much as I would like but that’s because he’s an attacking player.
“He always gives us food for thought. He’s a superb talent.”
Cooper was the second of three substitutes used by Lowe against Cambridge, with Joel Grant the first one when he replaced Conor Grant in the 55th minute.
Grant went up front with Dom Telford while Byron Moore moved to the left wing-back role.
Then, in the 73rd minute, striker Billy Clarke replaced Telford, who had started his first match since late September after a hamstring injury.
Lowe said: “Joel came on just after half-time and gave us food for thought. Byron going out on the left gave us food for thought.

“They all give us food for thought when they come on and give us an impact.
“Billy didn’t have much to do but he came on and got hold of the ball. That’s what I want, when my players are coming off the bench to have an impact.
“They certainly did that but it just wasn’t to be that we could get an equaliser.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phoenix Point, the latest strategy game from XCOM creator Julian Gollop, was released last week on the Epic Games Store. It was also supposed to be out on the Microsoft Store and Xbox Game Pass, but it’s not, and Snapshot Games have basically had to admit “we dropped the ball”.
In a statement released on the company’s official forums, A Snapshot staffer writes:
They go on to say all this extra work “was not anticipated by us and has caused unexpected delay over and above our delay waiting for certification”, and that as a result “We do not have an ETA for Phoenix Point on Game Pass or the Windows Store yet”.
I’ve been playing the game for the last few weeks: it has some very cool ideas on the strategic side of things, but also some very frustrating loose ends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ljungberg wants Arsenal to start scoring first</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cape Town - Interim boss Freddie Ljungberg admits it's a real problem for Arsenal that they are always conceding first and are then required to chase games.
The Gunners have taken just one point from Ljungberg's two Premier League games at the helm since he was appointed as Unai Emery's temporary successor last month.
He takes his side to West Ham on Monday night knowing they will be in the bottom half of the table at kick-off following their winless run.
But the 42-year-old believes he knows where to start correcting the issues to get to back to winning ways.
"If you score the first goal you don't have to chase the game," he said.
"You don't have to open up as much because you can control the game so that's something that, in my opinion, we need to change a little bit."
Ljungberg has spoken about the lack of belief among his players at the moment but insists they will continue working to address the slide.
"It's never easy when you sack a manager and you're low on confidence," he added.
"We started really well at Norwich. We started the second half really well and I was sure we were going to win the game and get going again.
"We get a sucker punch on a counter or as they play down one side. It's hard to take but we keep plugging away."
Ljungberg will be unable to call on Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos, who remains sidelined with a hamstring problem.
Rob Holding could return following a minor knee injury and will be assessed before the trip to the London Stadium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Torquay United's mid-season 'shuffle' under way as striker Manny Duku departs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE DEPARTURE OF Dutch striker Manny Duku, nearly three weeks away from the opening of the main January transfer window, is likely to be just the start of a mid-season shuffling of Torquay United's squad in the wake of a 2-1 defeat at Harrogate Town.
After moving to within two points of the National League leadership only five weeks ago the Gulls have ground to a halt after six successive defeats, including five in the league, and manager Gary Johnson is hinting strongly at more changes ahead.
Former Herenveen, Hayes & Yeading and Cheltenham Town centre-forward Duku, 26, moved to Plainmoor only last summer, but he has not made the impact which he and everyone hoped for.
After an injury-affected pre-season, four starts and 12 substitute appearances failed to yield a goal, his contract has been cancelled by mutual consent and he has returned to Holland with his wife and new baby son.
"We are sorry it didn't work out for Manny here," said Johnson.  "We wish him and his new family all the very best for the future."
Johnson had hoped that Duku, 6ft 3in tall, would be the sort of muscular centre-forward that Harrogate possessed in their veteran targetman Jon Stead at all-weather Wetherby Road.
The former Premier League targetman, who had been sent off in United's 4-2 win at Plainmoor in September, knew too much for United's young Bristol City loanee Robbie Cundy, who was taken off after an hour in a triple substitution at 2-0 down.
Centre-back Jean-Yves Koue Niate, centre-forward Jared Lewington and Ruairi Keating took over from Cundy, QPR loanee Amrit Bansal-McNulty and Kalvin Kalala.
By that time Stead (56mins), with a rasping first-time shot from the edge of the area on Brendan Kiernan's cross, had already added to Alex Bradley's tenth minute opener, deflected past Lucas Covolan off Cundy's outstretched leg.
Lewington gave Harrogate's centre-backs some problems, helping in the move which saw Ben Whitfield fouled and Jamie Reid convert his 16th goal of the season (67mins) from the penalty spot.
But Harrogate, up to sixth, were deserving winners. United are down to eleventh place, 13 points behind leaders Barrow.
Johnson was frustrated by the failure of the officials to clamp down on what is known as 'game management' tactics by the hosts in the second half.
"We've had to contend with only 25 minutes of ball-in-play.  When teams waste time for that long, and only five (extra) minutes go up, it's a shame - I know referees can't be doctors and physios, but they've got to read the game," he said.
But he quickly turned to Plainmoor's bigger picture.
"It's a tough period of time, but what it will show in the end is the ones who can handle adversity.  You always come out of it, but not always with the same people," he said.
"We have got to make sure that we've got the right people on our bus.
"We had it last season, but this year some of them have found it a bit difficult with the next step-up - that's unfortunate because I have given them every opportunity to do it.
"We are going to have to do as much as we can pretty soon, otherwise our season will be gone before we know it.
"But I am not giving up on it yet."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Messi will be impossible to replace, says Barcelona president Bartomeu</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Josep Maria Bartomeu will offer Lionel Messi a lifetime contract at Barcelona and knows it will be difficult to replace the talisman.
Barcelona will find it impossible to replace Lionel Messi, according to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who added Pep Guardiola would always be welcome back at Camp Nou.
Messi followed up winning a record sixth Ballon d’Or by recording his 35th LaLiga hat-trick in Barca’s 5-2 win over Real Mallorca on Saturday.
Despite spending big on Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong in the most recent transfer window, Barca are still heavily reliant on the 32-year-old, who has scored 14 goals from 15 appearances in all competitions this term.
Bartomeu has acknowledged Barca will find it extremely difficult to replace Messi whenever the forward calls time on his stay at the club, but outlined their intention to continue developing young talent from the famed La Masia academy.
“We Barca fans have the good fortune to enjoy Messi every three days,” Bartomeu, who plans to offer Messi a “lifetime contract” told Italian publication La Repubblica.
“Leo is impossible to replace and when he will be here no more, we will be forced to play differently. I cannot say that we are already preparing for post-Messi, but it is true that we have already decided to bet on young players for a long time.
“For now, what we have to do is not worry, but enjoy it. I would like to make him an annuity contract as we have already done with [Andres] Iniesta. He has earned the right to decide when to say enough is enough.
“As a footballer, Messi is number one and we will fully understand it only in a few years, because Leo has changed not only the history of Barca, but that of world football.”
Bartomeu also confirmed Guardiola – who left Barca in 2012 after four trophy-laden seasons in charge before going on to coach Bayern Munich and now Manchester City, will always have a home at Barca, should he wish to return.
“A possible return of Guardiola? It doesn’t depend on me,” he added.
“It was Pep who decided to leave, but for him the doors of Barca are always open.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reports: Barcelona ready to exchange out-of-favour star for Juventus duo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest word around the rumour mill is that La Liga giants Barcelona are ready to offload Ivan Rakitic in exchange for the Juventus duo of Daniele Rugani and Merih Demiral, during the upcoming January transfer window.
This is according to Calciomercato, who reports that Juventus are interested in Rakitic thanks to his experience and proven quality. The Italian newspaper further adds that the Bianconeri will try to add to Barcelona’s interest in the potential sale of their star midfielder, by adding Rugani and Demiral as part of their player-plus-cash offer.
It is believed that Barcelona will accept the offer, as the Catalans themselves are on the hunt for alternative options in defence. Right now, Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet are the preferred first-choice options for manager Ernesto Valverde at the heart of Barcelona’s defence – but that is likely to change within the next few seasons as Pique is approaching his retirement and Lenglet is yet to deliver a consistent set of good performances for the club.
Calciomercato further adds that the La Liga defending champions are also interested in Juventus’ Federico Bernardeschi, but no official move has been made by them to approach him yet.
Meanwhile, earlier last week, Rakitic himself had announced that he is not looking to leave the Blaugrana anytime soon.
“Lots of things have happened in the last few months,” Rakitic said, before adding:
“But I want to give my all and if I can play here then I’ve always said that there’s no better place than Barcelona to keep winning trophies, it’s the perfect place for me.”
As a result, it remains unclear as to whether he will accept Juventus’ offer if they approach him in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jose Mourinho makes former Manchester United star "priority" for Spurs' January transfer window</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spurs manager Jose Mourinho has reportedly made one of his former stars at Manchester United a priority to sign in the January transfer window.
Mourinho was sacked at Old Trafford a year ago, and is apparently eyeing a reunion with one midfielder who has also since left the north west of England.
Following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's appointment, Marouane Fellaini saw his playing time decrease, and left at the end of the January transfer window.
The 32-year-old made the move to Shandong in China, but according to Les Sports, Mourinho is hoping to bring the towering midfielder back to the Premier League.
Mourinho is notorious for forging close bonds with some players, and has apparently made contact with the 6ft 4in star about a potential move to north London after developing a good relationship in Manchester.

Fellaini is still under contract until December 2021 with the option of signing for an additional year, but will not be in action until at least the end of February when the Chinese football season begins again.
Mourinho's midfield is already well-stacked, with the likes of Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso arriving in the summer to supplement the likes of Harry Winks, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko.
However, Mourinho has apparently set his heart on adding the Belgian midfielder to the ranks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'No great panic' says Clough after Pirelli disappointment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Burton Albion’s 2-0 home defeat against Lincoln City led to inevitable grumbling from some supporters but manager Nigel Clough remains convinced that the Brewers are on course in their League One season.
An early goal by Harry Anderson, the second header conceded from a corner in a week, and a late one from Tyler Walker condemned Albion to a third home defeat of the season and they are 15th in the table today.
The Brewers’ sixth game in 19 days appeared to be one too far against a Lincoln side who had played only one in the same period but Clough maintains his players’ efforts bodes well.
“Lincoln did play well and, once we’d given them a goal after only two minutes, it ultimately decided the game,” said Clough.
“We gave away a goal very similar to the one the other night (Tuesday against Southend) and then we were chasing the game at home for long periods of time.
“The goal lifted Lincoln and they threw their bodies on the line in front of stuff and blocked shots but, apart from at set-plays, I didn’t think they bothered us too much.
“One thing I am not disappointed about is the effort of the players. It was absolutely incredible on the back of what we’ve had in the last 10 days or two weeks. They gave absolutely every ounce of everything they had and that’s the bottom line, that’s what we ask for more than anything.
“There’s no great panic. As long as we see the sort of effort we saw, and the quality, at times, we’ll back the players all day.”
Asked the extent to which tiredness had played a part, Clough said: “It’s a little factor but I didn’t think we looked that tired. I thought we played well.
“When you are tired, you can’t get the ball or keep the ball. I thought we kept the ball well and Stephen Quinn was again head and shoulders above anyone else on the pitch. We huffed and puffed but what we didn’t have was that individual piece of skill just to unlock their defence and get us a goal.
“Scott Fraser gave us that on Tuesday night with a wonderful free kick but no-one could do that this time. In the final third, there were wasted crosses and things like that. We could have had a shout for a penalty. Scott thought he got caught but it would have been a difficult one for the referee to give. It wasn’t clear-cut.”
Injuries stretched Burton again, with John Brayford, Oliver Sarkic and Reece Hutchinson missing from the match-day squad, while John-Joe O’Toole started a four-match suspension after his second red card of the season on Tuesday against Southend United.
Albion also lost Nathan Broadhead after half-an-hour. The on-loan Everton youngster returned from a month out but pulled up and had to be replaced by David Templeton.
“Nathan’s hamstring was tight again,” said Clough. “He had trained all week, with (physio) Nick Fenton initially, then he joined in with a full session and he thought he was fully fit but it has tightened up again. It’s a big blow for us because, after those first two minutes, he and Liam Boyce were causing them problems. I thought we were looking good at that point.”
At least, this time, Clough did not end the game bemoaning a refereeing performance, as Blackburn official Ben Toner controlled the game without controversy.
“Having talked about the referee the other night, I thought the referee today was excellent,” added Clough. “There was one booking, for Ryan Edwards, that was a bit inconsistent but other than that he was excellent.”
Daniel in the spotlight...
Burton Albion left-back Colin Daniel found himself in the spotlight again for all the wrong reasons after the Brewers’ 2-0 defeat at home to Lincoln City.
Praised in midweek by manager Nigel Clough for his efforts in two games since returning to the starting line-up, Daniel (pictured) had nonetheless been singled out as the defender who lost his man at a corner for Southend United’s goal on Tuesday night. Against Lincoln, Clough was annoyed that Daniel gave the ball away cheaply within seconds of the start, which led to two corners, with Lincoln scoring from the second.
“It wasn’t the corner so much, as we knew they would be a threat at those, as the way we gave the ball away five seconds after the kick-off,” said Clough.
“That was Colin Daniel, who had the ball at his feet and basically didn’t do what he’d been asked to do. Colin has come back into the team and has played, generally, OK but he has cost us two vitally important goals in two games. Sometimes, we might have to sacrifice a little bit of what he gives us going forward because he’s a defender and his job is not to give goals away.
“He put one magnificent ball across the face of the goal, which Lucas Akins got a toe on and so nearly finished, and we remember the ball he put in last week at Oldham for Liam Boyce to tap in, which won us the game. So it’s there, it just has to come more consistently.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brewers need a breather after fresh Imps run off with the points</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best thing that can be said about Burton Albion’s 2-0 defeat at home to Lincoln City is that there is a lot of the League One season left.
That is, a lot of time to forget this game and this week, one in which the Brewers targeted six points from a long-awaited return to League One action at the Pirelli Stadium and finished up with one.
In some respects, Saturday’s result was an accident waiting to happen. Patched up even more than usual because of injuries, Burton were playing their sixth match in 19 days against a Lincoln side who had played one match in the same period, the best part of three weeks ago.
Were the Imps absolutely bursting to get back into action? You bet they were and they delivered a performance full of determination, organisation and swift, sharp passing.
Frankly, it was like watching one of the Brewers’ better away performances. They pressed relentlessly without the ball, threw themselves in the way of crosses and shots and they broke forward decisively and inventively.
The doom-mongers, waiting to pounce, who saw this as a terrible Burton performance are way off the mark, their eyes clouded by the second disappointing result of the week. There was plenty of endeavour about Albion and a good few chances created. But this was a tired performance and the first week without a midweek game for a while will be welcome.
Stats can turn around quickly, too. The Brewers went into this one with one defeat in seven League games. The alternative sequence now is one win in six but it has certainly been no help that they have been so strung out, with half of the last 10 games having been in cup competitions. That, at least, will start to ease.
The extent to which Burton, missing John Brayford, Oliver Sarkic, Reece Hutchinson and John-Joe O’Toole, were stretched was emphasised by a bench featuring two goalkeepers - an odd move - two others learning their trade and the fitness coach. The only two used, Joe Sbarra and David Templeton, were the only two likely to be.
With all of those circumstances in place, the last thing the Brewers needed to do was concede an early goal but they did, to a second free header from a corner in a week.
Colin Daniel, who endured a difficult afternoon, gave the ball away as Lincoln won an immediate corner, then a second, and Harry Anderson ran across the area to glance in a header from it. The goal gave Lincoln a lift and something to hang on to.
It took Burton 10 minutes or so to get any kind of passing going, a spell during which former loanee Jake Hesketh was booked for diving as he avoided a Jake Buxton challenge.
Liam Boyce, running from 40 yards out, drove a shot wide from just outside the box but there was little for a travelling contingent from his old club in Northern Ireland, Cliftonville, to cheer.
Albion were buzzing around keenly but misplacing too many passes and Ryan Edwards sent a shot wildly out of the ground before being booked for delaying a throw-in, a cheap yellow card which now brings him a suspension.
One promising break found Boyce offside when Scott Fraser played him in and when he was next clear, and onside, his shot was turned away by Lincoln keeper Josh Vickers.
Nathan Broadhead had started but the Everton loanee limped off with a tight hamstring after 33 minutes.
Before half-time, Fraser jinked into a yard of space and pulled a shot wide from 20 yards, while Buxton was foiled by an offside flag as he got a foot to a free kick from the left and sent it goalwards.
Lincoln began the second half with a flurry of corners but soon the Brewers were pressing again and Templeton, nicking the ball from a defender, had a shot pushed away by Vickers.
Daniel’s most effective ball in from the left of the game was poked wide by Lucas Akins at the near post, an awkward chance, but the Imps had the bit between their teeth and began threatening on the counter, with the scorer, Andrews, looking particularly dangerous on the right wing.
As time began to run out, there was a shout for a penalty as Fraser went to ground in a scramble in the box but it did not look conclusive.
Burton’s frustration was summed up early in stoppage time by Stephen Quinn. The Irishman had again been their stand-out player but he scythed Anderson down on the right touchline and the free kick led to Jorge Grant hitting a shot against the bar.
Lincoln confirmed the win their efforts had deserved in the last minute of stoppage time when Anderson broke again down the right and pulled the ball back for former Burton loanee Tyler Walker to turn in.
The Brewers need a breather. This week, they have one - and then it is a trip to leaders Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forward Elijah Adebayo got the only goal of the game in the first minute of the second half.
A superb defensive display secured the three points but Clarke was unhappy with his team’s possession of the ball.
“We have to be better with our back to play, strikers look after the ball,” he said. “I can’t remember how many times we’ve given the ball away with our back to play.
“Just keep the ball, find the pass, make another movement. The basics of possession football.
“It’s something we have to look at and obviously improve on.
“Against Chelsea I thought for 70 minutes we were outstanding with the ball, moving it on the front foot.
“But it’s three points away from home which in this league is very hard to come by.
“We’ll take the positives, I know I’m just a miserable git but it’s just the way I am.”
Midfielder Stuart Sinclair returned to the side after missing eight games through an unspecified injury.
The experienced battler lasted the full 90 minutes at Vale Park and Clarke was pleased to have him back.
“It’s nice to have the beard running around isn’t it,” he added. “His heart and desire. It’s testament to the way he looks after himself to get 90 minutes.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">AC Milan hold meeting with Barcelona as they consider swoop for €10m-rated starlet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AC Milan officials reportedly met with their Barcelona counterparts on Friday as they line up a potential bid for defender Jean-Clair Todibo.
The 19-year-old joined the Catalan giants in January earlier this year, but since arriving at the Nou Camp he has struggled to secure regular playing time.
After making just two appearances in La Liga in the second half of the last campaign, he has been limited to just two more additional outings so far this season.
With Samuel Umtiti recovering from injury to take his place above the youngster in the pecking order to challenge Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet for a starting berth under coach Ernesto Valverde, it’s questionable as to whether Todibo’s situation will change any time soon.
In turn, perhaps an exit could be the ideal solution for all parties, and now Calciomercato, via the paper edition of Sport, suggest that Milan technical director Paolo Maldini met with Barcelona officials in Milan last Friday to discuss Todibo.
It’s added that the Frenchman is valued at around €10m, and that Barca want to include a buy-back clause in the deal in the event he goes on to establish himself as a top player and fulfils his potential.
Time will tell if that’s a deal that Milan are willing to do, as while Mattia Caldara is closing in on a return after an injury nightmare since joining the club, summer signing Leo Duarte suffered a serious setback at the end of last month.
With that in mind, perhaps coach Stefano Pioli needs more in that department, although given that they’ve struggled at the other end of the pitch for the most part so far this season having scored just 16 goals in 15 league games, the defence is arguably not the main priority.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">December 9, 2019
Lorenzo Tanos
Despite Anthony Rendon’s previous comments about wanting to end his MLB career at the age of 35, a new report suggests that the 29-year-old third baseman, who last played for the Washington Nationals, might prefer a seven-year contract in free agency, with the Texas Rangers still ranking as a leading candidate for his services.
Citing The Athletic‘s Ken Rosenthal, SBNation blog Lone Star Ball wrote on Sunday that Rendon’s agent, Scott Boras, is looking for teams willing to sign his client to a seven-year deal that would keep him under contract until his age-36 season. As noted, this goes against previous rumors that suggested the slugger prefers a shorter-term deal with a higher average annual value.
Regarding Rendon’s potential destinations in free agency, Lone Star Ball explained that the Rangers are still among the favorites to sign him this offseason. The publication pointed out that the former Nationals star has multiple links to Texas, being a native of the state who played college baseball at Rice University.
“The Rangers apparently see him as the type of veteran star who will age well while providing a solid presence in the clubhouse, and landing Rendon appears to be the team’s top priority this offseason,” the outlet continued.
The above report is not the only one to suggest in recent days that Rendon could be joining the Rangers as a free agent. On Saturday, CBS Sports cited a tweet from Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News, writing that the team’s focus “for the time being” is on signing the superstar third baseman. It wasn’t mentioned whether he’d be seeking a similar deal to what Rosenthal suggested Boras wants, but the outlet brought up multiple reasons why Rendon might end up in Texas — the team’s weakness at third base, its financial capability to sign a marquee free agent, and the fact that the club will be moving to a new ballpark for the 2020 MLB season.

“Granted, it’s Houston — he went to both high school and college (Rice) there — not the Dallas area, but it might make a difference if the money is right,” CBS Sports added, referring to why Rendon might sign with the Rangers as opposed to his actual hometown team, the Houston Astros.
As shown on his Baseball-Reference player page, Rendon has career statistics of 136 home runs, 546 RBIs, and a.290 batting average across seven MLB seasons, all of them with the Nationals. Aside from the Rangers, the former first-round draft pick has also attracted a few other suitors since officially entering free agency, with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies specifically mentioned in recent reports.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Guardiola in shock admission: ‘We are not able to compete with’ Liverpool, Manchester United…</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pep Guardiola has made some extremely surprising comments following his side’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at the weekend.
Manchester City’s defeat sees them lie six points behind Leicester City, who are in 2nd, and a whopping 14 points behind Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.
Instead of suggesting his team fill fight until the end, Pep has intimated his players are simply not cut out to challenge the likes of Liverpool and the rest of Europe’s elite – oddly naming United amongst the list.
“We have to improve and accept it and move forward,” Guardiola told BBC Sport.
“[Manchester] United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counter-attack and you have to accept that.
“That is the level we face against Liverpool, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus. They are the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them.
“Maybe we need to live that as a club to improve, to accept the reality now and improve.”
Guardiola’s City team have been almost invincible for two Premier League seasons, racking up 100 and then 98 points in title winning campaigns – but it feels like the wheels may be coming off.
This term, they’ve already lost four matches – and the complaints about VAR should not hide repeatedly poor defending from whoever it is who get the nod.
Yes, they’ve missed Aymeric Laporte, but John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi are multi-million pound Premier League champions.
We’re not writing City off, even if Pep is. They’re simply too good a side, and we will be watching with intrigue when they face Leicester in 11 days’ time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mooar please! Five reasons why Scarlets fans are falling for Brad Mooar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There’s another Kiwi coach in west Wales and he’s proving a big hit with the fans. RugbyPass takes a look at why Brad Mooar is so popular among the Scarlets faithful.
The results are back
Under Wayne Pivac, Scarlets fans were getting used to being the top Welsh region. In his final season, an injury crisis that was brutal even by modern standards struck and Scarlets were reduced to finishing behind regional rivals Ospreys and Cardiff Blues, missing out on the top tier European competition for the first time in their history.
This season, despite missing fifteen internationals away at the World Cup (many of whom returned injured), they have already picked up five wins – half of last season’s total. A heavy defeat away to Ulster in the Pro14 might have caused more alarm had not nine players been away again with Wales and another 13 still injured, including Gareth Davies, the influential brothers James and Jonathan Davies, props Wyn Jones and Samson Lee, Rhys Patchell, and Aaron Shingler.

A crucial victory away in Bayonne to keep Scarlets hopes alive in the Challenge Cup won’t have done Mooar any harm either. As Cardiff Blues have proved, even Europe’s second tier competition has its charms if you win it.
He’s getting the best out of Steff Evans again
The Scarlets wing’s struggles last season seemed, in many ways, to reflect that of the wider club. He was regularly left to play for Scarlets A to work on his defence and only managed four starts in the league all season, despite injuries biting into the regions’ squad depth. In his absence, the side frequently seemed to miss his attacking spark and their defence was regularly an issue anyway.
This season, he seems to be back to his exciting best. As Evans prepared to lead the side out for his one hundredth regional cap against Toyota Cheetahs, Mooar said, “Steff has been outstanding this season. It’s there for all to see. You can see a real spark, a spring in his step and a smile on his face.”
He also made clear his belief that Evans deserves these rewards, adding, “But what people don’t see is the work and input that he has behind the scenes in team meetings and with other players and how he is continuing to grow himself and helping to grow others. It has been a real pleasure to work with him.”
Evans is very popular with the local fans for his twinkle-toed interventions and his return to form, as well as the vocal backing by the new coach, is a big factor in the current positive feeling towards Mooar. If he can keep it up, fans will start dreaming of another tilt towards the Pro14 title.
He’s put his trust in the wider squad
Evans isn’t the only one who has been making an impression while the big name players were away at the Rugby World Cup. Mooar put his faith in Steff Hughes, long a local favourite, as joint vice-captain of the squad, while captain Ken Owens, and fellow vice-captains the Davies brothers have been away. He has been rewarded with a series of steady performances and displays of leadership as captain, supported by Werner Kruger, the final vice-captain.
Elsewhere, Corey Baldwin and Dan Jones have reminded fans what they can do, Taylor Davies and Jac Morgan have emerged as potential stars, and Kieran Hardy is having a fantastic start to the season. Blade Thomson seems to have put his World Cup disappointment behind him and Josh Macleod continues to put in a shift every week with impressive consistency. Uzair Cassiem, meanwhile, has emerged as a fan favourite on and off the field, enthusiastically engaging with fans before and after his outstanding performances on the field.
Given how many Scarlets players remain injured after the World Cup, and with the Six Nations looming, Mooar’s ability to get the most out of the whole squad bodes well going forward.
He’s balancing flair with pragmatism
The all-court game that Scarlets seek to play is always a little vulnerable to weather and savvy opponents. From the start, Mooar has emphasised his commitment to playing a flair game and has spoken approvingly after games of his players’ desire to play but he has also spoken regularly about playing smart.
Five of Scarlets ten games so far have been within five points (four wins, one last minute loss) and, with the weather getting worse before it gets better, Mooar is right to highlight the need to keep the scoreboard ticking over as well as playing positively. The return of reliable goalkicker Leigh Halfpenny allowed Scarlets to pull away against Bayonne, with the Welsh international kicking four penalties and a conversion to guarantee Scarlets a win.
That said, Scarlets fans are used to a certain attacking style and Mooar has made clear he is not only aware of that but keen to continue the traditions. If he can find a way to maintain a thrilling attacking game while adopting a more streetwise approach when needed, he is going to remain very highly thought of.
He’s engaging the fans
When Mooar was announced, Scarlets general manager Jon Daniels said, “Throughout the process we have been hugely impressed with Brad’s appreciation of Scarlets’ place in the community, his passion for developing players and the research he had done on our heritage.”
And, from the off, Mooar has made sure fans understand he really is aware of Scarlets’ culture and history. From his introductory greeting, when he mentioned knowing, “the Carwyn James, Phil Bennetts, the Delme Thomases, the Quinnells, Ken Owens, Foxy” to his video personally thanking fans for their support, shot against the backdrop of west Wales and referencing the travelling support’s rendition of Sospan Fach, it’s clear Mooar has done his homework.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Boston Celtics player fined for not looking at Chinese flag during national anthem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A FRENCH FORMER NBA player has been reprimanded and fined $1,400 by sports officials in China for not looking at the Chinese flag during the national anthem before a game.
Players with the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) are supposed to stare at the national symbol during the “March of the Volunteers”, but television images showed Guerschon Yabusele, who plays for Nanjing Tongxi Monkey King, had his head down before Friday’s game.
Yabusele was given a “serious warning” and a 10,000-yuan fine for not looking at the flag as required, the CBA said in a statement on Saturday.
Yabusele, who played forward for the Boston Celtics for two seasons before joining the CBA team this year, has not commented on the incident.
China’s government has stepped up the promotion of patriotism under President Xi Jinping, with legislation approved in 2017 to punish anyone who disrespects the national anthem with up to three years in prison.
Opinions on Yabusele’s punishment were divided on Chinese social media.
“He’s happy to take money from China, but he doesn’t respect it,” one person wrote on the popular Weibo social media platform.
“This player must be expelled immediately and his club must be disqualified from the championship,” another said.
But many found the sanction to be harsh.
“It’s nonsense. First, he’s not Chinese. Moreover, he stood up and didn’t make any insulting gesture,” one person wrote.
“He has his head down. So what? In what era does the CBA live? It’s 50 years behind.”
Yabusele is not the first foreign athlete to break patriotic rules in China. Last year, Shandong Luneng’s Brazilian midfielder Diego Tardelli was handed a one-game ban for rubbing his face during the anthem before a game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Davis scores season-high 50 points as Lakers beat Timberwolves</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ANTHONY DAVIS SCORED 50 points to power the Los Angeles Lakers to a 142-125 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday that gave the Western Conference leaders the best record in the NBA.
Davis unleashed his aggression to notch the fourth 50-point game of his career and his first with the Lakers.
He connecting on 20 of 29 shots from the field — with 16 baskets in the paint and not a single three-pointer.
“One for the ages,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.
“The first thing that stands out to me was he had four steals, a block and great defense for all 39 minutes he was out there,” Vogel said. “To be able to perform on that end of the floor and anchor us and still go for 50 in what I feel is an old-school, smashmouth way of getting 50.
Davis, a perfect 10 of 10 from the free-throw line, also pulled down seven rebounds and handed out six assists.
“I just came out aggressive, playing hard,” said Davis, who laid in a floater with 4:39 left to play to reach 50 points for the night. “My team-mates did a good job of finding me.”
LeBron James added 32 points with 13 assists despite finding himself in foul trouble with four in the first half.
Alex Caruso chipped in 16 points as the Lakers improved to 21-3.
Eight Minnesota players scored in double figures.
Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins scored 19 apiece and the Timberwolves led by five late in the second quarter. Ultimately, however, they had no answer for Davis.
In Miami, rookie Tyler Herro scored 27 points and made a go-ahead three-pointer with 38.2 seconds left in overtime to lift the Heat to a 110-105 victory over the Chicago Bulls.
Herro’s heroics included a three-pointer with 7.1 seconds left in regulation, which ended with the score tied at 97-97.
He made three more from beyond the arc in the extra session — including one to tie the game and one to give the Heat the lead for good as Miami improved to 10-0 at home this season and 17-6 overall.
“My team-mates trusted me with the ball,” the 19-year-old reserve guard said. “Every time I get a shot, I have confidence.”
In Dallas, Luka Doncic scored 27 points with seven rebounds and eight assists for his 19th straight game of at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists.
He passed NBA icon Michael Jordan for the most such games in a row since the NBA/ABA merger in the 1970s, but it wasn’t enough to deliver a victory for the Mavs, who fell 110-106 to the Sacramento Kings.
Doncic missed a potential game-tying basket with 7.7 seconds remaining as Sacramento thwarted a late Mavericks rally.
Nemanja Bjelica, who led the Kings with 30 points, closed out the scoring with a layup after Richaun Holmes grabbed the rebound of Doncic’s miss.
Buddy Hield added 26 points for the Kings, former Maverick Harrison Barnes had 13 and Holmes chipped in 12.
The Los Angeles Clippers bounced back from an embarrassing 28-point loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday with a 135-119 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for the Clippers as they improved to 1-1 in their six-game road trip.
“We just wanted to come in and execute,” Leonard said. “Last game, we played very sluggish on the offensive end.
“It’s really not about missing shots or making shots, it’s about getting into our offense and executing and making the right play.”
Paul George added 27 points as five Clippers players scored in double figures. Montrezl Harrell added nine of his 20 in the fourth quarter to help Los Angeles put away the determined Wizards.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rennie's social media polling figures released by Rugby Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rugby Australia has played down one of its most tumultuous years, preferring to laud the fact the majority of its social media followers approved of the new Wallabies coach – Dave Rennie.
The peak body in Australia issued a statement following its final board meeting of the year in Sydney on Monday but it barely touched on the long-running Israel Folau saga.
Last Wednesday Rugby Australia apologised to and reached a settlement with Folau over his sacking, following an Instagram post which said “hell awaits” gay people.
Chief executive Raelene Castle said the settlement amount was confidential but described reports – some of which were as high as $8 million – as “wildly inaccurate”.

In Monday’s statement RA chairman Cameron Clyne only mentioned the Folau issue and potential hurdles with a new pay television deal in the last three paragraphs of the 528-word statement.
Rugby Australia Chairman, Cameron Clyne said: “The Rugby World Cup in Japan was enjoyed over 40,000 Australian travellers – second only behind English fans as the most to attend the tournament. The World Cup also gave Australian Rugby its highest representation of match officials since 2003 with both Angus Gardner and Nic Berry taking the whistle.
“The hard work has already begun for the Wallabies as we build towards France 2023, and we are excited for the future after securing Dave Rennie as the new Wallabies Head Coach.
“It was encouraging to see the Rugby community embrace Dave’s appointment with 86% of Facebook followers and 70% of Instagram followers reacting positively to the news last month.
Clyne highlighted positive developments in player contracting with a host of talented youngsters signing on with Australian Rugby, and continued participation growth across each format.
“The Junior Wallabies came within a point of bringing home the Under 20’s World Cup, and then our Schools & Under 18s team completed an undefeated tour of New Zealand. Importantly, the vast majority of these young stars of the future have been secured in our game long term,” he said.
“The Buildcorp Wallaroos played more Tests than ever before this year and against this backdrop, women’s participation experienced double-digit growth for the third consecutive year.
“As we look towards the 2020 Olympic Games the sevens format is continuing to grow in popularity, with 41 spring and summer competitions kicking off across the country over the past two months.
“Over 30 clubs ran our new Get into Rugby program in clubs in 2019, introducing hundreds of new players of all ages to the game by giving them a sample of each of our three formats – fifteens, sevens and Touch 7s.”
Clyne also addressed recent media speculation surrounding the position of Chief Executive, Raelene Castle and the game’s current media rights negotiations.
“Raelene’s position is not in question and the Board is united behind the process undertaken with Israel Folau.
“2020 is an important year with the broadcast rights negotiations underway and we remain in dialogue with our long-term partner Fox Sports as we aim to deliver the strongest levels of coverage for all of our competitions over the next five-year cycle,” said Clyne.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pierre Gasly's 2019 was certainly a roller coaster as he faced promotion, demotion and a podium all in one season. The Frenchman has admitted he felt as if he had nine races to prove himself after returning to Toro Rosso.
Gasly started the season with Red Bull but the tone for his year was set at Albert Park as he missed out on the points on his debut. It gradually improved but during the summer break Red Bull took the decision to drop Gasly to Toro Rosso, and replace him with Alex Albon and that is how it will stay next season.
However, Gasly showed some signs of a resurgence at Toro Rosso, especially when he finished second in Brazil, ensuing jubilant scenes after the race. The Frenchman has admitted he was shocked and angry after receiving the news of his demotion.
“Of course when I got the news I was really shocked and kind of angry,” Gasly told Motorsportweek.com.
“I don’t feel it was fair, because these first six months were nowhere near what we should have shown. You do care, because you want to be in the fastest car.
“And I’ve tried to make changes in my way, and I’ve been promised things that in the end didn’t happen. There were many things that didn’t go in the right way.
“But at the end of the day this was the situation, it was done, it was passed, I couldn’t change it.
“I thought, okay, I have these nine races where I’m going to show my skills, my speed, my consistency, the things I’ve shown since I started single-seaters until I got to Red Bull."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hamilton: "I grew up like everyone else thinking dairy and meat was good for you"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lewis Hamilton has given an insight into what it is like being a vegan and admitted when he used to eat meat he would wake up feeling groggy.
Hamilton won his sixth Formula 1 Drivers' Championship in 2019, scoring his highest number of points and winning eleven races as he took another step closer to Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles. It was his third Drivers' Championship in a row and his fifth with Mercedes.
The Brit's vegan diet has been well publicised and it has been met with mixed reviews. However, Hamilton has explained how he got into it and how other people can try it out.
“I grew up like everyone else thinking dairy and meat was good for you. I thought I was living healthily and was doing right," Hamilton told Options.
“Then I met a few new people who were vegans, and they started showing me some of the things happening in our world that I was completely oblivious to. It freaked me out. I started to read about it and realised that what I was taught to believe was healthy, was not.
“So, I decided to try and gradually move in that direction, slowly getting rid of red meat, then chicken, then fish until I was ready to fully commit. I wanted to feel for myself how big of a difference it would make.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having a signature boot range as a footballer is considered a dream to many. Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe is the latest to launch his very own boot range, with Nike. Check it out!
In today's game, players such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi play in their own boots while legends such as Ronaldinho and Pele have been privileged enough to run the blades of grass in their signature togs too.

That being said, Nike recently showcased former AS Monaco star Mbappe's signature boots, named the "Bondy Dreams" Mercurial. Bondy is an area in the north-east of Paris, a place where Mbappe says he fell in love with football.
The Nike X Mbappe Bondy selection is exclusive to Europe only, and includes the Air Max 98, a hoodie, a T-shirt, a Nike FC Jersey, a cap and a football.

The winger scored his first goal for the club on his 66th appearance to open the scoring after just 11 minutes, drilling home a low shot into the bottom corner.
He then went on to claim yet another assist for the campaign, delivering the cross for Armand Gnanduillet to head home Blackpool's third goal of the game.
The 33-year-old has now created nine goals for the Seasiders in League One this season and 12 in all competitions.
Feeney is joined by the likes of Kiko Casilla (Leeds United), Jarrod Bowen (Hull City) and Steven Fletcher (Sheffield Wednesday) in the team of the week, which recognises standout individual displays.
Bristol Rovers boss Graham Coughlan, meanwhile, is named manager of the week after his side came from behind to defeat Southend United 4-2 on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Federico Fernandez: 'Newcastle need to build a winning mentality'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Magpies were far from their best against the Saints, but eventually secured a priceless 2-1 victory at St James' Park on Sunday to climb into the top half of the table at the end of a gruelling, but successful week.
A hard-fought 2-2 draw with champions Manchester City and back-to-back victories over Sheffield United and the Saints have left them on 22 points after 16 games, just two shy of fifth-placed Manchester United and confident of adding to their tally over a busy programme between now and the New Year.
Fernandez said: "We are working hard to keep our shape. We feel okay. We took our chances and they are great points.
"We need to enjoy this period and build a winning mentality. You never know where we can arrive at the end of the season, but we take it game by game."
This particular game will be one, other than the result, which Newcastle may well want to forget.
They were simply not at the races before the break and had to rely upon keeper Martin Dubravka to make two fine saves from Nathan Redmond.
Indeed, they did not really find their feet until after Danny Ings' 52nd-minute opener and even then only as a result of Andy Carroll's introduction in place of £40million summer signing Joelinton, whose crisis of confidence is ongoing.
Carroll subjected central defenders Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek to a physical onslaught and the only surprise was that it was he who provided the cross for Jonjo Shelvey to head the Magpies level with 22 minutes remaining rather than the other way around.
The direct approach paid dividends once again three minutes from time when the ball was cleared to another substitute, Sean Longstaff, and keeper Alex McCarthy could only parry his skidding drive to Fernandez, who needed no second invitation to dispatch it into the roof of the net.
He said: "I saw Longs have a great shot and I followed the ball. I was in the right place at the right moment. I was very happy to score here at home with all of the fans."
If there was satisfaction on Tyneside, there was frustration for Southampton as they headed off on the long journey back to the South Coast empty-handed despite enjoying the better of much of the game and creating a series of chances.
Manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: "That's the next step we have to go in such tight games, to be more clinical in that moment.
"In the third game in a week where we have invested a lot, it's normal that the concentration is not the highest when you have such moments, but in that moment, you must know that this can decide the game and that when you are one up, you must take something here.
"It's really a pity."

Cristiano Jr made headlines earlier in the year after his incredible goalscoring exploits were pointed out.
By the end of October, he was sitting on 58 goals and had a further 18 assists in just 28 appearances this season.

He has now added to his brilliant campaign by winning the "Cavour Trophy" after beating Chieri 3-2 in the final.
Ronaldo's eldest son, who scored three goals at the tournament, was named the best striker, as Giovani Bianconeri, who covers Juventus' youth teams, pointed out.
As a consequence, his father posted a picture of Cristiano Jr and the best striker trophy on Instagram, along with the captain: "I'm a proud daddy".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roy Hodgson hails "superb professional" Jairo Riedewald</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Ajax academy graduate was introduced at half-time of the goalless draw with Watford, after makeshift left-back Jeffrey Schlupp suffered a muscle injury.
Before coming on at Vicarage Road, forgotten man Riedewald had not played in a top-flight game since a 3-2 win over Brighton in April 2018.
It has been a frustrating time for the 23-year-old since moving to Selhurst Park in July 2017 for a deal worth a reported £7.9million.
Riedewald, a centre-back by trade, signed for Palace under his old Ajax manager Frank De Boer, but has been given limited opportunities in recent campaigns and only made four appearances last season.
"Of course he has been frustrated, but he's been a superb professional," Hodgson said.
"He comes in all the time, gets on with his work and never ever complains. He doesn't sulk or show he is particularly unhappy, but of course he is frustrated. Anyone would be.
"He was bought by the club – by the previous manager – two-and-a-half years ago and cost a fair amount of money by our standards.
"When you then don't get a chance to play in the position you thought you were coming to play in, because the manager changes and decides he wants other people, it must be frustrating, but I have to take my hat off to him.
"He has not allowed that to show and he is a popular player with the others simply because he gets on with his work in a quiet and meaningful way.
"And when push comes to shove and we've had to ask him to really step up to the plate, he has done so."
Injuries mean Riedewald may now be handed a rare start when Palace entertain Brighton on Monday week, with Patrick Van Aanholt out with a hamstring issue and Schlupp set to join him on the treatment table.
While he would again be out of position at left-back, Riedewald showed at Watford he is capable of performing that role.
"He is an intelligent player, he reads the game very well and uses the quality he has to good effect," Hodgson added.
"On several occasions his composure and calmness on the ball was good and there is no doubt he will relish the opportunity if he continues in that position."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mikel Arteta 'first choice for Arsenal job'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since the Gunners made the decision to part ways with the Spaniard last month, Freddie Ljungberg has taken over on an interim basis.
However, with the North London side having picked up just one point from Premier League fixtures against Norwich City and Brighton & Hove Albion respectively, the club's board has stepped up their efforts to bring in a long-term replacement.
According to The Express, Arsenal have now settled on Arteta as their first choice, despite the fact that the Spaniard missed out on the role just 18 months ago.
The report suggests that Arsenal now face a battle to tempt their former player into leaving his position at the Etihad Stadium midway through the campaign.
Pep Guardiola has recently insisted that Arteta will at least see out the season in the North-West.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antonio Valencia tells Manchester United what to do with Paul Pogba</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United captain Antonio Valencia believes Paul Pogba needs love in order to shine at the club.
The midfielder has not played for the club since the draw against Arsenal in September due to an ankle injury and there was speculation the France international was delaying his return ahead of a possible January transfer.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shut down those reports and Valencia has explained what he thinks United need to do to get the best out of the 26-year-old on his playing return in the coming weeks.
"Pogba is a star, I've known him since he was 14-years-old. Do you know what you need? Love," he told Mundo Deportivo. "I have heard many rumors about Zidane and Real Madrid but he never said anything. He is reserved and an intelligent guy. If in United they give him that love, Pogba will shine as before."
United put in their best two performances of the season this week with wins against Tottenham and Manchester City and Valencia believes the club need to be patient with Solskjaer and more positive results will come.
"This season you have to make up the team, play well and understand each other," Valencia said. "And next year, it is important to enter the Champions League. Patience, the results will come."
Despite the form of Scott McTominay and Fred, Solskjaer intends to accommodate World Cup Pogba winner in any side he picks. "Of course, Paul's going to play when he gets his fitness," Solskjaer said. "He's one of the best players in the world when he's in form.
"We just need to give him time to be 100 per cent fit. It might be 45 minutes, the first game. It might be half-an-hour, it might be 90. It depends on what game he comes back in and I'm looking to get Paul back to where I had him a year ago."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Capable of hitting six on any ground: Shivam Dube</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shivam Dube is confident that he can "clear any ground" in the world after providing a demo of his six-hitting prowess against the West Indies in the second T20 International, albeit in a losing cause.
Promoted up the order at No 3, Dube smashed 54 off 30 balls with four sixes, three of which came in one over from rival skipper Kieron Pollard but India failed to defend a target of 170 with three-match series levelled at 1-1.
"I think this ground is big but I have the capability of clearing any ground. You might have seen today also and that’s the capability I have," the big-bodied Dube said at the post-match press conference.
Initially, Dube was unable to clear the ropes as he relied more on power than timing which didn't work for him. However the Mumbai player believes that power will always remain his USP.
"I think that's my strength and I always go like that only," he added. When he was struggling with his timing, it was vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who urged the youngster to stay calm and back his strength, which was exactly the advice that he needed at that juncture.
"I think I was given the opportunity to bat at No.3 and I think it was a big deal for me. The pressure was there at the starting obviously - international match.
"After that, Rohit bhai helped me and he said 'stay calm and back your strength'. I think that was the motivation I needed from a senior player. Then, I got one six and did really well after that," he added. Dube said that dropped catches are a part and parcel of this game and this was a one-off.
"Yes, we dropped catches and it was unfortunate. Had we held onto them, that would have changed everything. But then any team can drop catches – it doesn't matter. I think we are the best team. We had a tough match today, but we will come back next match," he said.

It comes after Blackpool's owner officially opened the state-of-the-art education and community centre ahead of Saturday's game against Fleetwood Town.
Before cutting the ribbon with a pair of comically oversized scissors, Sadler provided some words to those supporters in attendance.
"The Community Trust is quite clearly the link between the football club and the community," he said.
"One of the reasons I bought the club in the first place was to strengthen the links between the club and the town.
"This building is a great symbol of that."
The centre, which has already been functional for six weeks, is based on the site of the old club shop and ticket office in the North West corner of Bloomfield Road.
It has since been transformed into an education and community centre, which includes four tailor-made classrooms, a family and game zone, community gym and a physical activity space.
The facility has been developed with £286,000 funding from the Premier League and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, through the Football Foundation and a further £125,000 from the Community Trust itself.
The Trust has been given a 25-year lease on the area.
The facility will be used to host Blackpool FC Sports College, home to the Trusts BTEC Education, Degree and Traineeship courses, as well as community-based activity, including sporting memories, veterans’ social groups and Premier League Kicks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Chiefs Got The Edge Over Celtic  </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bloemfontein Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema applauded his Kaizer Chiefs counterpart Ernst Middendorp after Amakhosi came from behind three times during their Absa Premiership clash at the weekend to eventually win 5-3.
Celtic exposed Chiefs’ lackluster defending in the first half, but could not keep up later on in the game as the log leaders fought back in the eight-goal thriller.

“We created chances and played the way we wanted to play and until we conceded the two goals. We had done our homework and tried everything, but they proved too strong,” Seema told reporters after the game.
“If someone is stronger than you in certain departments, you will always come out second best. They saw that set pieces would surely help them get the edge over us. We will have to go back and work hard again.”
Seema said part of their surrender later in the match was due to not having their regulars against a full strength Chiefs outfit.
“Not making an excuse, but we are patching up here and there because of the injuries – the experienced guys are not there. And when you come up against Chiefs, with a very good coach that I know very well, it was always going to be difficult,” the Celtic mentor explained.  
“We haven’t played with the same squad we started the season with because of the injuries. We lost another centre-back again through suspension for the next match.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">In his absence and on his comeback, striker Tammy Abraham shows why he is so important to Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tammy Abraham has emerged as Chelsea’s talisman thanks to a breakthrough season that has taken his side to the brink of the Champions League last 16.
Just 18 months ago, Abraham was one of a host of Chelsea players packed off for yet another loan spell that seemed to indicate his chances of ever shining with the Blues were slim to non-existent.
But Abraham’s time in the Championship with Aston Villa proved the making of the young striker and Chelsea are reaping the rewards.
Now Abraham stands as the undisputed leader of Chelsea’s attack, with his powerful presence and predatory instincts making him an essential part of Frank Lampard’s precocious team.
If Chelsea are to secure the win they need to make the Champions League knockout stages, then it is Abraham who is likely to play the key role in the Group H clash with Lille at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.
Abraham is just 22 and is playing only his second season in the top-flight, but the England international’s huge value to Chelsea was clear to see over the last 10 days.
When he was sidelined with a hip injury for their London derby against West Ham, Abraham’s absence left Chelsea looking impotent as they slumped to a shock 1-0 defeat.
But just days later, Abraham was back in the starting line-up and Chelsea were revitalised as he produced a goal and an assist in a 2-1 win against Aston Villa.
Abraham, a product of Chelsea’s youth academy, already has 11 Premier League goals this season and 12 in all competitions.
It is a far cry from his dismal loan spell at Swansea in 2017-18 when his lack of goals and subdued performances led some to suggest the Londoner wasn’t cut out for the Premier League.
But Abraham hit 26 goals in 40 matches on loan at Villa, helping them win promotion from the Championship and catching Lampard’s eye during his one-season reign at second tier Derby.
When he took charge at Chelsea, Lampard was unable to sign players due to a transfer ban, a predicament that accelerated Abraham’s rise to the first-team.
He has taken his opportunity emphatically but, as Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta points out, it isn’t just goals that make Abraham so vital.
“Not only is he scoring goals he is playing for the team, recovering the ball; he made a tackle in our own half that was an amazing effort for him,” Azpilicueta said after the Villa game.
“He made an assist as well. I am not just looking into his goals as a number because he is doing more than that.”
Asked just how far Abraham can go after his superb first half of the season, Azpilicueta said: “I am confident that he can get many more goals because of the way he is working and improving.
“It is amazing and he has the potential to go even higher. We know we are still in December with a lot of games but with his passion and hunger, he is capable of getting to the top, for sure.
“He showed his desire in pre-season to be a striker for Chelsea. It is something he has dreamt about and he worked for it all the way through the academy. He got his chance and is making the most of it.”
Lampard believes Abraham’s desire to make his mark will keep him firing on all cylinders as Chelsea enter the hectic Christmas programme with a do-or-die showdown with Lille.
Lampard’s team can’t be certain of progressing to the last 16 unless they win their final group game and the boss said: “He’s a personality that’s growing in our dressing room every day with his enthusiasm and his will to win.
“All you say is, as they come, game after game, can you keep scoring, can you stay hungry and what can you do for the team.”

Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - one of Bale's former clubs - have been linked with an approach for the 30-year-old during the January window.
However, reports in Spain indicate that the attacker is not interested in returning to a league which involves frequent pressure from the media, instead preferring to move to a division which comes under less scrutiny.
While Real are said to be happy to part ways with Bale, it has been claimed that Los Blancos want to include him in a part-exchange deal for United midfielder Paul Pogba as they bid to avoid shelling out a large fee for the World Cup winner.
Bale still has over two-and-a-half years left on his contract at the Bernabeu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">World chess champion Magnus Carlsen on the brink of reaching top spot in Premier League Fantasy Football as he climbs to SIXTH in table of over seven million people thanks to Jamie Vardy and Mohamed Salah</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World chess champion Magnus Carlsen has climbed to an astonishing sixth place in the Premier League Fantasy Football rankings!
Carlsen has dominated the world of chess for around a decade now, but it seems he also flourishes in the world of fantasy football. 
The Norwegian's team, named Kjell Ankedal, has risen to sixth out of 7 million players worldwide after a gameweek where captaining Mohamed Salah against Bournemouth paid off with a 26-point return.  
Carlsen's team also featured standout weekend performers Heung-Son Min, who scored a wonderful solo goal against Burnley, and Jamie Vardy who scored for the eighth Premier League game running. 
The 29-year-old is a known lover of Premier League football, and is often seen kicking a ball about before chess tournaments worldwide. 
He is currently in London competing at the London Chess Classic at Olympia.

Middendorp compared his experienced defenders to teenage youngsters who are still cutting their teeth in the junior ranks.
“Entertaining game, I think the number of goals is good for supporters, there’s no doubt about it. First half I think we had a huge attitude issue, not really in the game, we didn’t want to move like we should, could be,” Middendorp told SuperSport TV.
“Like we have done to get this position we’re in at the moment. Much better in the second-half, I think in the end fully deserved three points for us and it’s good for us.
“I would not say it’s under-12, then I would insult the under-12 defensive work. I don’t know what’s below, if there’s an under-8 or an under-17, mean really, national team players and there’s nothing to blame, as I said it’s not the quality, it’s just the attitude,” said the 61-year-old.
“Where we’re sitting now we think we can do less, we cannot. We have to fight each and every team first on the ground and then we can score and celebrate. But if you go into a game and you want to just do a little bit of a Prima donna, there’s no chance to win a game in this league.”
Chiefs next face Maritzburg United away in their last league game of 2019. The game is set to be played at Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday, December 22.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Maddison 'on verge of new Leicester City deal'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After contributing 12 goals and numerous assists in 51 Premier League appearances for the Foxes, the 23-year-old has been linked with a future transfer to another top-flight club.
Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are all said to hold an interest in the playmaker, who recently made his international debut with England.
However, according to talkSPORT, Maddison is ready to sign a new long-term contract with the East Midlands outfit in the near future.
While Maddison still has over three-and-a-half years left on his existing deal, Leicester are seemingly ready to reward the former Norwich City man for his recent impressive form.
